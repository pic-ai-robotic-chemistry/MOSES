In an electrochemical sensor utilizing an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) for detecting quinine, the mechanism of displacement involves the interaction between quinine, methylene blue, and beta-cyclodextrin.

1. **Complex Formation**: Initially, methylene blue (MB) forms a complex with beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD). Beta-cyclodextrin is a cyclic oligosaccharide that has a hydrophobic cavity, which can encapsulate hydrophobic molecules like methylene blue. This complexation stabilizes methylene blue in solution and allows it to be detected electrochemically.

2. **Quinine Introduction**: When quinine is introduced into the system, it competes with methylene blue for binding to the beta-cyclodextrin. Quinine is a larger and more hydrophobic molecule compared to methylene blue, which allows it to effectively displace methylene blue from the β-CD cavity.

3. **Displacement Mechanism**: The displacement occurs because quinine has a higher affinity for the β-CD than methylene blue. As quinine binds to the β-CD, it effectively pushes methylene blue out of the cavity. This process is driven by the differences in binding affinities and the thermodynamics of the system.

4. **Electrochemical Detection**: Once methylene blue is displaced, its concentration in the solution decreases, which can be monitored electrochemically. The reduction in the electrochemical signal corresponding to methylene blue indicates the presence of quinine. The change in current or potential can be quantitatively related to the concentration of quinine in the sample.

In summary, the IDA for quinine detection relies on the competitive binding of quinine and methylene blue to beta-cyclodextrin, where quinine's higher affinity leads to the displacement of methylene blue, allowing for electrochemical detection of quinine.
