In an electrochemical sensor utilizing an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) for detecting quinine, the mechanism of quinine displacing methylene blue from beta-cyclodextrin involves several key interactions and principles of molecular recognition.

1. **Complex Formation**: Initially, methylene blue (MB) forms a stable inclusion complex with beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD). The hydrophobic cavity of β-CD encapsulates the methylene blue, which is a cationic dye. This complexation is driven by hydrophobic interactions, as the aromatic rings of methylene blue fit well within the hydrophobic cavity of β-CD.

2. **Quinine Interaction**: Quinine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, has a structure that allows it to interact with β-CD. Quinine is also a hydrophobic molecule, and it can fit into the cavity of β-CD. When quinine is introduced into the system, it competes with methylene blue for binding to β-CD.

3. **Displacement Mechanism**: The displacement occurs because quinine has a higher affinity for β-CD compared to methylene blue. This can be attributed to several factors, including the size, shape, and specific interactions (such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces) between quinine and β-CD. As quinine binds to β-CD, it effectively displaces methylene blue from the complex.

4. **Electrochemical Detection**: Once methylene blue is displaced, the concentration of free methylene blue in the solution decreases. Since methylene blue is electroactive, its concentration can be monitored electrochemically. The decrease in the electrochemical signal corresponding to methylene blue indicates the presence of quinine, allowing for its quantification.

In summary, the IDA for detecting quinine relies on the competitive binding of quinine and methylene blue to beta-cyclodextrin, where quinine's higher affinity leads to the displacement of methylene blue, which can then be detected electrochemically.
