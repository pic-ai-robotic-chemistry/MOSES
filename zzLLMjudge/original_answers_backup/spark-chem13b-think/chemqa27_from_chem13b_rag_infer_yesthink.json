These interactions are crucial in various biological and chemical processes, such as enzyme catalysis, molecular recognition, and drug delivery. Here are some key examples:\n\n1. **Cyclodextrins**: These are cyclic oligosaccharides with a hydrophobic inner cavity and hydrophilic rims. They can host various guests through multiple non-covalent interactions, including cation-π interactions when guest molecules possess both cations and π-electron systems (e.g., aromatic rings).\n\n2. **Calixarenes**: These are synthetic receptors composed of phenolic units linked together, forming a truncated cone structure.

For instance, pillar[5]arene derivatives can complex cations like sodium and potassium along with aromatic rings through simultaneous cation-π and hydrophobic interactions.\n\n4. **Cavity-containing Receptors**: Cavitands and other hosts with predefined cavities can accommodate guests through a combination of size, shape, and charge complementarity. When these cavities also provide a suitable π-system for interaction with cations (e.g., aromatic rings), cation-π interactions become significant (e.g., tetramethylammonium cations binding to cavitands via cation-π interactions).\n\n5. **Macrocyclic Ionophores**: These are specifically designed to complex cations within their ring structures. Macrocycl[2.2.2]octatetraene, for instance, can bind cations such as potassium or sodium through cation-π interactions, leveraging both the ring's electron system and its spatial arrangement.\n\n6. **Receptors with Quaternary Ammonium Groups**: Hosts containing quaternary ammonium centers, such as certain dendrimers or polymeric systems, can engage in cation-π interactions with aromatic guests. The positively charged ammonium groups attract cations, while the aromatic regions facilitate π-interactions.\n\nIn summary, supramolecular hosts capable of cation-π interactions often feature electron-rich frameworks (like aromatic systems) alongside functional groups that stabilize cations (such as quaternary ammonium sites).

Water-soluble hosts like sulfonated CDs exploit both charge shielding and hydrophobic effects.\n\n8. **Entropy Changes**: The release or consumption of ordered solvent molecules (e.g., water structuring) modulates the free energy of binding. Larger entropic gains from displaced solvent often drive complex formation, especially in aqueous media.\n\n9. **Guest Flexibility**: Conformable guests (e.g., flexible azobenzene linkers) adapt their shape to optimize interactions, enhancing binding affinity. Conversely, rigid guests may require precise host cavities for effective encapsulation.\n\n10. **pH and Chemical Microenvironment**: Protonation states of host/guest functional groups influence binding. Hosts with acidic/basic sites adjust reactivity under varying pH, while guest pKa values dictate protonation-dependent complexation.\n\nThese factors often interplay synergistically.
