### **Test # #1: Chemical Knowledge and Reasoning: Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) System**

**Scenario Description**

An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a powerful sensing method based on supramolecular chemistry, widely used for the detection of various analytes. A typical IDA system consists of three core components:

1.  **Host (A):** A molecule possessing a recognition cavity or binding site.
2.  **Indicator (B):** A guest molecule that exhibits a signal response (e.g., in its color or fluorescence).
3.  **Analyte (C):** The target guest molecule to be detected.

The principle of operation involves two steps:

1.  The Host (A) and Indicator (B) bind to form a supramolecular complex, `A·B`. This binding event causes a significant change in the indicator's signal (e.g., fluorescence quenching or a color change).
2.  When the Analyte (C) is introduced, it competes for the host's cavity. If C binds to A more strongly than B does, it will displace the indicator, forming a new complex, `A·C`, and releasing the free indicator B. This displacement restores the indicator's signal to its original state, thus enabling the detection of the analyte C.

### **Test # #14: Chemical Knowledge and Reasoning: Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) System**

**Scenario Description**

An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a powerful sensing method based on supramolecular chemistry, widely used for the detection of various analytes. A typical IDA system consists of three core components:

1.  **Host (A):** A molecule possessing a recognition cavity or binding site.
2.  **Indicator (B):** A guest molecule that exhibits a signal response (e.g., in its color or fluorescence).
3.  **Analyte (C):** The target guest molecule to be detected.

The principle of operation involves two steps:

1.  The Host (A) and Indicator (B) bind to form a supramolecular complex, `A·B`. This binding event causes a significant change in the indicator's signal (e.g., fluorescence quenching or a color change).
2.  When the Analyte (C) is introduced, it competes for the host's cavity. If C binds to A more strongly than B does, it will displace the indicator, forming a new complex, `A·C`, and releasing the free indicator B. This displacement restores the indicator's signal to its original state, thus enabling the detection of the analyte C.

### **Test # #20: Chemical Knowledge and Reasoning: Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) System**

**Scenario Description**

An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a powerful sensing method based on supramolecular chemistry, widely used for the detection of various analytes. A typical IDA system consists of three core components:

1.  **Host (A):** A molecule possessing a recognition cavity or binding site.
2.  **Indicator (B):** A guest molecule that exhibits a signal response (e.g., in its color or fluorescence).
3.  **Analyte (C):** The target guest molecule to be detected.

The principle of operation involves two steps:

1.  The Host (A) and Indicator (B) bind to form a supramolecular complex, `A·B`. This binding event causes a significant change in the indicator's signal (e.g., fluorescence quenching or a color change).
2.  When the Analyte (C) is introduced, it competes for the host's cavity. If C binds to A more strongly than B does, it will displace the indicator, forming a new complex, `A·C`, and releasing the free indicator B. This displacement restores the indicator's signal to its original state, thus enabling the detection of the analyte C.
