{'summary': 'Typically, molecules acting as guests for supramolecular hosts are organic, hydrophobic, and capable of forming non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, electrostatic, and hydrophobic effects, including amino acids, peptides, aromatic compounds, and hydrophobic hydrocarbons.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules are often organic, hydrophobic, and capable of non-covalent interactions.', 'Common guest molecules include amino acids, peptides, aromatic compounds, hydrocarbons, and drug molecules.', 'Quantitative affinity data such as binding constants (e.g., 10^6 M^-1 for certain host-guest complexes) indicate strong interactions in some systems.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts such as calixarenes, cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, and cavitands are designed to recognize and bind specific guest molecules through non-covalent interactions.', 'Binding mechanisms often involve hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and π-π stacking.', 'Quantitative data, such as binding constants (e.g., 10^6 M^-1), reflect the strength and specificity of host-guest interactions.', 'Structural features like bowl-shaped cavities, hydrophobic interiors, and functional groups on hosts facilitate selective guest binding.', 'Applications include drug delivery, molecular sensing, and separation technologies, where guest molecules are typically organic, hydrophobic, or biologically relevant compounds.'], 'relationships': ['Host molecules like calixarenes, cyclodextrins, and cucurbiturils preferentially bind hydrophobic, aromatic, or charged organic molecules.', 'Binding affinity and selectivity are driven by hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and π-π stacking.', 'Quantitative affinity data (e.g., binding constants) correlate with the strength of guest-host interactions, often in the range of 10^4 to 10^8 M^-1.']}
