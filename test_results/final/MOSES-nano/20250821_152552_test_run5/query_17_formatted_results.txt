{'summary': 'Cage molecules and macrocycles are both used in molecular recognition and host-guest chemistry, but cages are primarily designed for selective binding within larger cavities, while macrocycles serve as versatile hosts for various guest molecules, including peptides and ions.', 'key_points': ['Cages are defined by their large cavities capable of accommodating multiple residues, used for selective binding.', 'Macrocycles are large ring-shaped molecules with well-defined cavities, used for binding a wide range of guest molecules, including peptides, ions, and aromatic hydrocarbons.', 'Macrocycles like CB(7), calixarenes, and pillararenes are extensively studied for their host-guest complexation abilities, with affinities reaching nanomolar to micromolar ranges.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles are employed in sensing, molecular recognition, and nanostructure applications, with some overlap in their use for selective binding and complex formation.'], 'background_information': ['Cage molecules are often designed with large, enclosed cavities that can host multiple residues or larger guest molecules, making them suitable for applications like selective binding, encapsulation, and catalysis.', 'Macrocycles, such as cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, and calixarenes, are characterized by their cyclic, preorganized structures that facilitate high-affinity host-guest interactions, often used in drug delivery, sensing, and molecular recognition.', 'The structural features of macrocycles—rigidity, cavity size, and functionalization—are critical for their binding selectivity and affinity, with some macrocycles capable of forming stable complexes with peptides, amino acids, and biomolecules.', 'Both classes of molecules are integral to supramolecular chemistry, with overlapping uses in sensing scaffolds, nanostructures, and host-guest systems, though cages tend to be larger and more flexible, while macrocycles are more rigid and structurally defined.'], 'relationships': ['Cages and macrocycles both serve as host molecules in supramolecular chemistry, but cages are generally larger and designed for accommodating multiple residues, whereas macrocycles are optimized for specific guest recognition within their cyclic cavities.', 'Macrocycles like CB(7) and calixarenes can form stable complexes with peptides and small organic molecules, with affinities reaching nanomolar levels, similar to some cage molecules used for selective binding.', 'The structural design of macrocycles often involves preorganization and controlled flexibility, which enhances their binding specificity, a feature also exploited in cage molecules but with different architectural considerations.']}
