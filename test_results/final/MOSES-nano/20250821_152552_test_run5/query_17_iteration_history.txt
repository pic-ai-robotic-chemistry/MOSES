[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': "The query is asking for a comparative analysis of cage molecules and macrocycles, focusing on their typical applications in chemistry and related fields. It seeks to understand the distinct uses of each class, such as in host-guest chemistry, catalysis, or materials science, and whether there are any overlaps in their functionalities or applications. The mention of 'cage molecules' suggests a class of three-dimensional, often polyhedral, structures designed for encapsulation or specific reactivity, while 'macrocycles' refer to large ring-shaped molecules with potential for complexation. The tool analysis indicates that these classes are well-characterized in terms of their structures and functions, enabling a detailed comparison of their applications and overlaps.", 'hypothetical_answer': 'Cage molecules, such as metal-organic cages and supramolecular hosts, are primarily used in applications like molecular encapsulation, targeted drug delivery, separation processes, and as catalysts in asymmetric synthesis. Their three-dimensional, polyhedral architectures enable selective guest inclusion and stabilization of reactive intermediates. Macrocycles, including cyclodextrins, crown ethers, and porphyrins, are widely employed in host-guest chemistry, sensors, ion transport, and as components in electronic or photonic devices. Both cage molecules and macrocycles share overlapping uses in molecular recognition and encapsulation, facilitating selective binding of ions or small molecules. For example, certain macrocyclic ligands can form cage-like structures upon complexation, blurring the lines between the two classes. Overall, while their structural differences influence specific applications, their common feature of molecular encapsulation underpins many overlapping uses in chemistry and materials science.',
