{'summary': 'Aromatic macrocycles, porphyrins, and calixarenes are known supramolecular hosts that can bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions, with specific structural features and electronic properties facilitating this mode of binding.', 'key_points': ['Aromatic macrocycles, including classes like cyclophanes and calixarene derivatives, are structurally capable of engaging in anion-π interactions due to their aromatic and cage-like architectures.', 'Porphyrins, characterized by their frontier orbitals (HOMO, LUMO, etc.) and intense extinction coefficients, can participate in anion-π interactions, especially when their electronic properties are tuned.', 'Calixarenes, as macrocyclic hosts with bowl-shaped cavities and various modifications (upper and lower rim), are versatile platforms for anion binding, including via anion-π interactions, owing to their aromatic nature and structural adaptability.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are non-covalent attractions between anions and electron-deficient π-systems, often facilitated by aromatic macrocycles with electron-poor aromatic surfaces.', 'Porphyrins are macrocyclic compounds with extensive conjugation and tunable electronic properties, making them suitable for various non-covalent interactions, including anion-π, especially when their frontier orbitals are appropriately aligned.', 'Calixarenes are cyclic oligomers with phenolic units, capable of functionalization at rims to enhance selectivity and binding strength for anions, including through anion-π interactions when aromatic substituents are introduced.', 'The structural features such as bowl shape, cavity size, and electronic properties (e.g., electron deficiency, frontier orbital energies) are critical determinants for the ability of these hosts to engage in anion-π interactions.', 'The presence of electron-withdrawing groups, modifications at specific positions (meso, beta, upper rim, lower rim), and the overall aromaticity influence the strength and specificity of anion-π binding.', 'These hosts are extensively studied in supramolecular chemistry for applications in sensing, molecular recognition, and transport, where anion-π interactions provide a unique binding mode that complements hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.'], 'relationships': ['Aromatic macrocycles, including cyclophanes and calixarene derivatives, are structurally related as macrocyclic hosts capable of anion-π interactions.', 'Porphyrins, as macrocyclic aromatic compounds with specific frontier orbital configurations, can participate in anion-π interactions, especially when electronic properties are optimized.', 'Calixarenes, as macrocyclic hosts with aromatic components, can be functionalized to enhance anion-π interactions, linking their structural features to their binding capabilities.', 'The electronic properties (e.g., frontier orbitals, extinction coefficients) of porphyrins and their derivatives are directly related to their ability to engage in anion-π interactions, which is also influenced by their dimerization and substitution patterns.', 'Structural modifications at rims and within cavities of calixarenes influence their aromaticity and electron deficiency, thereby affecting their propensity for anion-π interactions.']}
