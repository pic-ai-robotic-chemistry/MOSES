{'summary': 'Yes, there are known supramolecular hosts that are derivatives of calixarenes and feature pyrrole groups, notably calix(4)pyrroles, which can be structurally integrated into calixarene frameworks.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes are macrocyclic compounds with a bowl-shaped structure, capable of hosting various guest molecules through non-covalent interactions, and are used in supramolecular chemistry for sensing, recognition, and delivery applications.', 'Calix(4)pyrroles are a specific class of calixarene derivatives that incorporate pyrrole units, which are heterocyclic compounds containing NH groups capable of hydrogen bonding, thus enhancing their anion-binding capabilities.', 'Calix(4)pyrroles are formed by condensation reactions involving ketones and pyrroles, resulting in fixed cone conformations that can bind anions such as halides, nitrates, and other negatively charged species.', 'These derivatives can be further modified to improve water solubility and selectivity, making them suitable as supramolecular hosts in aqueous environments.', 'The structural features of calix(4)pyrroles include meso-carbon bridges and pyrrole units with NH groups, which are critical for their binding properties and conformational stability.'], 'background_information': ['Calixarenes are a versatile class of macrocyclic compounds widely studied in supramolecular chemistry for their ability to form host-guest complexes. Their structural flexibility allows for functionalization at the upper and lower rims, enabling tailored recognition properties.', 'Calix(4)pyrroles are a subclass of calixarene derivatives characterized by the incorporation of pyrrole rings, which are heterocyclic compounds with a five-membered ring containing four carbons and one nitrogen. The NH groups in pyrroles are key to their hydrogen bonding and anion recognition capabilities.', 'The fixed cone conformation of calix(4)pyrroles ensures a well-defined hydrophobic pocket suitable for selective binding of anions, which is exploited in sensor design and molecular recognition.', 'The synthesis of calix(4)pyrroles typically involves condensation reactions, often under acidic conditions, leading to macrocycles with specific binding sites. These compounds are studied for applications in sensing, separation, and medicinal chemistry.', 'The structural and functional integration of pyrrole groups into calixarene frameworks enhances their ability to recognize and bind specific anions, making them valuable in developing selective supramolecular hosts for environmental and biomedical applications.'], 'relationships': ['Calix(4)pyrroles are structurally related to calixarenes but are distinguished by the presence of pyrrole units, which confer specific anion-binding properties.', 'Both calixarenes and calix(4)pyrroles can be functionalized to improve solubility and selectivity, often through rim modifications.', 'The structural features such as meso-carbon bridges and pyrrole NH groups are critical for their binding affinity and selectivity.', 'Calix(4)pyrroles can be integrated into larger calixarene frameworks or used as building blocks for more complex supramolecular assemblies, leveraging their binding capabilities.']}
