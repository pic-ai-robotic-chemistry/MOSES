{'summary': 'Known supramolecular hosts that primarily bind anions through anion-π interactions include calixarenes, porphyrins, macrocycles, and aromatic macrocycles, especially those with electron-deficient aromatic rings.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes with bowl-shaped, hydrophobic cavities and electron-deficient aromatic rings are capable of engaging in anion-π interactions, particularly when functionalized with electron-withdrawing groups.', 'Porphyrins, characterized by intense extinction coefficients and specific meso and beta-position functionalization sites, can participate in anion-π interactions due to their aromatic macrocyclic structure and electron-deficient nature.', 'Aromatic macrocycles such as cyclophanes and related structures, which are structural analogues of aromatic cages, are also known to facilitate anion-π interactions, especially when designed with electron-deficient aromatic rings.', 'Macrocyclic hosts with electron-rich cavities are generally less favorable for anion-π interactions, which prefer electron-deficient aromatic systems, often achieved through substitution with electron-withdrawing groups.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are non-covalent interactions where anions are stabilized by the quadrupole moment of electron-deficient aromatic rings. These interactions are increasingly recognized as important in supramolecular chemistry for anion recognition and binding.', 'Calixarenes are versatile macrocyclic hosts that can be functionalized to enhance specific interactions, including anion-π, by introducing electron-withdrawing groups on their aromatic units, thus creating electron-deficient π-systems.', 'Porphyrins, as macrocyclic aromatic compounds, can be modified at meso and beta positions to tune their electronic properties, making them suitable for anion-π interactions, especially when their electronic structure is made electron-deficient.', 'Aromatic macrocycles such as cyclophanes and pillararene derivatives can be engineered with electron-deficient aromatic rings, which are essential for facilitating anion-π interactions, often used in sensing and molecular recognition applications.', 'The electronic nature of the cavity (electron-rich vs. electron-deficient) is a key determinant in the binding mode; electron-deficient cavities favor anion-π interactions, whereas electron-rich cavities tend to favor cation-π or other interactions.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes, porphyrins, and aromatic macrocycles are structurally related as macrocyclic hosts with aromatic components capable of π-interactions.', 'The presence of electron-deficient aromatic rings in these hosts is a common feature that enables anion-π interactions, which are stabilized by quadrupole moments and electrostatic complementarity.', 'Functionalization with electron-withdrawing groups enhances the electron deficiency of aromatic rings, thus increasing the propensity for anion-π binding.', 'The structural features such as bowl shape in calixarenes and the macrocyclic aromatic framework in porphyrins are conducive to forming well-defined cavities that can host anions via anion-π interactions.']}
