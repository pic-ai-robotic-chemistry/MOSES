{'summary': 'Cage molecules are primarily used for guest encapsulation, molecular recognition, and catalysis, often accommodating specific molecules like indole rings, while macrocycles are employed in selective binding, sensing, and biomedical applications, with some overlapping uses such as molecular recognition and host-guest chemistry.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules can accommodate specific guest molecules such as methyl groups and indole rings, indicating their use in encapsulation and molecular recognition.', 'Macrocycles exhibit high affinity and selectivity for specific biomolecules, including amino acids and peptides, and are utilized in sensing, biomedical applications, and as components of artificial light-harvesting systems.', ' Both cage molecules and macrocycles are involved in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and sensing applications, demonstrating overlapping uses.', 'Cage molecules tend to have larger cavities and can be modified or non-modified, with cavity occupancy and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions being key features.', 'Macrocycles are characterized by their ability to bind specific targets with high affinity (nanomolar to micromolar range), and they can influence aggregation and exhibit intrinsic fluorescence.', ' Structural features such as aromaticity, cavity size, and the ability to form hydrogen bonds are critical in determining application suitability.'], 'background_information': ['Cage molecules, including molecular cages and capsules, are a class of supramolecular hosts characterized by their ability to encapsulate guest molecules within a defined cavity. They are often used in catalysis, drug delivery, and molecular recognition due to their ability to selectively bind specific molecules.', 'Macrocycles are large, ring-shaped molecules with a high degree of conformational flexibility and functionalization potential. They are widely used in host-guest chemistry, sensors, and as scaffolds in medicinal chemistry, especially for targeting biomolecules like peptides and amino acids.', ' Both cage molecules and macrocycles are integral to supramolecular chemistry, with applications spanning from environmental sensing to biomedical diagnostics. Their overlapping uses include molecular recognition, host-guest complexation, and catalysis.', 'The structural parameters such as cavity size, aromaticity, and the presence of hydrogen bonding or π-π stacking interactions are crucial in defining their application scope.', 'Cage molecules often have larger, more accessible cavities suitable for larger guests, while macrocycles tend to have more specific binding sites with high affinity and selectivity, especially for biomolecular targets.', 'Methodologically, the design of these molecules involves considerations of rigidity, preorganization, and functionalization to optimize binding affinity, selectivity, and stability.'], 'relationships': ['Both cage molecules and macrocycles are used in host-guest chemistry, with overlapping applications in molecular recognition and sensing.', 'Macrocycles can serve as platforms for artificial light-harvesting systems, similar to some cage molecules used in nanostructures.', 'Structural features such as aromatic rings and cavity dimensions influence their binding affinity and selectivity, creating a pattern where size and functionalization determine application suitability.', 'Cage molecules can be modified or non-modified, affecting their cavity occupancy and interaction types, which parallels macrocycle functionalization strategies for targeted binding.', 'Both classes can be integrated into nanostructures or sensing scaffolds, indicating their role in advanced material design and biomedical applications.']}
