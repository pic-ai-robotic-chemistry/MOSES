{'summary': 'Several macrocyclic and cavitand hosts, including calixarenes, cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and pillararenes, are known to bind anions primarily through mechanisms involving anion-π interactions, often facilitated by their aromatic and hydrophobic cavities.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes, cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and pillararenes are prominent classes of supramolecular hosts capable of anion binding.', 'Quantitative binding affinities vary, with some hosts exhibiting high affinity (e.g., nanomolar to micromolar range) for anionic guests.', 'Structural features such as aromatic cavities, hydrophobic environments, and specific functional groups (e.g., amide, phenol, cyano groups) are critical for facilitating anion-π interactions.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are non-covalent attractions between anions and electron-deficient π-systems, often stabilized by aromatic host cavities with electron-withdrawing groups.', 'Macrocyclic hosts like calixarenes and cucurbiturils are extensively studied for their ability to recognize and bind anions via multiple non-covalent interactions, including anion-π, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic forces.', 'Cavitands and cyclodextrins typically bind guests through hydrophobic effects and hydrogen bonds, but certain derivatives with aromatic or electron-deficient π-systems can engage in anion-π interactions.', 'Pillararenes, especially those with electron-deficient aromatic units, have been shown to bind anions through π-stacking and anion-π mechanisms, with selectivity influenced by cavity size and functionalization.', 'Quantitative data such as binding constants (e.g., 10^4–10^7 M^-1) and cavity dimensions (e.g., 8.7 Å diameter for pillar(7)arene) are critical for understanding binding strength and specificity.'], 'relationships': ['Many hosts, including calixarenes, cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and pillararenes, are structurally designed to optimize anion recognition.', 'The presence of aromatic units with electron-withdrawing groups enhances the potential for anion-π interactions.', 'Binding affinities correlate with cavity size, aromatic surface area, and the electronic nature of functional groups, influencing selectivity and strength of anion binding.']}
