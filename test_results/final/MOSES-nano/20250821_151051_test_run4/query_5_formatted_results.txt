{'summary': 'Current structured data does not explicitly confirm the existence of electrochemical sensors employing Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) specifically for quinine detection.', 'key_points': ['Electrochemical sensors described exhibit good reproducibility with a relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven electrodes, indicating high precision.', 'These sensors are based on nanocomposite sensing platforms and are capable of detecting targets such as tryptophan, with reasonable accuracy and high stability over 21 days.', 'The sensors are constructed using indicator displacement assays (IDA), which are known for their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and superior selectivity over interfering molecules.', 'IDAs are generally performed in live cell environments and can be coupled with differential sensing techniques, with indicators that include synthetic receptors and optical sensors.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assays (IDAs) are non-covalent, competitive binding-based sensing mechanisms widely used in optical and electrochemical sensors for various analytes, including drugs, metal cations, and biological molecules.', 'Electrochemical sensors utilizing IDA typically involve a receptor or indicator that interacts with the target analyte, causing a measurable change in electrochemical signal, such as current or potential.', 'The structured data indicates that IDA-based sensing platforms are versatile and can be integrated with nanocomposite materials like graphene or poly(N-acetylaniline) to enhance sensitivity and selectivity.', "While the data confirms the existence of IDA-based sensors with high stability, reusability, and cost-effectiveness, it does not specify whether quinine is directly detected by such sensors, although the property 'has_detection_target' includes quinine, suggesting potential applicability."], 'relationships': ['IDAs are coupled with electrochemical detection methods such as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), which are verified techniques for sensor validation.', "The sensors' high selectivity and stability imply they could be adapted for quinine detection, but explicit confirmation of quinine-specific IDA electrochemical sensors is not present in the data.", 'The use of nanocomposite materials in sensor construction suggests a trend toward enhancing detection capabilities for specific analytes like quinine, leveraging the properties of nanomaterials to improve signal transduction and specificity.']}
