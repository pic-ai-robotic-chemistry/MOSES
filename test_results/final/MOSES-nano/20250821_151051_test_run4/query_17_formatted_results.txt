{'summary': 'Cage molecules are primarily used for guest encapsulation, molecular recognition, and catalysis, while macrocycles are employed in supramolecular host systems, sensing, and biomedical applications; some overlapping uses include guest binding and molecular recognition.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules can accommodate specific guest molecules such as indole rings or methyl groups, and are characterized by their cavity occupancy and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, making them suitable for encapsulation, catalysis, and recognition.', 'Macrocycles are often used as supramolecular hosts with defined cavities, capable of binding specific targets like amino acids, peptides, or biomolecules, and are applied in sensing, light harvesting, and biomedical diagnostics.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles can form inclusion complexes, participate in guest exchange processes, and serve as platforms for multivalent systems, indicating overlapping functionalities in molecular recognition and guest encapsulation.'], 'background_information': ['Cage molecules are a class of supramolecular structures with a three-dimensional cavity capable of selectively binding guest molecules, often used in catalysis, drug delivery, and molecular recognition due to their ability to host specific guests within their cavities.', 'Macrocycles are large, ring-shaped molecules that can act as hosts in supramolecular chemistry, with applications spanning from sensing and molecular recognition to drug delivery and materials science. They often contain aromatic components and hydrogen bonding units, which facilitate selective guest binding.', 'Both classes are integral to the development of advanced functional materials in nanotechnology, sensing, and biomedical fields, with their overlapping uses primarily centered around guest binding, recognition, and complex formation.'], 'relationships': ['Cage molecules and macrocycles both serve as hosts in inclusion complexes, with macrocycles often being a subclass of cage-like structures.', 'The structural features such as cavities, aromatic components, and hydrogen bonding units are common to both, enabling similar applications in guest recognition and molecular encapsulation.', 'The ability to form hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and inclusion complexes links the functional roles of cage molecules and macrocycles, allowing them to be used interchangeably or synergistically in certain applications like sensing and targeted delivery.']}
