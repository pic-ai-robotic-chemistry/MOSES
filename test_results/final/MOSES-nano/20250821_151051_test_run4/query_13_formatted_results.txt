{'summary': 'Molecules acting as guests for supramolecular hosts are typically diverse, including organic molecules, ionic species, and biomolecules, with specific structural features such as aromatic moieties, hydrophilic or hydrophobic side groups, and functional groups that facilitate various non-covalent interactions.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules can exist in complex or free states and participate in π-π interactions, which are crucial for host-guest assembly.', 'Common guest molecules include organic compounds with aromatic moieties, ionic species like bromide, and biomolecules such as proteins or lysine residues.', 'Structural features such as benzyl groups, hydrophilic/hydrophobic side groups, and functional groups like imidazole or amino groups influence binding affinity and specificity.', 'Guest molecules often bind via hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, electrostatic interactions, and cavity filling within macrocyclic or hydrophobic hosts.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular host-guest chemistry involves non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, electrostatic forces, and van der Waals interactions. The structural diversity of guest molecules allows for tailored selectivity and binding strength.', 'Macrocyclic hosts like cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and calixarenes are common in forming inclusion complexes with guest molecules, which can be organic, ionic, or biomolecular.', 'The nature of the guest (e.g., aromaticity, polarity, charge) significantly affects the binding mode and stability of the host-guest complex. For example, aromatic moieties facilitate π-π interactions, while ionic species engage in electrostatic attractions.', 'The structural features such as hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, and functional groups determine the solubility, binding affinity, and potential applications in drug delivery, sensing, and molecular recognition.'], 'relationships': ['Guest molecules often contain aromatic moieties that enable π-π stacking interactions with host molecules.', 'Ionic species like bromide can act as counterions or guests, influencing the overall charge balance and binding dynamics.', 'Biomolecules such as proteins or amino acid residues (e.g., lysine) can serve as guests, especially in biological supramolecular systems.', 'The presence of functional groups (imidazole, amino, etc.) and side groups (hydrophilic or hydrophobic) modulates the interaction type and strength.', 'Macrocyclic hosts like cucurbiturils and cyclodextrins are common binding partners, with specific affinity for certain guest structural features, such as cavity size and polarity.']}
