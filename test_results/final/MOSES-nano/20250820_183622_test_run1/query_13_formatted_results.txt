{'summary': 'Molecules acting as guests for supramolecular hosts are typically diverse, including proteins, lysine residues, macrocyclic compounds like cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and macrocyclic host molecules, often featuring motifs such as pi-pi stacking, aromatic groups, and functional groups like imidazole.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules include proteins and amino acid residues such as lysine, which can participate in host-guest interactions.', 'Macrocyclic hosts like cucurbiturils (e.g., CB(8)), cyclodextrins, and macrocyclic host molecules are common, with specific binding motifs such as pi-pi stacking and aromatic moieties.', 'Guest molecules often contain functional groups like benzyl, imidazole, and side groups that influence binding affinity and specificity.', 'Properties such as amphiphilicity, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, and the presence of specific functional groups (e.g., benzyl, aromatic) are critical in guest-host interactions.'], 'background_information': ["Supramolecular host-guest chemistry involves non-covalent interactions where guest molecules are typically small to medium-sized organic or biological entities that fit into the host's cavity or binding site.", 'Macrocyclic compounds like cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and calixarenes are prominent classes of hosts, characterized by their cyclic structure and ability to encapsulate various guest molecules.', 'Guest molecules often exhibit specific motifs such as pi-pi stacking, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions, which are crucial for stable complex formation.', 'The structural features of guest molecules, including aromaticity, functional groups, and side chains, significantly influence their binding behavior and selectivity.'], 'relationships': ['Guest molecules are often characterized by their ability to form complexes with macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils and cyclodextrins.', 'Functional groups like imidazole and benzyl groups facilitate specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking.', 'The presence of motifs like pi-pi stacking and aromatic moieties enhances the affinity for certain hosts, especially those with hydrophobic cavities or pi-electron-rich environments.', 'Proteins and amino acid residues, especially lysine, can act as guests, indicating biological relevance and potential for bio-mimetic applications.']}
