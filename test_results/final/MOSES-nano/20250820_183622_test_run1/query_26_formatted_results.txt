{'summary': 'Cucurbiturils, calixarenes, and cavitands are known supramolecular hosts that primarily bind guests through cation-π interactions, with calixarenes notably capable of engaging in such interactions via aromatic π-systems with cationic guests.', 'key_points': ['Cucurbiturils demonstrate host-guest interactions involving electrostatic and hydrophobic forces, but are also capable of cation-π interactions, especially with aromatic or cationic guests, as indicated by their ability to form complexes with aromatic guests and their electron-rich cavities.', 'Calixarenes, particularly those with aromatic rings and hydrophobic cavities, are extensively studied for their ability to engage in cation-π interactions, especially with methylated lysines and other cationic biomolecules, facilitated by their high symmetry and bowl-shaped structures.', 'Cavitands, as rigid macrocyclic containers with aromatic or hydrophobic cavities, can also bind guests via cation-π interactions, especially when their walls contain aromatic units capable of π-electron interactions with cationic species.'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are a significant non-covalent force in supramolecular chemistry, involving the attraction between a cation and the π-electron cloud of an aromatic system. These interactions are crucial in biological recognition processes, such as neurotransmitter binding, and are exploited in the design of synthetic hosts.', 'Cucurbiturils are macrocyclic molecules with a pumpkin-shaped cavity, known for their strong binding affinity and ability to encapsulate a variety of cationic and neutral guests, often involving electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, but also capable of cation-π interactions when aromatic or positively charged guests are involved.', 'Calixarenes are cyclic oligomers with phenolic units, capable of forming host-guest complexes through multiple non-covalent interactions, including cation-π, π-π stacking, and hydrogen bonding. Their aromatic nature and bowl-shaped conformation make them particularly suitable for cation-π interactions, especially with biologically relevant cations like methylated lysines.', 'Cavitands are a class of rigid macrocyclic hosts with a cavity that can be tailored to include aromatic or hydrophobic walls, enabling binding through various non-covalent interactions, including cation-π, especially when the walls contain aromatic π-systems.'], 'relationships': ['Cucurbiturils are related to other macrocyclic hosts like calixarenes and cavitands as part of the broader family of supramolecular macrocyclic receptors.', 'Calixarenes are often functionalized with aromatic groups to enhance cation-π interactions, making them versatile in binding cationic guests such as methylated lysines.', 'Cavitands, with their aromatic or hydrophobic walls, can be designed to optimize cation-π interactions, especially in water-soluble variants used for biological applications.', 'The structural features such as cavity size, aromaticity, and functionalization influence the binding mode, with aromatic π-systems being central to cation-π interactions across these host classes.']}
