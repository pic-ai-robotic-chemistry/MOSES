{'summary': 'Aromatic macrocycles, calixarenes, and porphyrins are known supramolecular hosts that can bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions, often involving π-conjugated systems and aromatic surfaces.', 'key_points': ['Aromatic macrocycles, including cyclophanes, are structurally analogous to aromatic cages and can facilitate anion-π interactions due to their π-conjugated frameworks.', 'Calixarenes, especially calixarene derivatives, are studied extensively in supramolecular chemistry for their ability to host anions via π-systems, with ease of synthesis and functionalization enhancing their binding capabilities.', 'Porphyrins, with their extensive π-conjugated macrocyclic structure, are utilized in host-guest chemistry for anion binding, often involving π-electron-rich environments that promote anion-π interactions.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are non-covalent attractions between anions and electron-deficient π-systems, which are increasingly recognized as significant in supramolecular chemistry for anion recognition and transport.', 'Supramolecular hosts such as calixarenes, porphyrins, and macrocycles are designed with specific cavity sizes, electronic properties, and functional groups to optimize anion binding, often leveraging π-electron systems to stabilize the anion via electrostatic and dispersion forces.', 'Porphyrins and related conjugated systems are particularly effective in this context due to their delocalized π-electron clouds, which can be electron-deficient or electron-rich depending on substitution, influencing their affinity for anions through anion-π interactions.', 'The structural features such as cavity size, symmetry, and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups are critical in tuning the strength and selectivity of anion-π interactions in these hosts.'], 'relationships': ['Aromatic macrocycles, calixarenes, and porphyrins are interconnected as classes of supramolecular hosts capable of engaging in anion-π interactions.', 'π-conjugated systems and aromatic surfaces are common structural motifs that facilitate anion-π interactions across these host classes.', 'Porphyrins, calixarenes, and macrocycles often serve as platforms in host-guest chemistry, with their π-systems providing the electronic environment necessary for anion-π binding.', 'The structural analogy of aromatic macrocycles to aromatic cages underpins their ability to stabilize anions via π-interactions, which is a key principle in designing selective anion receptors.']}
