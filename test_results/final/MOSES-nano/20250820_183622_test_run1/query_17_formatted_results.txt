{'summary': 'Cage molecules primarily serve as hosts with large cavities for selective binding and encapsulation, while macrocycles are versatile supramolecular hosts involved in biomolecule recognition, guest exchange, and functional applications such as sensing and catalysis; overlaps occur in their use for molecular recognition and host-guest chemistry.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules are characterized by their large, cavity-containing structures designed for selective binding and encapsulation of multiple residues, often used in molecular encapsulation, storage, and selective separation.', 'Macrocycles are a broad class of supramolecular hosts with defined cavities, involved in biomolecule recognition, guest exchange processes, and functional applications like sensing, light harvesting, and catalysis.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles are employed in host-guest chemistry, with macrocycles like cucurbiturils, pillararenes, and cyclodextrins sharing functional overlaps with cage structures in molecular recognition and encapsulation.', 'Structural features such as aromatic rings, hydrogen bonding units, and hydrophobic cavities are common to both, facilitating similar interactions like π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding, and inclusion complex formation.'], 'background_information': ['Cage molecules, often synthesized as polyhedral structures, are used in applications requiring encapsulation of larger or multiple guest molecules, including drug delivery, molecular storage, and separation technologies.', 'Macrocycles, including cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and porphyrins, are extensively studied for their ability to form stable inclusion complexes, which are crucial in drug delivery, sensors, and catalysis.', 'The structural versatility of macrocycles allows for functionalization and tuning of cavity size and chemical environment, enabling specific recognition and binding of target molecules.', 'Both classes are integral to supramolecular chemistry, with their applications extending into nanotechnology, medicinal chemistry, and materials science.'], 'relationships': ['Cage molecules and macrocycles both function as host structures in supramolecular chemistry, facilitating molecular recognition and guest encapsulation.', 'Macrocycles can be considered a subset of cage-like structures with defined cavities, sharing similar binding mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding, π-π interactions, and hydrophobic effects.', 'Overlapping applications include biomolecule recognition, guest exchange processes, sensing, and catalysis, where both structures stabilize or selectively bind target molecules.', 'Structural features like aromatic rings and hydrogen bonding units are common to both, enabling similar interaction modes and functional versatility.']}
