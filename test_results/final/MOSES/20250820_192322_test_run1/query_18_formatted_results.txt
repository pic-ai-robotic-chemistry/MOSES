{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind anions via anion-π interactions are electron-deficient aromatic macrocycles, including certain helicarenes, macrocyclic arenes, and foldamers, as well as molecular tweezers with π-acidic surfaces.', 'key_points': ['Anion-π interactions are noncovalent forces where anions are stabilized above or below electron-deficient aromatic π-surfaces, typically in hosts with π-acidic character.', 'Key supramolecular host classes that utilize anion-π interactions include: (1) 2,6-helic[6]arene and its derivatives, (2) macrocyclic arenes such as C4A, C5A, C6A, and C8A, (3) foldamers with π-acidic surfaces, and (4) molecular tweezers designed with electron-deficient aromatic units.', 'Specific examples from the ontology include: 2,6-helic(6)arene, 2,6-helix(6)arene, C4A, C5A, C6A, C8A, and their derivatives, which are all macrocyclic hosts with extended π-surfaces suitable for anion-π binding.', 'These hosts are often designed with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, cyano, or carbonyl groups) to enhance π-acidity and thus the strength of anion-π interactions.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes, pillararenes, and resorcinarenes are also capable of anion-π binding when appropriately functionalized, but the most prominent and well-characterized examples are the helicarenes and macrocyclic arenes listed above.'], 'background_information': ["Anion-π interactions are a relatively recent addition to the supramolecular chemist's toolkit, first systematically described in the early 2000s, and are characterized by the attraction of anions to electron-deficient aromatic systems.", 'The strength of anion-π interactions depends on the π-acidity of the aromatic surface, which can be quantified by the LUMO energy or Hammett parameters of substituents; typical interaction energies range from a few to tens of kJ/mol, depending on the system and the anion involved.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as 2,6-helic[6]arene and its derivatives are notable for their rigid, preorganized π-surfaces, which facilitate selective and strong anion binding via anion-π interactions, often in competition with hydrogen bonding and electrostatic effects.', 'Foldamers and molecular tweezers can be engineered to present two or more π-acidic surfaces in a convergent geometry, maximizing the anion-π interaction and selectivity for specific anions (e.g., halides, nitrate, sulfate).', 'Anion-π recognition is of interest for applications in sensing, separation, catalysis, and the design of functional materials, as it offers orthogonal selectivity compared to traditional hydrogen bonding or electrostatic recognition modes.'], 'relationships': ['The ontology reveals that 2,6-helic(6)arene and its derivatives, as well as macrocyclic arenes (C4A, C5A, C6A, C8A), are classified both as supramolecular hosts and as anion receptors, indicating their dual functional role and relevance for anion-π binding.', 'Macrocyclic hosts with extended π-surfaces (e.g., helicarenes, macrocyclic arenes) are structurally predisposed to anion-π interactions due to their electron-deficient aromatic rings and preorganized cavities.', 'The presence of electron-withdrawing substituents on the aromatic rings is a recurring structural motif that enhances π-acidity and thus the anion-π binding capability of these hosts.', 'Foldamers and tweezers, while not always macrocyclic, can mimic the π-acidic environment of macrocycles by folding or arranging π-surfaces in a convergent fashion, thus broadening the structural diversity of anion-π hosts.', 'The overlap between the lists of supramolecular hosts and anion receptors in the ontology highlights the centrality of macrocyclic π-acidic systems in the field of anion-π recognition.']}
