{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests via cation-π interactions are calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils, all of which are aromatic macrocycles with electron-rich cavities that facilitate strong cation-π binding to positively charged guests such as alkylammonium ions and methylated lysines.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes (including calix[4]arene, calix[6]arene, calix[8]arene) are synthetic macrocyclic hosts with bowl-shaped, electron-rich aromatic cavities that bind cationic guests (e.g., methylated lysine, trimethyllysine) primarily via cation-π interactions. They exhibit high selectivity and can discriminate between methylation states (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398, 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Cyclophanes are macrocyclic hosts composed of aromatic units (e.g., xylene, ethenoanthracene) linked by aliphatic bridges, providing a rigid, electron-rich cavity for cation-π binding of alkylammonium ions and other cationic guests (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Pillararenes (e.g., pillar[5]arene, pillar[6]arene, pillar[7]arene) are macrocycles with electron-rich cavities formed by hydroquinone units, enabling selective cation-π binding of basic amino acids and methylated lysines (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398, 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'Cucurbiturils (notably CB[7] and CB[8]) are rigid, barrel-shaped macrocycles with hydrophobic, electron-rich interiors and carbonyl portals, binding cationic guests (e.g., methylated lysine, trimethyllysine, basic amino acids) via cation-π and ion-dipole interactions with high affinity (K_assoc up to 1.9 × 10^6 M^-1 for trimethyllysine; DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost, 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'All these hosts are synthetic container molecules (aromatic macrocycles) that exploit cation-π interactions as a dominant non-covalent force for molecular recognition of cationic guests, especially in aqueous or biologically relevant media.'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are non-covalent forces between a cation and the π-electron cloud of an aromatic system, critical in biological recognition (e.g., protein-ligand binding) and supramolecular chemistry.', 'Calixarenes are easily derivatized, allowing tuning of cavity size, solubility, and selectivity. They are more soluble in organic solvents but can be made water-soluble with hydrophilic modifications. Their binding affinity is generally lower than cucurbiturils but offers greater synthetic flexibility (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Cyclophanes, as structural analogues of biological aromatic cages, provide rigid, preorganized binding sites for cationic guests, mimicking natural recognition sites (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Pillararenes, with their symmetrical, electron-rich cavities, are particularly effective for binding basic amino acids and methylated lysines, and can be water-soluble or cationic depending on functionalization (DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'Cucurbiturils exhibit exceptionally high binding affinities and selectivities for cationic guests, especially methylated lysines and arginines, due to their rigid structure and carbonyl-lined portals. CB[7] and CB[8] are especially notable for their nanomolar to micromolar affinities and ability to outcompete native protein readers (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost, 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'These hosts are widely used in chemical biology, drug delivery, sensing, and as sequestration agents for biologically relevant cationic targets.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils are all aromatic macrocycles, sharing the structural feature of electron-rich cavities that enable cation-π interactions.', 'Calixarenes and pillararenes are structurally related (both are phenolic-based macrocycles), while cyclophanes are a broader class that includes calixarenes as a subfamily (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cucurbiturils, though structurally distinct (barrel-shaped with carbonyl portals), functionally overlap with calixarenes and pillararenes in their ability to bind methylated lysines and other cationic guests via cation-π interactions.', 'All these hosts are compared to biological recognition sites (e.g., aromatic cages in proteins) and can outcompete native protein readers for methylated lysine binding, especially in the case of cucurbiturils (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'The selectivity and affinity of these hosts can be modulated by cavity size, functional group derivatization, and the presence of hydrophilic or hydrophobic units, allowing fine-tuning for specific guest molecules.']}
