{'summary': 'Yes, electrochemical sensors utilizing the indicator displacement assay (IDA) have been developed for the detection of quinine, offering high selectivity, reproducibility, and stability.', 'key_points': ['Electrochemical sensors constructed using the indicator displacement assay (IDA) are capable of detecting quinine as a target analyte.', 'These sensors demonstrate superior selectivity over common interfering molecules and are cost-effective, simple, and reusable.', 'Technical performance metrics include good reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven identical electrodes), high stability (86.47% of original DPV signal retained up to 21 days at 4°C), and repeatability (five independent electrodes showed similar signals for 30 μM quinine).', 'Detection is typically verified by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and other advanced analytical techniques.', 'The sensor platforms are often based on nanocomposites, such as polyaniline decorated with silver nanoparticles, and may employ host-guest chemistry (e.g., β-cyclodextrin-quinine 1:1 molar ratio).', 'Quinine recovery rates in these systems range from 98.3% to 109.3%, indicating high analytical accuracy.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDA) are supramolecular sensing strategies where an indicator dye is displaced from a host molecule by the analyte, resulting in a measurable signal; this approach is widely used for detecting a variety of analytes, including drugs and biological molecules.', 'IDA-based sensors can be coupled with differential sensing and are applicable in complex environments, including live cells and lipid membrane constructs.', 'Electrochemical sensors are established tools for the detection of nucleotides, amino acids, and drugs, and their integration with IDA enhances specificity and sensitivity.', 'Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid with low water solubility, commonly used as an antimalarial drug and bittering agent, and is associated with adverse health effects such as thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury.', 'Sample preparation for quinine detection often involves dissolution in ethanol (stock solution: 10 mM), dilution in phosphate buffer solution (PBS), and incubation (typically 40 min).', 'The IDA approach in electrochemical sensors leverages non-covalent host-guest interactions, often using synthetic receptors (e.g., β-cyclodextrin, deep cavitands) and nanocomposite materials to achieve high selectivity and sensitivity.'], 'relationships': ['Electrochemical sensors for quinine are constructed using the IDA strategy, which involves non-covalent host-guest interactions between quinine and synthetic receptors (e.g., β-cyclodextrin).', 'The IDA mechanism enables the displacement of an indicator dye upon quinine binding, which is transduced into an electrochemical signal measured by techniques such as DPV and CV.', 'Sensor platforms are based on nanocomposites, enhancing signal stability and selectivity, and are validated using multiple analytical methods (DPV, CV, SEM, EIS, FTIR, H-NMR).', 'Quinine acts as the target analyte in these detection schemes, and its interaction with the sensor is characterized by high recovery rates and reproducibility.', 'IDA-based electrochemical sensors are part of a broader class of supramolecular and pattern-based sensing strategies, with applications extending to other drugs, amino acids, and biological molecules.']}
