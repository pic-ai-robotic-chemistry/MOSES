[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': "The query is asking which types of molecules are commonly found to act as 'guests' in supramolecular chemistry, specifically within host–guest systems. In supramolecular chemistry, 'hosts' are molecules or assemblies that can bind other molecules ('guests') through non-covalent interactions. The question seeks to identify the typical structural or chemical features of guest molecules, as well as examples of such guests, based on the most information-rich classes related to supramolecular hosts and guests.", 'hypothetical_answer': "In supramolecular chemistry, guest molecules are typically small to medium-sized entities that can be encapsulated, bound, or otherwise associated with a larger host molecule through non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, π–π stacking, or electrostatic interactions. Common types of guest molecules include: \n\n- Organic cations (e.g., ammonium ions, alkali metal ions)\n- Neutral organic molecules (e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, amines)\n- Anions (e.g., halides, nitrate, sulfate)\n- Small biomolecules (e.g., amino acids, nucleotides)\n- Gases (e.g., CO2, O2, N2)\n\nThe selection of guest molecules often depends on the size, shape, and functional groups of the host. For example, crown ethers preferentially bind alkali metal cations, cyclodextrins encapsulate hydrophobic organic molecules, and cucurbiturils can host a variety of cations and neutral guests. The key is that the guest must fit within the host's binding cavity and form favorable non-covalent interactions. The most information-rich classes related to this topic include 'supramolecular guest', 'host–guest complex', and 'non-covalent interaction'.", 'key_concepts': ['supramolecular guest', 'host–guest

Conceptual Communities Identified:\n\nA. Supramolecular Guest/Host-Guest Complex Community\n- Entities: supramolecular_guest, host-guest_complex, molecular_encapsulation\n- Coverage: Direct information on 'supramolecular_guest' is missing due to class not found errors. However, 'host-guest_complex' is well described, with multiple examples of guests (e.g., amino acids, gemini guests, nucleobases, peptides, 7-DCCAE, NBA, PMI1/2) and the nature of their association with hosts. The concept of a guest as a molecule that binds non-covalently to a host is clear, but a systematic list or typology of guest molecules is not explicitly provided.\n\nB. Non-Covalent Interaction & Molecular Recognition Community\n- Entities: non-covalent_interaction, molecular_recognition\n- Coverage: Well covered. The results provide detailed descriptions of the types of interactions (hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, ion-dipole, etc.) and the selectivity of molecular recognition, with many references to specific guest types (amino acids, peptides, proteins, methylated lysines, arginines, amines, aromatic compounds). The importance of complementarity and specificity is emphasized, and examples of recognized guests are given in the context of various hosts.\n\nC. Ion Binding Community (Cation/Anion Binding)\n- Entities: cation_binding, anion_binding\n- Coverage: 'anion_binding' is well described, with examples of anionic guests (I-, perrhenate, general anions) and the mechanisms of their binding. 'cation_binding' is missing due to class not found error, but indirect evidence from other communities (e.g., crown ethers binding ammonium cations) partially fills this gap.\n\nD. Macrocyclic Host Community (Crown Ether, Cyclodextrin, Cucurbituril)\n- Entities: crown_ether, cyclodextrin, cucurbituril\n- Coverage: Extensive. Each host type is described in terms of its structure, binding preferences, and typical guest types:\n  - Crown ethers: Bind ammonium cations, amines, metal ions, short peptides.\n  - Cyclodextrins: Bind hydrophobic molecules, n-alkanes, haloalkanes, aromatic amino acids, peptides, azobenzene, AAP derivatives.\n  - Cucurbiturils: Bind methylated lysines, arginines, amines, peptides, proteins, drugs (e.g., 5-FU), and are compared to other macrocycles.\n  - All are described as being able to bind a range of guests from metal ions, neutral molecules, organic cations, and anions.\n\n2. Missing Communities/Information Gaps:\n- Direct, systematic definition or typology of 'supramolecular_guest' is missing due to ontology errors.\n- Cation binding is not directly described, but is partially covered via crown ether and macrocycle information.\n- No explicit mention of small neutral organic molecules (e.g., alcohols, carboxylic acids, hydrocarbons) as guests, though implied by host preferences.\n- No coverage of other important host classes (e.g., calixarenes, pillarenes, molecular tweezers) that are relevant in the broader field.\n\n3. Cross-Community Relationships:\n- The macrocyclic host community bridges to the molecular recognition and non-covalent interaction communities, showing how host structure determines guest selectivity.\n- Ion binding (anion/cation) is linked to specific host types (crown ethers, cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins) and to the types of guests they bind.\n- Host-guest complex information provides concrete examples that tie together the abstract principles of molecular recognition and the specific host/guest types.\n\n4. Overall Assessment:\n- The user can infer the main types of molecules that act as guests (amino acids, peptides, proteins, cations, anions, hydrophobic molecules, aromatic compounds, drugs) and the features that make them suitable (charge, hydrophobicity, size, functional groups).\n- However, the lack of a direct, systematic list or definition of 'supramolecular_guest' and the absence of some host/guest classes means the answer is not fully comprehensive.\n- The information is sufficient for a general understanding and for providing examples, but not for an exhaustive or highly structured typology.\n\nrequirements_fulfilled: false (the answer is informative and covers most major points, but is not fully comprehensive or systematic due to missing direct definitions and some guest/host classes).", requirements_fulfilled=False), 'timestamp': '2025-08-21T16:17:16.194602', 'messages': [SystemMessage(content="Generated hypothetical document to aid in query understanding: The query is asking which types of molecules are commonly found to act as 'guests' in supramolecular...", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='fed08b88-895d-49f6-9f9f-c9361b2cc446'), SystemMessage(content='Query normalized: What types of molecules typically act as guests for supramolecular hosts?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='7382d036-8221-4d28-bc7a-d6eb0f6f6338'), SystemMessage(content='Entities refined: 21 candidate classes generated (reduction: 99.84%)', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='8ec8d4ce-2262-4a3a-ae56-8d237db93c04'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='cccd9c7e-9ccf-4959-bc00-9c94b0edd418'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='e853a3fb-c76d-44d6-9a15-fd42c18702da'), SystemMessage(content='Results validation warning: Community-guided evaluation: 1 sequential + 10 parallel', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='4c03cf8a-c62b-4cb9-a86e-3467bf929471'), SystemMessage(content='Refiner decision: retry - Generated 10 actionable hints for 11 tool calls (retry #1)', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='c850e48b-a7c5-4982-bf8a-ad75c3bbc6f6'), SystemMessage(content='Query normalized: What types of molecules typically act as guests for supramolecular hosts?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='c1e93a6d-0a10-490b-a17a-14e9228ec99d'), SystemMessage(content='Entity refinement not needed', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='04455b62-8dcf-45e7-8e87-9901c6ab74ca'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='55491cea-d52b-47a1-8c12-428ed7ff86f6'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='9cda634f-2777-44e5-9667-b3999e4b082b')]}]
