{'summary': 'There is no direct evidence in the structured data of electrochemical sensors using Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) specifically for the detection of quinine; however, related assay types and sensor components are identified, suggesting potential for such applications.', 'key_points': ['No explicit record of an electrochemical sensor employing IDA for quinine detection is present in the structured data.', 'The only descendant of indicator_displacement_assay(IDA) is fluorescent_indicator_displacement_assay (F-IDA), which is typically optical, not electrochemical.', 'Quinine is represented by its β-isomer (β_quinine) in the ontology, but no direct link to IDA-based electrochemical detection is shown.', 'Electrochemical sensor descendants include gc_electrode (glassy carbon electrode) and sensing_platform, both commonly used in electrochemical detection schemes.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular sensing strategy where an indicator is displaced from a host by the analyte, leading to a measurable signal change. While widely used in optical (especially fluorescent) detection, adaptation to electrochemical formats is less common but conceptually feasible.', 'Fluorescent Indicator Displacement Assay (F-IDA) is a well-established method for detecting small molecules, including alkaloids like quinine, but typically relies on optical readouts rather than electrochemical signals.', 'Glassy carbon electrodes (gc_electrode) are standard components in electrochemical sensors due to their wide potential window, low background currents, and chemical inertness, making them suitable for quinine detection via various electrochemical methods (e.g., voltammetry, amperometry).', 'Sensing platforms in electrochemistry often integrate recognition elements (e.g., molecularly imprinted polymers, supramolecular hosts) that could, in principle, be adapted for IDA-based detection if a suitable indicator-host system is developed for quinine.'], 'relationships': ['The ontology structure shows that F-IDA is a child of IDA, indicating that most IDA applications for quinine may currently be optical rather than electrochemical.', 'Quinine (as β_quinine) is present in the ontology, but not directly linked to any IDA or electrochemical sensor instance, suggesting a gap or an unexplored area in the structured data.', 'Electrochemical sensor components (gc_electrode, sensing_platform) are present, and could theoretically be combined with IDA principles for quinine detection, though no explicit example is given in the data.']}
