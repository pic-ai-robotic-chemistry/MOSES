{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) can detect a wide range of molecules, including small organic analytes, biomolecules, and specific post-translational modifications such as trimethylated lysine, by exploiting competitive binding interactions with a host-guest system.', 'key_points': ['IDAs are capable of detecting trimethylated lysine (DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F), caffeine, and a variety of analytes that can competitively bind to host molecules.', 'Analytes detected by IDA can include biomolecules, guest molecules, DNA, macrocyclic receptors, and specific molecular clusters (e.g., hydrated bicarbonate anion clusters).', 'Detection is based on the displacement of an indicator dye (e.g., lucigenin, dye_28, safranine T) from a host (e.g., deep cavitand, carboxylato pillar[6]arene) upon analyte binding.', 'IDAs have demonstrated selectivity for caffeine and can be applied in complex environments such as lipid membrane constructs and living cells (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Quantitative parameters such as association constants (e.g., 2.0 × 10^2) and stability of analyte-host complexes are relevant to IDA performance.'], 'background_information': ['IDAs are supramolecular sensing techniques that rely on competitive binding: an indicator dye is initially bound to a host molecule, and the presence of an analyte displaces the dye, resulting in a measurable signal change.', 'Host molecules used in IDAs include deep cavitands, calixarenes, and macrocyclic receptors, which provide selective binding sites for target analytes.', 'The method is versatile and can be adapted for detection in aqueous solutions, lipid environments, and even within living cells, expanding its utility in chemical biology and analytical chemistry.', 'Analytes can form parallel or perpendicular complexes with host molecules, and their recognition can involve specific metal centers (e.g., copper centers) or macrocyclic hosts.', 'Experimental conditions such as solvent composition (e.g., 95% water/5% deuterium oxide, pH 1) and the presence of stabilizing agents (e.g., t_rex_bead) can influence IDA performance and analyte stability.'], 'relationships': ["Trimethylated lysine and caffeine are specific examples of analytes detected by IDA, demonstrating the assay's applicability to both post-translational modifications and small molecule detection.", 'Host-guest chemistry is central: analytes compete with indicator dyes for binding to host molecules (e.g., deep cavitand, calixarene), and the displacement event is the basis for detection.', 'Indicator dyes (e.g., lucigenin, dye_28, safranine T) are chosen for their ability to provide a measurable signal upon displacement, and their interaction with the host is reversible and competitive.', 'Analytes may interact with host molecules in different conformations (parallel, perpendicular), and their association constants (e.g., 2.0 × 10^2) reflect the strength of these interactions.', 'The IDA platform is compatible with a range of molecular classes, including biomolecules, DNA, and macrocyclic receptors, highlighting its broad applicability in molecular sensing.']}
