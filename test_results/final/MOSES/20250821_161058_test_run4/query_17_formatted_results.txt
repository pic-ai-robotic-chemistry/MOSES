{'summary': 'Macrocycles and cage molecules both serve as host structures in supramolecular chemistry, with macrocycles being widely used in molecular recognition, sensing, drug delivery, and catalysis, while cage molecules are more specialized for encapsulation and selective guest binding. There is significant overlap in their use for host–guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and delivery applications, but macrocycles exhibit broader versatility and functional diversity.', 'key_points': ['Macrocycles (including macrocyclic hosts, receptors, and compounds) are extensively applied in molecular recognition, chemosensing, drug delivery, catalysis, fluorescence switching, nanotechnology, separation, and supramolecular assembly (DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663; DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).', 'Macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararene) are used for molecular delivery, separation, chemosensing, and as artificial receptors for a wide range of guests, including drugs, biomolecules, and ions (DOI:10.1002/chem.201605394).', 'Macrocyclic synthetic receptors and supramolecular assemblies are crucial in biosensing, targeted drug delivery, photodynamic therapy, and light-harvesting systems, often functioning in biological media (serum, urine, living cells).', 'Cage molecules (including molecular cages and cage-like compounds) are specialized for encapsulation, accommodating specific guests such as indole rings or methyl groups, and are characterized by p-electron-rich cavities and multiple sulfonate groups, enhancing selective binding and encapsulation.', 'Both macrocycles and cage molecules participate in host–guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and delivery of guest molecules, with macrocycles offering higher design diversity, functionalization, and broader application fields.', 'Macrocycles are generally more versatile, with well-defined, tunable cavities, high binding affinities (often nanomolar to micromolar), and are easily functionalized for specific targets (e.g., amino acids, peptides, proteins, drugs).', 'Cage molecules are less commonly used but provide unique encapsulation environments for specific guests, often with enhanced selectivity due to their three-dimensional, enclosed structures.'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles are defined by their large, ring-shaped, rigid or semi-rigid structures with a clearly defined cavity, enabling selective binding of guest molecules via noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, ion-dipole, van der Waals).', 'Macrocyclic hosts are central to supramolecular chemistry, forming inclusion complexes with a wide range of guests, and are foundational in the design of artificial receptors, sensors, and drug delivery vehicles (DOI:10.1002/chem.201605394).', 'Macrocyclic systems are highly modifiable, with functional groups (e.g., hydrophilic, cationic, peptide, saccharide) introduced at specific sites to tune solubility, selectivity, and binding affinity.', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies (e.g., cyclodextrin- or cucurbituril-based) are used for advanced applications such as bioimaging, topological morphology control, and light-harvesting energy transfer.', 'Cage molecules, in contrast, are three-dimensional, often polyhedral, structures with internal cavities that can encapsulate guests entirely, providing a unique microenvironment for chemical transformations, stabilization of reactive intermediates, or selective transport.', 'Cage-like compounds with p-electron-rich cavities and multiple sulfonate groups are particularly effective for selective guest encapsulation and can be used in separation or sensing applications.', 'Macrocycles and cages both exploit host–guest chemistry, but macrocycles are more widely used due to their synthetic accessibility, functional diversity, and broad application spectrum.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles and cage molecules both function as supramolecular hosts, but macrocycles are more versatile and widely applied, while cages are more specialized for encapsulation and selective binding.', 'Macrocyclic hosts and receptors are subtypes of macrocycles, with overlapping applications in molecular recognition, sensing, and drug delivery; macrocyclic synthetic receptors extend these uses to biosensing and therapeutic development.', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies integrate macrocyclic hosts as key components, enabling advanced functions such as targeted drug delivery and photodynamic therapy, which can overlap with the encapsulation roles of cage molecules.', 'Cage molecules can accommodate specific guests (e.g., indole rings, methyl groups), a property shared with macrocycles, but with a more enclosed, three-dimensional environment, leading to enhanced selectivity for certain applications.', 'Both classes rely on noncovalent interactions for guest binding, but macrocycles offer greater design flexibility and functionalization, while cages provide unique encapsulation environments for challenging or reactive guests.']}
