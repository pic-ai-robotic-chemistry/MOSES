{'summary': 'The primary host molecules that utilize host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays are macrocyclic compounds such as cyclodextrins (notably β-cyclodextrin and its derivatives), calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararenes, and tetrasulfonated crown ethers.', 'key_points': ['β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and its derivatives are the most widely used host molecules for host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays, forming inclusion complexes with guest molecules such as methylene blue (MB) (see DOI: 10.1007/s10847-018-0786-0).', 'Calixarenes (including calix[4]arene and its derivatives) and cucurbiturils (CB6, CB7, CB8) are also prominent host molecules, each possessing a macrocyclic cavity that enables selective guest binding.', 'Host molecules form complexes with guest molecules via non-covalent interactions, including π-π interactions, hydrogen bonding (with NH and OH groups), and charge transfer, as well as through the encapsulation of aromatic or amphiphilic guests.', 'Host-guest recognition is integrated with electrochemical sensors and assays, with the first reported integration for quinine determination using β-cyclodextrin as the host.', 'Host molecules can modulate the critical aggregation concentration of guest molecules, promote aggregation of aromatic or amphiphilic guests, and alter the chemical hardness and electron localization of the system (DOI: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest recognition is a molecular recognition process where a host molecule with a defined cavity selectively binds a guest molecule, often leading to changes in electrochemical properties that are exploited in sensor design.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and pillararenes are favored due to their well-defined, tunable cavities and ability to form stable inclusion complexes with a variety of analytes.', 'The electron localization function (ELF) analysis shows that electrons condense in the interacting regions of host-guest complexes, which can be visualized in ELF maps (DOI: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Host-guest systems are often optimized using density functional theory (DFT) to predict equilibrium geometries and binding affinities, supporting rational sensor design.', 'The formation of host-guest complexes can reduce the critical aggregation concentration of guest molecules, facilitating their detection at lower concentrations.'], 'relationships': ['Host-guest recognition is directly integrated with electrochemical sensors and assays, providing a platform for selective and sensitive analyte detection.', 'β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is specifically cited as the host in the first integration of host-guest recognition with electrochemical assays for quinine determination, with methylene blue (MB) as a model guest.', 'Host molecules interact with guest molecules through multiple mechanisms: inclusion complex formation, π-bonding, hydrogen bonding, and charge transfer, all of which can modulate the electrochemical response.', 'The macrocyclic structure of host molecules is a unifying feature that enables selective guest encapsulation and underpins their utility in electrochemical assays.', 'Host-guest interactions can influence the physicochemical properties of the system, such as aggregation behavior, electron distribution, and chemical hardness, which are critical for sensor performance.']}
