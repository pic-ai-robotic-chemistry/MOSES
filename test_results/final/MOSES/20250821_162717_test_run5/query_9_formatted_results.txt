{'summary': 'In an electrochemical sensor using an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA), quinine displaces methylene blue (MB) from the β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) host via competitive host–guest interactions, as quinine forms a more stable inclusion complex with β-CD than MB, resulting in the release of MB and a measurable electrochemical signal change.', 'key_points': ['β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) acts as a host molecule, forming 1:1 inclusion complexes with both methylene blue (MB) and quinine.', 'Methylene blue (MB) serves as the electrochemical probe (indicator) and is initially encapsulated within the β-CD cavity, producing a characteristic peak current (0.24 V) in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).', 'Upon introduction, quinine (the target analyte) competitively binds to β-CD, displacing MB due to its higher binding affinity and hydrophobicity, as both form 1:1 complexes with β-CD.', 'The displacement of MB by quinine is a non-covalent, host–guest interaction, typical of IDA mechanisms, and results in a decrease in the MB electrochemical signal, which is quantitatively correlated to quinine concentration.', 'Experimental conditions: MB and quinine are used at 10 µM and 10 mM concentrations, respectively, with 40 min incubation for complexation/displacement; β-CD concentration is also typically 10 mM.', 'The process is monitored by DPV, with the absence of MB in the β-CD cavity leading to a loss of the MB peak current, confirming successful displacement.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular analytical technique where a host–indicator complex is disrupted by an analyte, resulting in a measurable signal change (optical or electrochemical).', 'β-cyclodextrin is a cyclic oligosaccharide (7 glucopyranose units) with a hydrophobic cavity, enabling selective inclusion of hydrophobic guest molecules such as MB and quinine (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000739).', 'The host–guest recognition in β-CD is non-covalent, relying on hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals forces, and size/shape complementarity.', 'MB is a cationic dye with a strong electrochemical signal, making it a suitable probe for IDA-based electrochemical sensors; its surface density on electrodes can reach 1.18 × 10^15 molecules/cm².', 'Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid with low water solubility, commonly used as a bittering agent and antimalarial drug; its strong affinity for β-CD is due to its size, hydrophobicity, and molecular structure.', 'Electrochemical sensors based on IDA offer high selectivity, reproducibility (relative standard deviation ~2.06%), and stability (signal retention >86% over 21 days at 4°C), and are cost-effective and reusable.', 'The IDA approach is compatible with differential sensing and can be extended to detect a variety of analytes, including drugs, metal cations, and biological molecules.'], 'relationships': ['MB and quinine both form 1:1 inclusion complexes with β-CD, but quinine has a higher binding affinity, enabling it to displace MB from the β-CD cavity.', 'The displacement of MB by quinine is mediated by competitive host–guest interactions within the β-CD cavity, a hallmark of IDA.', 'The electrochemical signal (DPV peak current) is directly linked to the presence of MB in the β-CD cavity; displacement by quinine leads to a quantifiable decrease in signal.', 'The IDA sensor platform is constructed from β-CD, MB, and often nanocomposite materials (e.g., poly(N-acetylaniline), graphene) to enhance sensitivity and selectivity.', 'The method relies on non-covalent, reversible interactions, allowing for sensor reusability and adaptability to different analytes by changing the indicator or host.']}
