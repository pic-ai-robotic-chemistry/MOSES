{'summary': 'Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) can detect a wide range of molecules, including small organic compounds, amino acids, peptides, proteins, post-translationally modified residues, and various biomolecules, by exploiting competitive binding interactions in host-dye systems.', 'key_points': ['IDA detects molecules (analytes) that can competitively bind to a host-dye complex, displacing the indicator and producing a measurable signal change.', 'Specific examples of detectable molecules include: trimethylated lysine, caffeine, amino acids (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), peptides (e.g., H3 histone tail, tripeptides), proteins (e.g., insulin, myoglobin), nucleic acids (DNA, RNA), and small organic molecules (e.g., acetylcholine, glucose, cocaine).', 'IDA is applicable to a broad spectrum of chemical classes: amino acids (including methylated and unmethylated forms), peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, drugs, metabolites, and synthetic organic guests.', 'Analytes can be present in diverse environments such as aqueous solution, living cells (e.g., HeLa cells), and lipid environments, demonstrating the versatility of IDA in different matrices.', 'IDA systems utilize a variety of host molecules (e.g., calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararenes, deep cavitands) and indicators (e.g., safranine T, fluorescent dyes) to tailor selectivity and sensitivity for specific analytes.'], 'background_information': ['IDA is a supramolecular sensing technique where an indicator dye is initially bound to a host molecule; the presence of an analyte with higher affinity for the host displaces the dye, resulting in a detectable optical or fluorescent signal change.', 'The method is highly modular: by varying the host, indicator, and assay conditions, IDA can be adapted for selective detection of a wide range of targets, from small ions to large biomacromolecules.', 'IDA is particularly powerful for detecting post-translational modifications (e.g., methylation of lysine residues in histones), which are challenging to sense by other means.', 'The sensitivity and selectivity of IDA depend on the relative binding affinities of the host for the indicator and the analyte, as well as the physicochemical compatibility of the system with the sample matrix.', 'IDA has been applied in biological, environmental, and analytical chemistry for the detection of drugs (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine), neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine), metabolites, and disease biomarkers.'], 'relationships': ['Analytes are recognized by host molecules (e.g., calixarenes, cucurbiturils, deep cavitands) that form non-covalent complexes, with the analyte acting as a competitor for the binding site occupied by the indicator dye.', 'The displacement of the indicator by the analyte is the fundamental mechanism underlying the IDA signal; the strength of this displacement is governed by the relative binding constants (K_a) of the host-indicator and host-analyte complexes.', 'Analytes can interact with host molecules through various non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic effects, and π-π stacking, enabling detection of chemically diverse targets.', 'The versatility of IDA is further enhanced by the ability to operate in different environments (aqueous, cellular, lipid), making it suitable for in vitro, in vivo, and environmental applications.', 'IDA can be used to probe molecular recognition phenomena, competitive binding, and the effects of molecular modifications (e.g., methylation, acetylation) on binding affinity and selectivity.']}
