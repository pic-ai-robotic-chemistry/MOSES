{'summary': 'There is currently no direct evidence of electrochemical sensors using indicator displacement assay (IDA) specifically for quinine detection, but the structural data indicate that such a combination is technically feasible and supported by related methodologies.', 'key_points': ['No explicit record of an electrochemical sensor using IDA for quinine detection was found in the structured data.', 'Electrochemical sensors are confirmed to be used for quinine detection, with high selectivity, reproducibility (RSD 2.06% across seven electrodes), and stability (86.47% DPV signal retention over 21 days).', 'Electrochemical sensors can be constructed using IDA as a sensing strategy, and IDA is compatible with drug analytes, including quinine, as a target.', 'IDA is a non-covalent, supramolecular sensing method that can be coupled with differential sensing and is compatible with electrochemical sensor platforms (sensor conversion capability: yes).', 'Key IDA components (e.g., β-cyclodextrin, graphene, poly(N-acetylaniline)) are compatible with electrochemical sensor fabrication and have been used in related sensor systems.', 'Quinine is routinely detected by quantitative electrochemical methods, including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), and electrochemiluminescence biosensors.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are supramolecular sensing strategies where an indicator dye is displaced from a host molecule by an analyte, resulting in a measurable signal; they are widely used for detecting small molecules, post-translational modifications, and drugs.', 'IDA can be performed in live cells and is often coupled with optical or electrochemical readouts, depending on the sensor design.', 'IDA systems often use host molecules such as β-cyclodextrin, deep cavitands, or carboxylato pillararenes, and indicators such as lucigenin or safranine T.', 'Electrochemical sensors are valued for their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, reusability, and high selectivity, and are verified by techniques such as DPV, CV, EIS, SEM, FTIR, and H-NMR.', 'Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid with low water solubility, commonly dissolved in ethanol or PBS for analysis, and is used as a target analyte in various sensor platforms due to its pharmacological and toxicological significance.', 'The IDA approach is established for caffeine and trimethylated lysine detection, and the methodology is adaptable to other small molecule drugs, including quinine.'], 'relationships': ['Electrochemical sensors can be constructed using IDA, and both are compatible with drug analytes such as quinine.', 'IDA is a modular sensing strategy that can be integrated into electrochemical sensor platforms, especially when using nanocomposite materials (e.g., graphene, β-cyclodextrin) that are also suitable for quinine detection.', 'Quinine is a validated detection target for electrochemical sensors, and the IDA method is structurally and functionally compatible with the requirements for quinine sensing.', 'IDA is often coupled with differential sensing, which can enhance selectivity and sensitivity in complex matrices, a desirable feature for quinine detection in real samples.', 'The lack of direct literature evidence for IDA-based electrochemical quinine sensors may reflect a gap in published applications rather than a technical limitation, as all necessary components and methodologies are compatible.']}
