{'summary': 'Guest molecules in supramolecular host–guest systems encompass a wide range of chemical entities, including cations, anions, neutral organic molecules, and complex species such as fullerenes, with their suitability determined by size, shape, charge, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, and the presence of specific functional groups or binding motifs.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules can be cations, anions, neutral organic molecules, or larger entities like fullerenes, and are often characterized by the presence of functional groups such as imidazole, benzyl, aromatic moieties, or alkyl chains (DOI:10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'They frequently possess hydrophilic, hydrophobic, or amphiphilic side groups, which influence their solubility and binding affinity within host cavities (DOI:10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'Guest molecules may form hydrogen bonds, participate in π–π interactions, or exhibit specific binding motifs (e.g., pi-pi stacking), which are critical for molecular recognition and complex stability (DOI:10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'Complexation typically occurs with macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins), where the guest is included in a hydrophobic cavity or encapsulated within a macrocycle (DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).', 'Quantitative properties such as the number of guest molecules per host (e.g., 3 per assembly, DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398), hydration level (e.g., 3000 water molecules, DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479), and absorbance peak shifts (e.g., bathochromic shift range 400–470 nm, DOI:10.1039/D0QO00649A) are important for characterizing guest behavior.', 'Guest molecules often display improved photophysical, thermal, and aggregation stability upon complexation, and can induce changes in fluorescence or absorbance properties (DOI:10.1016/j.dyepig.2016.04.013).'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular host–guest chemistry relies on non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effects, van der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions for molecular recognition and encapsulation.', 'Macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, calixarenes) provide defined cavities that selectively bind guests based on size, shape, and chemical complementarity.', 'Guest inclusion can be cooperative (positive or negative), affecting binding stoichiometry and affinity (DOI:10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'Functional groups on guests (e.g., imidazole, benzyl, n-diethylamino) and their amphiphilicity/hydrophobicity are key determinants for selective binding and solubility in aqueous or organic media.', 'Host–guest complexes are characterized by techniques such as UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy (e.g., maximum absorbance peak at 390 nm, DOI:10.1039/D0QO00649A), titration profiles, and computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) for geometry optimization (DOI:10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Applications of host–guest systems include drug delivery, fluorescent sensors, logic gates, photofunctional materials, and stabilization of dyes (DOI:10.1016/j.dyepig.2016.04.013).'], 'relationships': ['Guest molecules are included or encapsulated within macrocyclic hosts, forming host–guest complexes stabilized by non-covalent interactions.', 'The presence of specific functional groups (e.g., aromatic, hydrophilic, hydrophobic, positively charged) on the guest determines the type and strength of interaction with the host cavity.', 'Hydrophobic guests preferentially bind to hydrophobic cavities, while hydrophilic or charged guests may require complementary host functionalities.', 'The number of guest molecules per host and the hydration level are interdependent and influence the overall stability and properties of the complex.', 'Guest binding can induce significant changes in the photophysical properties of the system, such as fluorescence enhancement or absorbance shifts, which are exploited in sensing and material applications.', 'Cooperativity (positive or negative) in guest binding affects the assembly and disassembly dynamics of host–guest systems, influencing their functional behavior in applications.']}
