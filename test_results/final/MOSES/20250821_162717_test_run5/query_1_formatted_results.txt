{'summary': 'Quinine is a naturally occurring alkaloid derived from cinchona tree bark, historically significant as an antimalarial agent and currently used for various medical and industrial applications, but associated with notable adverse health effects.', 'key_points': ['Quinine is an alkaloid component extracted from cinchona tree bark, with a quinolinium ring structure and a characteristic bitter taste.', 'It is primarily used for the treatment of malaria, but also finds application in managing lupus, arthritis, muscle cramps, and as a bittering agent in food and beverages.', 'Quinine exhibits low solubility in water and is typically dissolved or prepared in ethanol for stock solutions (commonly at 10 mM concentration) and can be diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS).', 'Analytical detection and quantification of quinine utilize advanced techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), electrochemical methods (including differential pulse voltammetry, ion transfer voltammetry, and electrochemiluminescence biosensors), colorimetric and fluorescence assays.', 'Quinine is hydrophobic, forms a 1:1 molar complex with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), and demonstrates a slight proton peak shift in NMR analysis.', 'Recovery rates in analytical procedures range from 98.3% to 109.3%, with typical incubation times of 40 minutes.', 'Adverse health effects associated with quinine include thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, blindness, and acute kidney injury.'], 'background_information': ["Quinine's historical importance lies in its role as the first effective treatment for malaria, a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted by mosquitoes.", "The compound's bitter taste is so pronounced that it is used as a standard for bitterness and as a bittering agent in tonic water and other beverages.", "Quinine's molecular structure is based on a quinoline core, which is a bicyclic aromatic system, and its pharmacological activity is linked to its ability to interfere with the parasite's heme detoxification pathway.", 'Due to its low water solubility and hydrophobic nature, quinine is often formulated with ethanol or cyclodextrins to enhance its solubility and bioavailability.', 'Electrochemical and chromatographic methods are preferred for quinine analysis due to their sensitivity and specificity, with HPLC and HRMS providing high-resolution quantification and identification.', 'The use of quinine is regulated due to its potential for severe side effects, and its use for muscle cramps has been restricted in several countries.'], 'relationships': ['Quinine is chemically classified as an alkaloid and is a natural product of cinchona tree bark.', 'Its primary medical application is as an antimalarial, but it also serves as a bittering agent and is used in the management of autoimmune and musculoskeletal disorders.', 'Analytical detection methods are closely linked to its physicochemical properties, such as hydrophobicity and low water solubility, necessitating the use of organic solvents and advanced instrumental techniques.', 'The formation of a 1:1 complex with β-cyclodextrin highlights its inclusion chemistry and potential for formulation improvements.', 'Adverse health effects are directly related to its pharmacological activity and necessitate careful monitoring in clinical and food applications.']}
