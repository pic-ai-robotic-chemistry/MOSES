{'summary': 'A cryptand is a macrobicyclic ligand that acts as a molecular host, capable of encapsulating guest species—especially ions or small molecules—within its three-dimensional cavity, and is notable for its selectivity and utility in host-guest and supramolecular chemistry.', 'key_points': ['Cryptands are a class of macrobicyclic ligands, meaning they possess two or more interconnected macrocyclic rings, forming a three-dimensional, cage-like structure (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'They function as molecular hosts, encapsulating guest species (notably organic guests and ions) within their internal cavity, a property central to host-guest chemistry.', 'Cryptands can be functionalized with specific dyes, such as anthracene or naphthalimide, to enhance selectivity for particular anions (e.g., sulfate).', 'They are classified as receptors, especially when functionalized to recognize and bind specific ions or molecules.', 'The encapsulation ability of cryptands is a result of their rigid, preorganized structure, which leads to high binding affinities and selectivities (macrocyclic effect).'], 'background_information': ['Cryptands are pivotal in supramolecular chemistry, where they serve as prototypical hosts in the study of non-covalent interactions and molecular recognition.', "The term 'cryptand' was introduced by Jean-Marie Lehn, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1987 for his work on supramolecular chemistry and cryptate complexes.", 'Cryptands are structurally related to crown ethers but offer a three-dimensional cavity, resulting in greater selectivity and binding strength for guest species.', 'Their ability to encapsulate ions makes cryptands valuable as phase-transfer agents, facilitating the transport of ions across immiscible phases.', 'The formation of a cryptate (a complex of a cryptand with a guest ion) is a key example of the macrocyclic effect, where preorganized macrocyclic hosts exhibit enhanced binding compared to their acyclic analogs.'], 'relationships': ['Cryptands are a subclass of macrobicyclic ligands and receptors, reflecting their dual role as structural frameworks and functional molecular hosts (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'They form host-guest complexes with organic guests and ions, a central concept in supramolecular and host-guest chemistry.', 'Functionalization with anthracene or naphthalimide dyes modulates their selectivity, particularly for anions such as sulfate.', 'The encapsulation of guest species by cryptands leads to the formation of cryptates, which are stabilized by non-covalent interactions within the cryptand cavity.', 'Cryptands exemplify the macrocyclic effect, where the preorganized, rigid structure of the host leads to high affinity and selectivity for guest binding.']}
