{'summary': 'Several types of host-guest interactions—including electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interactions, and metal coordination—can be exploited to design indicator displacement assays (IDAs) with optical detection, with electrostatic interactions being particularly well-characterized and versatile in supramolecular systems.', 'key_points': ['Electrostatic interactions are a primary and versatile force for host-guest binding in IDAs, especially between charged groups such as cationic hosts and anionic guests (e.g., lysine residues and sulfonate groups) (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'Electrostatic interactions are non-covalent, highly sensitive to environmental conditions, and can be a driving force for guest localization within host cavities (DOI:10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004; DOI:10.1002/chem.201605394).', 'Other relevant host-guest interactions for IDA design include hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interactions, and metal coordination, each contributing to molecular recognition and optical signal modulation.', 'Electrostatic interactions can occur at specific structural motifs, such as carbonyl portals in macrocyclic hosts, and are often evaluated using computational methods like DFT calculations (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925; DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'The strength and selectivity of electrostatic interactions can be modulated by the nature of the host and guest, as well as by environmental factors such as solvent polarity and ionic strength.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are a class of supramolecular sensing techniques where a reporter (indicator) is displaced from a host by an analyte, leading to a measurable optical signal change.', 'Host-guest recognition in IDAs relies on non-covalent supramolecular interactions, which are reversible and tunable, making them ideal for sensing applications.', 'Electrostatic interactions are a subclass of supramolecular interactions and intermolecular forces, often dominating in aqueous environments where charged species are prevalent (DOI:10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004).', 'Hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking are also critical in IDA design, especially for neutral or aromatic analytes, while hydrophobic interactions can enhance selectivity and binding in less polar environments.', 'The selectivity and sensitivity of IDAs can be fine-tuned by choosing appropriate host-guest pairs and optimizing the balance of different non-covalent interactions.', 'Computational methods, such as DFT calculations, are frequently used to evaluate and predict the strength and geometry of host-guest interactions in IDA systems (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).'], 'relationships': ['Electrostatic interactions are a type of supramolecular and intermolecular force, often acting in concert with hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic interactions to stabilize host-guest complexes (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'Electrostatic interactions can be highly sensitive to environmental changes, such as solvent composition and ionic strength, which can either enhance or overwhelm their contribution to binding (DOI:10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004; DOI:10.1039/D0QO00649A).', 'Specific structural motifs, such as carbonyl portals in macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils, calixarenes), provide defined sites for electrostatic interaction with guest molecules, influencing both affinity and selectivity.', 'Electrostatic interactions often occur between functional groups such as lysine residues and sulfonate groups, or between cationic and anionic species, and can be modulated by the presence of other non-covalent forces (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'The interplay between different types of non-covalent interactions (electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic) is crucial for the design of effective and selective IDAs with optical readouts.']}
