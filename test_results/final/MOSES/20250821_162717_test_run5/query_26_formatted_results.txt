{'summary': 'The primary classes of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests via cation-π interactions are calixarenes (including calix[4]arene, calix[6]arene, and their derivatives), cyclophanes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils, all of which feature aromatic cavities that facilitate strong cation-π binding.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes (e.g., calix[4]arene, calix[6]arene, calix[8]arene) and their derivatives are prominent supramolecular hosts that utilize cation-π interactions for guest binding, especially for methylated amino acids such as trimethyllysine.', 'Cyclophanes, including triamine and monoamine derivatives, as well as disulfide and tetracationic cyclophane derivatives, are engineered to present aromatic surfaces for cation-π recognition of cationic guests.', 'Pillararenes (e.g., pillar[5]arene, pillar[6]arene, pillar[7]arene) and their functionalized forms (anionic, cationic, water-soluble) provide rigid, electron-rich aromatic cavities that bind cationic species via cation-π interactions.', 'Cucurbiturils (e.g., CB[6], CB[7], CB[8]) are macrocyclic hosts with hydrophobic, π-rich portals that strongly bind cationic guests, including methylated lysines, through cation-π and ion-dipole interactions.', 'These hosts are designed to discriminate between methylation states of amino acids, with strong binding affinity for methylated targets (e.g., trimethyllysine) and weaker affinity for unmethylated analogs, often sufficient to outcompete native reader proteins (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are noncovalent forces between a cationic guest and the π-electron cloud of an aromatic system, critical for molecular recognition in both biological and synthetic systems.', "Supramolecular hosts that exploit cation-π interactions are often inspired by natural protein 'reader' domains that recognize post-translationally methylated lysine or arginine residues.", 'These hosts are typically designed for high selectivity and affinity in biologically relevant solvents (e.g., warm, salty water), enabling applications in chemical biology and biochemistry, such as in vivo sequestration of methylated biomolecules.', 'The interaction surface area of these synthetic hosts is generally smaller than that of protein counterparts, but their selectivity for methylation state can be engineered to be highly specific.', 'Host-guest systems based on cation-π interactions are used to create pan-specific reagents for the detection, sequestration, or modulation of methylated amino acids, peptides, and proteins.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils all share the structural feature of an aromatic cavity or wall, which is essential for cation-π binding.', "These hosts are compared to natural protein 'reader' domains, with the synthetic hosts often designed to outcompete native proteins for binding to methylated targets.", 'The selectivity for methylation state is a key design criterion, with hosts able to discriminate between methylated and unmethylated amino acids, peptides, or proteins.', 'There is a competitive relationship between synthetic supramolecular hosts and native reader proteins for binding to post-translationally modified biomolecules, relevant for applications in chemical biology and biochemistry.', 'The design and function of these hosts are inspired by nature but are created via de novo design to achieve desired selectivity, affinity, and solvent compatibility.']}
