{'summary': 'Several classes of supramolecular hosts, including macrocycles, aromatic cages, calixarenes, cyclophanes, molecular tweezers, foldamers, pyridinium, and viologen derivatives, are known to bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions, leveraging electron-deficient aromatic surfaces to stabilize anionic guests.', 'key_points': ['Supramolecular hosts that bind anions via anion-π interactions include macrocycles, aromatic cages, calixarenes, cyclophanes, molecular tweezers, foldamers, pyridinium, and viologen-based systems.', 'Anion-π interactions involve the stabilization of anions by electron-deficient aromatic π-systems, which are engineered into the host structure to maximize binding affinity and selectivity for anionic guests.', 'These hosts are designed to exploit weak, noncovalent interactions, particularly anion-π, as the primary mode of guest recognition, often in competition with other interactions such as hydrogen bonding or ion pairing.', 'Quantitative assessment of anion binding is typically performed using NMR titration experiments and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), providing binding constants and thermodynamic parameters.', 'The effectiveness of anion-π binding is influenced by the solvation shell and hydration energy of the anion, as well as the electron-deficiency and geometry of the aromatic surface.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts are synthetic molecules engineered to recognize and bind specific guests, such as anions, through noncovalent interactions, mimicking biological recognition processes.', 'Anion-π interactions are a relatively recent addition to the repertoire of supramolecular chemistry, relying on the attraction between anions and electron-deficient aromatic rings, in contrast to the more common cation-π interactions.', 'The design of anion-π hosts often involves incorporating electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, cyano, or pyridinium groups) onto aromatic frameworks to enhance π-acidity and thus anion affinity.', 'Macrocycles and related hosts can be tailored for selectivity and affinity by varying ring size, substituent pattern, and preorganization of the binding site.', 'Anion binding is strongly affected by the hydration shell of the anion; hosts must compete with solvation, and thus binding is often more effective for less hydrated (more weakly solvated) anions, as reflected in the Hofmeister series.', 'Applications of anion-π hosts include sensing, separation, catalysis, and biological recognition, particularly in physiologically relevant media.'], 'relationships': ['Supramolecular hosts are functionally analogous to biological proteins in their ability to selectively bind targets, but are synthetically tunable for specific anion recognition via anion-π interactions.', "Anion-π binding competes with other noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, Coulombic) and is modulated by the solvation environment and the host's electronic properties.", "The selectivity and affinity of anion-π hosts are influenced by the interplay between the host's π-acidity, the anion's hydration energy, and the competitive effects of solvation and other binding modes.", 'Macrocycles, calixarenes, cyclophanes, and related hosts can be compared and contrasted based on their structural preorganization, electronic properties, and resulting anion-π binding capabilities.']}
