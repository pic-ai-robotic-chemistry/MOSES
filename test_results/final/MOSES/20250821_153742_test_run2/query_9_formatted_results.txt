{'summary': 'Quinine displaces methylene blue (MB) from the β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) cavity in an electrochemical sensor using an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) by forming a more stable host-guest inclusion complex with β-CD, thereby releasing MB into solution and altering the electrochemical signal.', 'key_points': ['β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) acts as a host molecule with a hydrophobic cavity capable of forming 1:1 inclusion complexes with both MB and quinine, as indicated by their molar ratios (1:1 with β-CD).', 'Methylene blue (MB) initially occupies the β-CD cavity via non-covalent host-guest interactions, serving as the electrochemical probe (10 µM MB, 10 mM β-CD).', 'Quinine, being more hydrophobic and having a higher binding affinity for β-CD than MB, competitively displaces MB from the β-CD cavity when introduced (incubation time: 40 min).', 'The displacement is evidenced by a change in the electrochemical signal (peak current at 0.24 V for MB), as MB is released from the β-CD cavity and becomes electrochemically active in solution.', 'The process is non-covalent and reversible, relying on the relative affinities of MB and quinine for the β-CD host, and is monitored by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).'], 'background_information': ['β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a cyclic oligosaccharide composed of seven glucopyranose units, forming a hydrophobic cavity that can encapsulate small hydrophobic molecules via host-guest chemistry (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000739).', 'Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular analytical technique where an indicator (here, MB) is displaced from a host (β-CD) by an analyte (quinine), resulting in a measurable signal change (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'MB is a cationic dye and redox probe with a surface density of 1.18 × 10^15 molecules/cm² on the electrode, and its electrochemical signal is used to monitor displacement events.', 'Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid with low water solubility, favoring its inclusion in the β-CD cavity over MB due to stronger hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions.', 'The sensor platform is based on nanocomposite-modified electrodes (e.g., β-CD/poly(N-acetylaniline)/graphene), providing high selectivity, reproducibility (RSD 2.06%), and stability (86.47% signal retention over 21 days).', 'The IDA approach is compatible with differential sensing arrays, allowing multiplexed detection by combining multiple hosts and indicators.'], 'relationships': ["MB and quinine both form 1:1 inclusion complexes with β-CD, but quinine's higher hydrophobicity and affinity enable it to outcompete MB for the β-CD binding site.", 'The displacement of MB by quinine is a competitive host-guest exchange, directly affecting the electrochemical signal used for quantification.', 'The IDA mechanism is non-covalent and reversible, allowing for sensor reusability and dynamic response to analyte concentration.', "The electrochemical sensor's performance (selectivity, reproducibility, stability) is enhanced by the supramolecular host-guest chemistry and the nanocomposite electrode platform.", 'The use of DPV enables sensitive detection of MB displacement, correlating the signal change to quinine concentration in the sample.']}
