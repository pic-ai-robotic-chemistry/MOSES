{'summary': 'Macrocyclic supramolecular hosts—particularly calixarenes, resorcinarenes, cyclophanes, and triazine-based hosts—are known to bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions, leveraging electron-deficient aromatic surfaces within their cavities.', 'key_points': ['Macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes (including calix[4]arene, calix[6]arene, calix[8]arene), resorcinarenes, cyclophanes, pillararene, and triazine-based hosts are established supramolecular hosts for anion-π binding.', 'These hosts possess hydrophobic or nano-sized cavities lined with electron-deficient aromatic rings, which facilitate anion-π interactions by stabilizing anionic guests via non-covalent forces.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are often designed with high symmetry and specific functional groups (e.g., ammonium, carboxylate, charged moieties) to enhance selectivity and binding affinity for anions.', 'Anion-π interactions are a subset of weak non-covalent interactions, and the binding affinity can be tuned by modifying the electronic properties of the aromatic surfaces within the host cavity.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions involve the attraction between an anion and the π-system of an electron-deficient aromatic ring, a phenomenon increasingly exploited in supramolecular chemistry for selective anion recognition.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are a central class in supramolecular chemistry, offering preorganized, rigid frameworks that can encapsulate guest species through host-guest chemistry, including anion-π, hydrogen bonding, and other non-covalent interactions.', 'Calixarenes and their derivatives are particularly versatile due to their tunable cavity size and functionalization, allowing for selective recognition of various anions in both organic and aqueous media.', 'Triazine-based hosts and pillararene derivatives have emerged as newer platforms for anion-π recognition, often featuring enhanced electron-deficient aromatic surfaces for stronger anion binding.', 'Applications of these hosts include chemosensing, catalysis, molecular recognition, drug delivery, and nanotechnology, where selective anion binding is critical.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocyclic hosts (calixarenes, resorcinarenes, cyclophanes, pillararene, triazine-based hosts) are subtypes of macrocyclic receptors and are all artificial receptors developed within supramolecular chemistry for host-guest interactions.', 'The presence of hydrophobic or nano-cavities lined with electron-deficient aromatic rings is a unifying structural feature that enables anion-π binding across these host classes.', 'Functional group modification (e.g., addition of charged moieties) on the macrocyclic scaffold can modulate selectivity and affinity for specific anions, demonstrating a structure–function relationship.', 'These hosts are used in the design of supramolecular assemblies and have applications in biologically relevant work, catalysis, chemosensing, and molecular delivery, highlighting their multifunctional role in advanced chemical systems.']}
