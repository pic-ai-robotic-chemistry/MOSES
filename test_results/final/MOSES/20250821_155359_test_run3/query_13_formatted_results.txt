{'summary': 'A wide variety of molecules can act as guests in supramolecular host–guest systems, including neutral, cationic, anionic, aromatic, hydrophobic, amphiphilic, and biomolecular species, with selection governed by the host’s cavity size, shape, and interaction preferences.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules encompass a broad spectrum of chemical types: neutral organic molecules (e.g., alkanes, alcohols, aromatic compounds), cationic guests (e.g., quaternary ammonium salts, bipyridinium salts), anionic guests, amphiphilic molecules, peptides, dyes, and small biomolecules.', 'Aromatic guests (e.g., benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, porphyrins) are common due to π–π stacking and hydrophobic interactions with hosts such as cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, and calixarenes.', 'Hydrophobic guests (e.g., alkanes, cycloalkanes, decalin, dodecane) are frequently encapsulated by hosts with hydrophobic cavities, driven by the hydrophobic effect in aqueous environments.', 'Charged guests (cationic and anionic) interact with hosts via electrostatic, ion–dipole, and hydrogen bonding interactions; examples include bipyridinium salts, ammonium ions, and sulfonated dyes.', 'Amphiphilic guest molecules, such as certain peptides and surfactants, can be selectively recognized by hosts with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic binding sites.', 'Biomolecular guests include amino acids (e.g., lysine, arginine, phenylalanine), peptides, and nucleic acid derivatives, enabling applications in sensing and biorecognition.', 'Fluorescent dyes and chromophores (e.g., rhodamine, fluorescein, coumarin derivatives) are often used as guests for optical sensing and reporting functions in supramolecular systems.'], 'background_information': ['Host–guest chemistry is a central theme in supramolecular chemistry, relying on non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic effects, and electrostatic interactions for molecular recognition.', 'The structural diversity of guest molecules reflects the versatility of supramolecular hosts, which include macrocycles (cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes), molecular cages, and metal–organic frameworks.', 'Guest selection is influenced by the size, shape, and functional group complementarity between host and guest, as well as solvent environment and competitive binding effects.', 'Host–guest complexes are foundational in applications such as molecular sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, and materials science, where selective encapsulation or recognition of specific guests is critical.', 'The inclusion of biomolecules as guests enables the design of supramolecular systems for biomedical applications, including targeted delivery, diagnostics, and molecular imaging.', 'The use of fluorescent and chromophoric guests allows for real-time monitoring of host–guest interactions and the development of responsive supramolecular materials.'], 'relationships': ['Guest molecules are classified by charge (cationic, anionic, neutral), hydrophobicity, aromaticity, and amphiphilicity, reflecting the diversity of non-covalent interactions exploited in host–guest systems.', 'Aromatic and hydrophobic guests often overlap, as many aromatic compounds are also hydrophobic, leading to strong binding in hydrophobic host cavities.', 'Charged guests (e.g., bipyridinium salts, ammonium ions) are preferentially bound by hosts with complementary charge or polarizable binding sites, demonstrating the importance of electrostatic complementarity.', 'Peptides and amino acids as guests highlight the intersection of supramolecular chemistry with biochemistry, enabling selective recognition based on sequence and side-chain functionality.', 'Fluorescent and chromophoric guests serve dual roles as both analytes and reporters, linking host–guest binding events to optical signals for sensing applications.']}
