{'summary': 'Cage molecules and macrocycles are both key classes of supramolecular hosts with overlapping and distinct applications, particularly in encapsulation, molecular recognition, catalysis, and drug delivery, but differ in their structural features and the scope of their host-guest chemistry.', 'key_points': ['Macrocycles (e.g., cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararenes) are widely used as host molecules for molecular recognition, drug delivery, catalysis, chemosensing, and supramolecular assembly due to their defined cavities and tunable functionalization.', 'Cage molecules (molecular cages) are three-dimensional, often polyhedral structures capable of encapsulating guest molecules, with applications in selective encapsulation, gas storage, molecular separation, and catalysis.', 'Both macrocycles and cages participate in host-guest chemistry, forming inclusion complexes and enabling molecular encapsulation, but cages typically offer a more enclosed environment, enhancing selectivity and protection of guests.', 'Macrocycles are integral to the design of artificial light-harvesting systems, supramolecular dye lasers, and as platforms for multivalent interactions, while cages are more specialized for encapsulation-driven applications such as gas storage and co-encapsulation of multiple guests.', 'Overlapping uses include drug delivery (as carriers or protective hosts), catalysis (as nanoreactors or enzyme mimics), and molecular recognition (for sensing or separation), with the choice between macrocycle and cage often dictated by the size, shape, and chemical nature of the target guest.'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles are typically planar or cyclic molecules with a central cavity, allowing for selective binding of ions, small molecules, or biomolecules via noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic effects.', 'Cage molecules, including coordination cages and organic cages, provide a three-dimensional, often rigid, cavity that can completely surround a guest, offering enhanced protection from the external environment and unique selectivity based on size and shape complementarity.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are highly modular, with subtypes such as calixarenes, cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and pillararenes, each offering distinct cavity sizes, chemical environments, and functionalization options for tailored applications.', 'Encapsulation by both macrocycles and cages can modulate guest properties, such as fluorescence intensity, stability, and reactivity, and is often studied using techniques like NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', 'Macrocycles are foundational in supramolecular chemistry, contributing to the development of molecular machines, sensors, and responsive materials, while cages are increasingly used in advanced applications such as gas storage, molecular separations, and as nanoreactors for confined-space catalysis.', 'Host-guest complexation is a central theme, with macrocycles often forming 1:1 or higher-order complexes, and cages enabling co-encapsulation or selective guest sorting based on cavity architecture.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles and cages are both supramolecular hosts, but macrocycles are generally two-dimensional (cyclic) while cages are three-dimensional (polyhedral or closed-shell).', 'Both classes are involved in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and encapsulation, but cages provide a more enclosed environment, leading to enhanced selectivity and protection of guests.', 'Macrocycles are more versatile in terms of functionalization and integration into larger supramolecular assemblies, while cages excel in applications requiring complete guest encapsulation, such as gas storage and molecular separation.', 'The choice between macrocycle and cage for a given application depends on the required cavity size, guest selectivity, and the degree of protection or isolation needed for the guest molecule.', 'Macrocyclic and cage-based systems both contribute to the fields of catalysis, drug delivery, and sensing, with overlapping but distinct advantages based on their structural and chemical properties.']}
