{'summary': 'Several classes of supramolecular hosts, including calixarenes, cyclophanes, cucurbiturils, crown ethers, and pillararenes, are known to bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions, leveraging their electron-rich aromatic cavities to selectively accommodate cationic species.', 'key_points': ['Supramolecular hosts such as calixarenes, cyclophanes, cucurbiturils, crown ethers, and pillararenes are specifically designed to exploit cation-π interactions for guest binding.', 'These hosts possess electron-rich aromatic surfaces or cavities that facilitate strong, non-covalent interactions with cationic guests, such as methylated amino acids (e.g., trimethyllysine).', 'Cation-π interactions are a type of weak interaction, but when properly engineered in host structures, they can confer high selectivity and significant binding affinity for specific cationic targets.', 'Supramolecular hosts are often created via de novo design to target post-translationally methylated partners, such as methylated peptides and proteins, and can discriminate between different methylation states.'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are non-covalent forces between a cation and the π-electron cloud of an aromatic system, playing a crucial role in molecular recognition and host-guest chemistry.', 'The selectivity of supramolecular hosts for cationic guests is critical in applications such as biochemistry and chemical biology, where discrimination between methylation states of biomolecules is essential.', 'These hosts are used as sequestration agents and can function in physiologically relevant media, making them valuable tools for studying or modulating biological processes.', 'Supramolecular hosts are compared to native reader proteins in their ability to recognize and bind post-translationally modified biomolecules, and they may compete with these proteins for binding sites.', 'Applications extend to the creation of pan-specific reagents and the study of host-guest chemistry in various solvents.'], 'relationships': ['Supramolecular hosts are engineered to have high selectivity for cationic guests, particularly those with post-translational methylation, by leveraging cation-π interactions.', 'There is a direct relationship between the structural features of these hosts (aromaticity, cavity size, electron density) and their binding affinity/selectivity for specific cationic targets.', 'These hosts can compete with native reader proteins for binding to methylated biomolecules, highlighting their potential as biochemical tools or probes.', 'The ability to discriminate between different methylation states is linked to the fine-tuning of cation-π interaction strength within the host structure.']}
