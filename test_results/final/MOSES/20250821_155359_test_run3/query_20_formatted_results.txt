{'summary': 'Non-covalent interactions, particularly hydrogen bonds and anion-π interactions, are fundamental to the formation, selectivity, and stability of supramolecular host-guest complexes by mediating molecular recognition and driving the assembly of host and guest molecules through specific, directional, and tunable forces.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonds are among the strongest and most influential non-covalent interactions in host-guest complex formation, with typical bond distances ranging from 2.1 Å to ~3.0 Å and average bond energies around 23.8 kJ/mol (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000739).', 'Hydrogen bonding is critical for molecular recognition, selectivity, and stabilization of host-guest complexes, especially in organic media or amphiphilic environments; its effectiveness is attenuated in water due to competition with solvent molecules (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Anion-π interactions, a subclass of noncovalent interactions, facilitate anion coordination and are exploited in anion sensing and selective binding by triazine-based and other aromatic hosts (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding, anion-π, CH-π, π-π, hydrophobic, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions, act cooperatively to drive the formation and stabilization of supramolecular host-guest complexes (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'Host-guest complex formation is typically driven by a combination of electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and π-system interactions, with selectivity and binding affinity modulated by the nature and arrangement of these forces (DOI: 10.1016/j.tca.2017.08.009).', 'Binding selectivity in host-guest systems is strongly influenced by hydrogen bonds, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions, with the highest selectivity values observed for specific guest-host pairs (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'The stoichiometry of many supramolecular host-guest complexes is 1:1, with binding constants often in the range of 10^4–10^6 M^-1, and stability can be further modulated by pH, association constants, and the presence of specific functional groups (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular host-guest complexes are non-covalent assemblies formed between a host (e.g., macrocycle like CB7 or CB8) and a guest (e.g., dye, amino acid, or small molecule), often in aqueous solution, leading to changes in guest properties such as fluorescence, solubility, and reactivity (DOI: 10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107919).', 'Molecular recognition in supramolecular chemistry is governed by weak, reversible interactions, with hydrogen bonds and π-system interactions providing directionality and specificity, while hydrophobic and van der Waals forces contribute to overall stabilization (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Hydrogen bonding is especially relevant for selectivity in molecular recognition, as it can discriminate between guests based on donor-acceptor complementarity and spatial arrangement (DOI: 10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004).', 'Anion-π interactions are increasingly recognized for their role in anion binding and sensing, particularly in systems where traditional hydrogen bonding is less effective or where anion selectivity is desired (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'The effectiveness of non-covalent interactions can be modulated by solvent, pH, and the presence of competing species; for example, hydrogen bonds are weakened in high-energy water environments, while hydrophobic effects are enhanced (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Host-guest complex formation and stability are commonly characterized by techniques such as NMR, UV-Vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and X-ray crystallography, which provide quantitative data on binding constants, stoichiometry, and structural details (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).', 'True specificity in supramolecular host-guest systems is challenging to achieve due to the subtle balance of multiple weak interactions, but selectivity can be enhanced by preorganization, cavity size, and functional group placement (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).'], 'relationships': ['Hydrogen bonds and anion-π interactions are both subtypes of non-covalent interactions and often act cooperatively with other forces (e.g., hydrophobic, electrostatic, π-π) to stabilize host-guest complexes.', 'The selectivity and stability of host-guest complexes are emergent properties resulting from the interplay of multiple non-covalent interactions, with hydrogen bonds providing directionality and anion-π interactions enabling selective anion binding.', 'The presence and strength of hydrogen bonds are modulated by solvent environment (stronger in organic media, weaker in water), while anion-π interactions are particularly effective in aromatic, electron-deficient host systems.', 'Host-guest complex formation is a process driven by the sum of non-covalent interactions, and the resulting complexes can be tuned for specific applications (e.g., sensing, drug delivery) by modifying the host or guest to favor certain interactions.', 'Molecular recognition, the underlying process for host-guest complexation, is governed by weak interactions and is central to supramolecular chemistry, with hydrogen bonds and π-system interactions being key contributors to specificity and affinity.', 'Experimental and computational methods (e.g., NMR, ITC, X-ray, DFT) are used to dissect the contributions of individual non-covalent interactions to the overall binding thermodynamics and structure of host-guest complexes.']}
