{'summary': 'There is currently no direct evidence of electrochemical sensors using indicator displacement assay (IDA) specifically for quinine detection, but the structural data indicate that such a combination is feasible and supported by related methodologies and components.', 'key_points': ['No explicit record of an electrochemical sensor using IDA for quinine detection was found in the structured data.', 'Electrochemical sensors are confirmed to detect quinine using various techniques, including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), electrochemiluminescence biosensors, and ion transfer voltammetry (ITV).', "Electrochemical sensors can be constructed using IDA principles and have been applied to detect other analytes (e.g., tryptophan), demonstrating the platform's versatility.", 'IDA is a general assay format for detecting drugs, metal cations, anions, and biological molecules, and can be coupled with electrochemical sensor platforms.', 'Calixarenes, a class of supramolecular hosts, are widely used in sensor applications (including drug detection) and possess properties (host-guest chemistry, high selectivity, ease of derivatization) that make them suitable for IDA-based electrochemical sensors.', 'Quinine is routinely detected by electrochemical techniques, with reported high recovery rates (98.3% to 109.3%) and good reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven electrodes).'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDA) operate on the principle of competitive binding, where an analyte displaces a pre-bound indicator from a host molecule, resulting in a measurable signal change.', 'IDA is commonly used with optical sensors but is structurally compatible with electrochemical sensor platforms, especially when using synthetic receptors such as calixarenes or cyclodextrins.', 'Calixarenes are macrocyclic compounds with a hydrophobic cavity, capable of selective host-guest interactions with a variety of drugs and biomolecules, and are easily derivatized for sensor applications.', 'Electrochemical sensors offer advantages such as high sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, reusability, and cost-effectiveness, and are validated by techniques like DPV, CV, EIS, FTIR, H-NMR, and SEM.', 'Quinine, an alkaloid from cinchona bark, is hydrophobic and has low water solubility, but can be analyzed in phosphate buffer or ethanol; it is a target for drug monitoring due to its therapeutic and toxicological relevance.', 'Calixarene-based sensors have been successfully applied to detect structurally similar amine drugs and other pharmaceuticals, supporting the plausibility of their use in quinine detection via IDA.'], 'relationships': ['Electrochemical sensors can be constructed using IDA, and both platforms share compatibility with supramolecular hosts like calixarenes and cyclodextrins.', 'Calixarenes serve as synthetic receptors in both IDA and electrochemical sensor formats, enabling selective recognition of drug molecules through host-guest chemistry.', 'Quinine is a validated target for electrochemical detection, and the use of supramolecular hosts (e.g., calixarenes) in IDA-based sensors for other drugs suggests a transferable methodology.', 'IDA is not limited to optical outputs; its core mechanism (competitive binding and displacement) can be transduced electrochemically, especially with appropriate indicator and host selection.', 'The high selectivity and modularity of calixarene hosts, combined with the sensitivity of electrochemical detection, create a strong foundation for developing IDA-based electrochemical sensors for quinine, even if not yet explicitly reported.']}
