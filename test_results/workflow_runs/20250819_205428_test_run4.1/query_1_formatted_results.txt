{'summary': 'Yes, electrochemical sensors using the Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) have been developed for the detection of quinine. These sensors typically employ supramolecular host-guest chemistry, such as calixarene or cyclodextrin-based systems, and demonstrate high selectivity, reproducibility, and stability for quinine detection.', 'key_points': [{'Electrochemical Sensor Construction and Performance': ['Electrochemical sensors can be constructed using the Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) approach (is_constructed_by: IDA).', 'Such sensors have been specifically developed for quinine detection (has_detection_target: quinine).', 'These sensors are often based on nanocomposite materials, such as polyaniline decorated with silver nanoparticles or graphene, which enhance sensor performance (is_based_on: nanocomposite) [10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4].', 'Sensors exhibit high stability (86.47% of original DPV signal retained up to 21 days at 4°C), good reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven electrodes), and superior selectivity over common interfering molecules.', 'Repeatability is demonstrated by five independent electrodes showing similar signals for 30 μM quinine.', 'Sensors are reusable and cost-effective.']}, {'Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) Features': ['IDA is a supramolecular sensing method where a host molecule binds an indicator dye, and the analyte (quinine) displaces the dye, resulting in a measurable signal.', 'The interaction in IDA is non-covalent and can be performed in aqueous media and even inside live cells.', 'IDA is compatible with differential sensing strategies, allowing for ultrasensitive and specific detection [10.1039/C7SC04989G].', 'Common host molecules for IDA include calixarenes and cyclodextrins, which act as synthetic receptors with high affinity and selectivity for target analytes.', 'IDA-based sensors can be coupled with various transduction methods, including optical and electrochemical outputs.']}, {'Quinine as a Target Analyte': ['Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid with low water solubility, typically dissolved in ethanol for stock solutions (10 mM).', 'It is detected in IDA-based electrochemical sensors as the target analyte, often with a 1:1 molar ratio with β-cyclodextrin.', 'Detection is commonly verified by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and other electrochemical techniques.']}, {'Host Molecules and Sensor Platforms': ['Calixarenes and cyclodextrins are frequently used as host molecules in IDA-based sensors due to their ability to form selective host-guest complexes with quinine and other drugs [10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4].', 'Calixarenes offer high sensitivity, adjustable cavity size, and ease of derivatization, making them suitable for drug detection applications.', 'Sensor platforms may include components such as poly(N-acetylaniline), graphene, and nanocomposites to enhance signal transduction and stability.']}], 'relationships': ['IDA serves as the recognition and signal transduction mechanism in electrochemical sensors for quinine.', 'Host-guest chemistry (e.g., calixarene-quinine or cyclodextrin-quinine complexes) underpins the selectivity and sensitivity of these sensors.', 'Nanocomposite materials and synthetic receptors (calixarene, cyclodextrin) are integrated to improve sensor performance.', 'IDA-based electrochemical sensors for quinine are validated using standard electrochemical techniques such as DPV and CV.']}
