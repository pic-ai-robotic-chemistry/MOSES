## 1. Are there electrochemical sensors using Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) to detect Quinine?

Currently, there is no explicitly documented electrochemical sensor employing an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) specifically designed for quinine detection. While electrochemical sensors based on nanocomposite materials—such as those incorporating beta-cyclodextrin, graphene, and poly(N-acetylaniline)—have demonstrated high stability, reproducibility, and the capacity for differential sensing (e.g., via DPV and CV), their applications have primarily focused on analytes like tryptophan.

IDA is a versatile supramolecular sensing strategy that relies on non-covalent host-guest interactions, where an indicator molecule is displaced upon binding of the target analyte to a synthetic receptor. This mechanism is well-suited for optical sensors and can be adapted to electrochemical platforms by designing receptors with affinity for specific analytes and indicators that produce measurable electrochemical signals.

Given quinine's structural features—an alkaloid with a complex, chiral, and aromatic framework—it can potentially be recognized by suitably designed supramolecular hosts, such as cyclodextrins or other macrocyclic receptors, which can form stable inclusion complexes. If these hosts are integrated into an electrochemical sensor and paired with an electroactive indicator, an IDA-based detection scheme could be established. The key would be to select a receptor with a high binding affinity for quinine (binding constants typically in the range of 10^4 to 10^6 M^-1) and an indicator whose electrochemical signal is significantly affected by displacement.

In summary, while the current literature and structured data do not explicitly document electrochemical IDA sensors for quinine, the fundamental principles and existing sensor components suggest that such a sensor is feasible. It would involve designing a host-guest system with high selectivity for quinine, coupled with an electroactive indicator, to enable sensitive and selective electrochemical detection via the IDA mechanism. This represents a promising area for further research and development in supramolecular electrochemical sensing.
