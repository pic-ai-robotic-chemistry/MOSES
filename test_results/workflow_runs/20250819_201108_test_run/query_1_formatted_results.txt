{'summary': 'There is no direct evidence from the provided data indicating that electrochemical sensors utilizing Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) are used to detect quinine. Existing information on electrochemical sensors and IDA does not specify quinine detection.', 'key_points': ['Electrochemical sensors are established methods for detecting various analytes, including nucleotides and tryptophan, often utilizing nanocomposite materials such as polyaniline with silver nanoparticles.', 'Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a fluorescence-based detection method used for ultrasensitive detection of molecules like LPA, often coupled with differential sensing for specificity.', 'No specific classes or studies were found linking IDA with electrochemical sensors for quinine detection.', 'The data does not include any documented use of IDA-based electrochemical sensors for quinine detection.'], 'relationships': ['While electrochemical sensors and IDA are both established detection methods, their combined application for quinine detection is not evidenced in the provided information.', 'Existing electrochemical sensors utilize host-guest interactions and nanocomposites, but there is no indication these are employed specifically for quinine via IDA.']}
