{'summary': 'There is no evidence from the provided data that electrochemical sensors utilizing Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) are currently used for Quinine detection.', 'key_points': ['Electrochemical sensors have been employed for detecting various analytes, such as tryptophan and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), often using host-guest interactions or nanocomposite materials.', 'No specific information or examples were found indicating the use of IDA in electrochemical sensors for Quinine detection.', "The term 'IDA' was not found in the relevant database, suggesting limited or no documented use in this context.", 'The only related information on IDA involved weak complexation with a different molecule (LPA), not Quinine.'], 'relationships': ['While electrochemical sensors are versatile and have been used with host-guest chemistry, there is no documented link between IDA techniques and Quinine detection in the provided results.', 'The absence of IDA in the context of Quinine suggests that alternative detection methods are likely employed for Quinine rather than IDA-based electrochemical sensors.']}
