{'summary': 'There is no direct evidence from the provided data indicating the existence of electrochemical sensors that specifically use Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) for quinine detection. Existing electrochemical sensors are primarily used for other analytes such as tryptophan, 5-FU, and nucleotides.', 'key_points': ['No specific electrochemical sensors employing IDA for quinine detection are documented in the provided results.', 'Electrochemical sensors have been developed for various analytes, including tryptophan, 5-FU, and nucleotides, often utilizing nanocomposites or host-guest interactions.', 'The concept of indicator displacement in electrochemical sensing is recognized but not explicitly linked to quinine detection in the current data.', 'Existing electrochemical sensors utilize materials like polyaniline with silver nanoparticles and host-guest chemistry involving Q(8).'], 'relationships': ['Electrochemical sensors are versatile and can employ host-guest interactions, but their application to quinine via IDA has not been confirmed in the provided results.', 'The absence of specific information on IDA-based electrochemical sensors for quinine suggests this may be an area lacking established methods or not yet documented.']}
