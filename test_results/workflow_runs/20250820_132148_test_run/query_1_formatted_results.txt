{'summary': 'Currently, there is no documented evidence of electrochemical sensors employing Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) specifically for the detection of Quinine.', 'key_points': ['Electrochemical sensors are established methods for nucleotide detection and other analytes, with properties such as good reproducibility, stability, and cost-effectiveness.', 'Some electrochemical sensors utilize host-guest interactions and nanocomposites, and are verified by techniques like differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV).', 'An electrochemical sensor employing IDA has been used for detecting tryptophan, not quinine, with high stability and reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven electrodes).', 'Indicator Displacement Assays (IDAs) are based on dye displacement from a host molecule, providing sensitive and specific detection, but no specific application for quinine detection via electrochemical IDA is documented.'], 'relationships': ['Electrochemical sensors can be constructed using IDA principles, but their application to quinine detection has not been reported.', 'The existing electrochemical sensors with IDA are primarily used for amino acids like tryptophan, not quinine.', 'IDAs are generally used for detecting molecules like caffeine, theophylline, and other targets, but not quinine specifically.']}
