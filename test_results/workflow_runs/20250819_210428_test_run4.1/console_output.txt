1.查询的最终答案: Yes, electrochemical sensors utilizing the Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) principle have been developed for the selective detection of quinine. In these systems, supramolecular host–guest chemistry is leveraged: a host molecule (often a macrocycle or functionalized nanocomposite) is pre-complexed with an electroactive indicator. Upon introduction of quinine, which has a higher binding affinity for the host, the indicator is displaced. This displacement event is transduced into an electrochemical signal, typically monitored by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

The IDA approach is particularly well-suited for quinine detection due to the molecule’s distinct structural features—such as its bicyclic quinoline moiety and tertiary amine—which enable strong non-covalent interactions (e.g., π–π stacking, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions) with appropriately designed hosts. The selectivity of the assay arises from the differential binding affinities: quinine’s higher affinity for the host displaces the indicator, resulting in a measurable change in current or potential.

Recent sensor designs often employ nanocomposite materials (such as graphene oxide or metal nanoparticles functionalized with supramolecular hosts) to enhance sensitivity and stability. These platforms exhibit excellent analytical performance, including high selectivity for quinine over structurally related alkaloids and common interferents, reproducibility (relative standard deviation ~2% across multiple electrodes), and stability (retaining over 85% of the original signal after three weeks at 4°C). Recovery rates for quinine in spiked samples typically range from 98% to 109%, indicating reliable quantification.

Mechanistically, the IDA-based electrochemical sensor operates as follows:  
1. The host–indicator complex is immobilized on the electrode surface.  
2. Upon exposure to quinine, competitive binding leads to displacement of the indicator.  
3. The change in electrochemical response (e.g., decrease or increase in current associated with the indicator) is proportional to the quinine concentration.

Binding constants (K_a) for quinine–host interactions in these systems are typically in the range of 10^4–10^6 M^–1, reflecting strong and selective molecular recognition. The thermodynamics of the displacement process are governed by the relative affinities of the host for the indicator and quinine, as well as the kinetics of exchange, which are generally rapid under assay conditions.

In summary, IDA-based electrochemical sensors represent a robust, selective, and sensitive supramolecular approach for quinine detection, with performance characteristics suitable for analytical and quality control applications in pharmaceutical and beverage matrices. The success of these sensors underscores the power of host–guest chemistry and indicator displacement strategies in modern chemical sensing.
