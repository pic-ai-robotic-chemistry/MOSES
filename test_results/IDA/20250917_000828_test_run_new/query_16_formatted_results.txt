{'summary': 'DSMI is the most suitable indicator for the TCC–butyrylcholine indicator displacement assay (IDA) system, based on its strong, well-characterized affinity for the TCC host, its cationic nature, and its established use as a fluorescent dye that is efficiently displaced by butyrylcholine, resulting in a measurable fluorescence response.', 'key_points': ['TCC is a large, anionic, water-soluble calix[4]arene-based host functionalized with four imidazole arms and sodium carboxylate groups, optimized for binding cationic guests in aqueous solution via ion-dipole and size/shape complementarity interactions.', 'Butyrylcholine (Bucho) is a cationic ester derivative of choline, serving as the analyte (C) and a competitive guest for TCC, with a quaternary ammonium group and a four-carbon acyl chain.', 'The indicator (B) in an IDA system must: (1) be a cationic dye with strong, but reversible, affinity for TCC (Kd in the low micromolar range), (2) exhibit a clear optical signal change (fluorescence or colorimetric) upon binding/displacement, (3) be efficiently displaced by butyrylcholine, and (4) be water-soluble and compatible with supramolecular host–guest chemistry in aqueous media.', 'DSMI: Dissociation constant (Kd) for TCC in buffer is 5.2 μM; required TCC:DSMI ratio for membrane sequestration is 1:1 (5 μM each); has strong affinity for cavitand_TCC; is a cationic, fluorescent dye with a well-documented fluorescence response upon displacement by butyrylcholine or choline analogs; forms a TCC·DSMI complex that is efficiently disrupted by butyrylcholine, restoring fluorescence.', 'DTMI: Kd for TCC in buffer is 8.9 μM; required TCC:DTMI ratio for membrane sequestration is 4:1 (20:5 μM); cationic cyanine dye with affinity for cavitand_TCC; is displaced by butyrylcholine and choline analogs, but its higher required host:guest ratio and less optimal fluorescence response compared to DSMI make it less suitable.', 'Methylene Blue (MB): Recognized by synthetic receptors and forms host–guest complexes; is displaced by PQ and quinine, but not specifically documented for TCC or butyrylcholine; fluorescence enhancement is observed upon displacement by PQ, but no quantitative affinity data for TCC is provided.', 'Safranine T (ST): Fluorescent, aromatic, and used as an indicator in some IDA systems (e.g., with carboxylato pillar(6)arene), but lacks specific affinity data for TCC and butyrylcholine; not documented as being displaced by butyrylcholine in TCC-based systems.', 'Anthracene: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with no cationic charge, no documented affinity for TCC, and no established use as a supramolecular indicator in aqueous IDA systems; lacks required optical response and water solubility.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) rely on competitive host–guest interactions, where the indicator must bind the host with moderate affinity and be efficiently displaced by the analyte, resulting in a measurable optical signal change (fluorescence or absorbance).', 'Host–guest interactions in supramolecular systems are characterized by parameters such as dissociation constant (Kd), association constant (Ka), and binding free energy, and are typically studied in aqueous solution using techniques like fluorescence spectroscopy, NMR, and ITC.', 'Cationic dyes with extended π-conjugation (e.g., DSMI, DTMI) are commonly used as indicators in IDA systems with anionic hosts like TCC, due to their strong optical responses and suitable binding affinities.', 'The TCC host is specifically designed for aqueous supramolecular chemistry, with anionic, water-solubilizing groups and a cavity optimized for cationic guest binding via ion–dipole and hydrophobic interactions.', 'DSMI and DTMI both exhibit micromolar affinity for TCC and are displaced by butyrylcholine, but DSMI is preferred due to its lower Kd, optimal 1:1 host:guest ratio, and robust fluorescence response upon displacement.'], 'relationships': ["DSMI forms a TCC·DSMI complex with a dissociation constant of 5.2 μM, which is efficiently disrupted by butyrylcholine, resulting in a fluorescence 'turn-on' response; this matches the IDA mechanism requirements for indicator displacement and signal restoration.", 'DTMI also forms a TCC·DTMI complex (Kd = 8.9 μM), but requires a higher host:guest ratio (4:1) for effective sequestration and has a less optimal fluorescence response compared to DSMI.', 'Methylene Blue, while a cationic dye and component of host–guest complexes, is not specifically documented for TCC–butyrylcholine systems and lacks quantitative affinity data for TCC, making it less suitable as an indicator in this context.', 'Safranine T is used as an indicator in some IDA systems (e.g., with carboxylato pillar(6)arene), but not with TCC or butyrylcholine, and lacks documented displacement by butyrylcholine in TCC-based systems.', 'Anthracene lacks cationic charge, water solubility, and documented host–guest affinity for TCC, and is not suitable as an indicator in aqueous supramolecular IDA systems.']}
