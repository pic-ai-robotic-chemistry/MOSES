{'summary': 'Acetylcholine (AcCh) is the most suitable analyte (unknown component) for the p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SCX4)/acridine dye (AcH⁺) indicator displacement assay (IDA) system, based on its strong, competitive binding to SCX4 and its ability to displace the indicator, restoring fluorescence.', 'key_points': ['p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SCX4) is a water-soluble, anionic host with a cup-shaped conformation, four phenol units linked by methylene bridges, and para-sulfonate groups (-SO₃⁻) imparting high water solubility and a negatively charged rim for cationic guest binding.', 'Acridine dye (AcH⁺) is a planar, tricyclic aromatic heterocycle with a central protonated nitrogen, acting as a cationic indicator. It is a well-known electron acceptor, has a ground state pKa of 5.4, and an absorbance maximum at 356 nm. It forms a supramolecular complex with SCX4 (A·B), resulting in fluorescence quenching.', 'The IDA system requires the analyte (C) to bind SCX4 more strongly than AcH⁺, displacing the indicator and restoring its fluorescence. The analyte must be a cationic species with high affinity for the SCX4 cavity, compatible with aqueous solution, and able to compete with the indicator for binding.', 'Acetylcholine (AcCh) is a polyatomic quaternary ammonium cation, a competitive binder to p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SCX4), and is detected by indicator displacement assay. It has a binding constant of 10^5 M^-1 with SCX4, is an analyte for supramolecular host-guest sensors, and triggers dye release and fluorescence ON upon displacement of the indicator.', 'Butyrylcholine and choline are also strong binders to SCX4 (K_d ~ 10 μM), can displace the indicator, and are signaling molecules, but acetylcholine is specifically referenced as a competitive binder and analyte for IDA with SCX4 and AcH⁺.', '4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and adamantylamine lack the required quaternary ammonium cationic structure and are not documented as strong competitive binders to SCX4 in this context. Acridine dye (AcH⁺) is already the indicator and cannot serve as the analyte.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDA) are supramolecular sensing strategies that utilize competitive host-guest interactions to detect analytes via optical (fluorescent or colorimetric) signal changes. The host (e.g., SCX4) must be water-soluble and possess a cavity with size, shape, and charge complementarity to the target analyte.', 'Host-guest interactions in IDA systems are characterized by non-covalent forces such as ion-dipole interactions, size/shape complementarity, and desolvation effects. Binding affinities are quantified by association constants (Ka) or dissociation constants (K_d), and the displacement of the indicator is monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy or UV absorption.', 'SCX4 is a macrocyclic host with a high affinity for cationic guests, especially quaternary ammonium ions, due to its anionic sulfonate rim and hydrophobic cavity. Acridine dye (AcH⁺) is encapsulated in the SCX4 cavity, resulting in fluorescence quenching; displacement by a stronger guest restores fluorescence.', 'Acetylcholine, choline, and butyrylcholine are all quaternary ammonium cations and known guests for SCX4. Their ability to displace the indicator is supported by strong binding affinities and observed emission changes upon addition to the SCX4/indicator complex. However, acetylcholine is specifically referenced as an analyte for IDA with SCX4 and AcH⁺, and its competitive binding effect is documented as triggering dye release and fluorescence ON.', 'The IDA system operates optimally at pH 7, with SCX4 dried overnight at 343 K (70°C), and acridine dye present at 14 μM concentration. The system is compatible with aqueous solution and is used for sensing in biological and chemical environments.'], 'relationships': ['SCX4 (host) forms a supramolecular complex with acridine dye (AcH⁺) (indicator), resulting in fluorescence quenching. Acetylcholine (AcCh) (analyte) binds competitively to SCX4, displacing AcH⁺ and restoring fluorescence (fluorescence ON).', 'Acetylcholine, choline, and butyrylcholine are all capable of displacing the indicator from SCX4, but acetylcholine is specifically referenced as a competitive binder and analyte for IDA with SCX4 and AcH⁺.', 'The binding constant of acetylcholine with SCX4 (10^5 M^-1) ensures effective competition with the indicator for the host cavity, a critical requirement for successful IDA operation.', 'Acridine dye (AcH⁺) is not suitable as the analyte because it is already the indicator in the system. 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and adamantylamine lack the required structural and charge characteristics for strong binding to SCX4 and are not documented as effective analytes in this context.']}
