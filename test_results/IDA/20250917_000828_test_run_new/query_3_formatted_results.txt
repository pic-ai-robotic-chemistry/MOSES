{'summary': 'Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) is the most suitable host for the IDA system with acridine dye (AcH⁺) as indicator and acetylcholine (AcCh) as analyte, due to its optimal cavity size, high water solubility, and strong, selective binding to cationic alkylammonium guests such as acetylcholine.', 'key_points': ['Acridine dye (AcH⁺) is a planar, tricyclic aromatic heterocycle with a protonated nitrogen, acting as a cationic, water-soluble indicator that can be encapsulated in macrocyclic host cavities and exhibits modulated photophysical properties upon binding.', 'Acetylcholine (AcCh) is a small, flexible quaternary ammonium cation (2-acetoxyethyltrimethylammonium) that serves as a competitive guest for anionic or neutral macrocyclic hosts, with a strong tendency to bind to hosts with anionic or electron-rich portals and hydrophobic cavities.', 'The host (A) in an IDA system must be water-soluble, possess a cavity size and shape compatible with both AcH⁺ and AcCh, and exhibit strong, selective binding to cationic guests, especially quaternary ammonium ions, to enable competitive displacement and signal restoration.', 'CB[7] is a water-soluble macrocyclic host with a rigid, barrel-shaped structure, a hydrophobic cavity (inner diameter 5.4 Å), and carbonyl-lined portals that stabilize cationic guests via charge-dipole interactions; it demonstrates high selectivity and strong binding affinity for trimethylammonium and other cationic alkylammonium motifs, including acetylcholine.', 'CB[7] forms 1:1 host-guest complexes with cationic guests, is compatible with aqueous buffer conditions (phosphate, ammonium acetate, water), and is widely used in supramolecular sensing, including IDA systems, due to its ability to modulate fluorescence and displace indicators upon analyte binding.', 'p-Sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SCX4) and p-sulfonatocalix[6]arene (SCX6) are also water-soluble, anionic macrocycles with sulfonate-functionalized rims and cup-shaped cavities, but their binding selectivity and cavity size are less optimal for acetylcholine compared to CB[7]; SCX4 is a known host for both acridine dye and acetylcholine, but CB[7] offers superior selectivity for trimethylammonium motifs.', 'β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a cyclic oligosaccharide with a hydrophobic cavity, but it primarily binds neutral or weakly cationic guests and small anions, with limited affinity for quaternary ammonium ions such as acetylcholine; its recognition is less selective and its cavity is less suited for the size and charge of acetylcholine.', 'p-tert-Butylcalix[4]arene is poorly water-soluble and lacks the anionic sulfonate groups necessary for strong binding to cationic guests in aqueous solution, making it unsuitable as a host in this IDA system.', '18-Crown-6 is a macrocyclic polyether with high affinity for alkali metal cations (e.g., K⁺, Na⁺) but does not effectively bind quaternary ammonium ions or aromatic cations in aqueous solution, and is not suitable for supramolecular IDA with these guests.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest interactions in supramolecular systems are characterized by size/shape complementarity, charge-dipole and hydrophobic interactions, and are typically studied by NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy, ITC, and UV-visible spectroscopy.', 'CB[7] is classified as a macrocyclic host, artificial receptor, and water-soluble macrocyclic host, with a well-defined hydrophobic cavity and carbonyl portals that provide strong charge-dipole stabilization for cationic guests.', 'CB[7] exhibits a 3500-fold selectivity for trimethyllysine over lysine, and its binding affinity for cationic alkylammonium products is stronger than for amino acids, making it highly effective for selective recognition of acetylcholine-like analytes.', 'CB[7] is compatible with biologically relevant buffer conditions (pH 7, phosphate, ammonium acetate, water), and its host-guest complexes can be monitored by fluorescence changes, including bathochromic shifts and fluorescence lifetime modulation (e.g., 350 ps for certain guests).', 'SCX4 and SCX6 are applied as hosts in self-assembled systems and can encapsulate cationic guests, but their selectivity and binding constants for acetylcholine are generally lower than those of CB[7].', 'β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) binds small organic molecules, dyes (e.g., methylene blue, quinine), and inorganic anions, but its cavity is less suited for quaternary ammonium cations, and its host-guest recognition is less selective for acetylcholine.', 'p-tert-Butylcalix[4]arene is a calixarene derivative with bulky tert-butyl groups, which reduce water solubility and limit its application as a host for cationic guests in aqueous IDA systems.', '18-Crown-6 is a macrocyclic polyether with high selectivity for alkali metal cations, not for quaternary ammonium or aromatic cations, and is not used as a host in IDA systems for these analytes.'], 'relationships': ['Acridine dye (AcH⁺) is encapsulated in SCX4 host cavities and is a probe for macrocyclic nanocavities, with its photophysical properties modulated by host binding.', 'Acetylcholine (AcCh) is a competitive binder for p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SCX4) and is detected by indicator displacement assays and supramolecular host-guest sensors.', 'CB[7] forms host-guest complexes with cationic guests (e.g., lysine, arginine, trimethyllysine, acetylcholine), and its cavity size and charge-dipole interactions are optimal for binding quaternary ammonium analytes.', 'Host-guest interactions in supramolecular systems are characterized by non-covalent interactions (charge-dipole, hydrophobic), size/shape complementarity, and are studied in aqueous media using NMR, fluorescence, and ITC.', 'CB[7] is a member of the cucurbituril family (CBn), is a macrocyclic host, and is used in supramolecular chemistry for selective recognition and sensing of cationic analytes in aqueous solution.']}
