{'summary': 'Quinine is the most suitable analyte for an indicator displacement assay (IDA) system using β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as the host and methylene blue (MB) as the indicator, due to its ability to form a stronger inclusion complex with β-CD and effectively displace MB, restoring the indicator signal.', 'key_points': ['β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a cyclic oligosaccharide host with a hydrophobic inner cavity and hydrophilic exterior, forming 1:1 inclusion complexes with suitable guest molecules via hydrophobic effect, hydrogen bonding, and size/shape complementarity (number_of_glucopyranose_units: 7; concentration: 10 mM; molar_ratio: 1:1 with MB/quinine).', 'Methylene blue (MB) is a cationic organic dye (indicator) that forms a 1:1 inclusion complex with β-CD, resulting in fluorescence quenching or color change; MB is displaced by quinine, restoring its signal (solution_concentration: 10 µM; is_displaced_by: quinine; is_probe_in_detection_of: quinine; is_located_in: β-CD).', "The analyte (C) in an IDA system must bind more strongly to β-CD than MB does, forming a stable inclusion complex and displacing MB from the host cavity; this requires appropriate molecular size, hydrophobicity, and functional groups compatible with β-CD's cavity.", 'Quinine is explicitly documented to displace MB from β-CD, forming a more stable inclusion complex (is_displaced_by: quinine; is_probe_in_detection_of: quinine; is_replaced_by: quinine; is_composed_of: β-CD, MB, quinine in inclusion_complex).', 'Other options (MB, cinchonidine, adamantylamine, aspirin, caffeine) are unsuitable: MB is already the indicator; cinchonidine, while structurally similar to quinine, lacks direct evidence of effective MB displacement; adamantylamine and aspirin do not match the required size/shape/hydrophobicity for strong β-CD binding; caffeine, though a β-CD guest, does not demonstrate MB displacement or superior binding affinity in this context.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assay (IDA) is a supramolecular sensing strategy based on non-covalent host-guest interactions, typically performed in aqueous solution, with optical sensor output (fluorescence or color change).', 'Host-guest interactions in β-CD systems are primarily driven by the hydrophobic effect, complemented by hydrogen bonding and ion-dipole interactions; binding affinity is influenced by hydrophobicity, molecular shape, and ionic strength (binding_affinity: hydrophobicity dominates over electrostatics; is_measured_by: ITC, fluorescence displacement model, NMR).', 'Inclusion complexes are characterized by 1:1 stoichiometry, strong non-covalent interactions (hydrophobic_binding, cation_pi_interaction, hydrogen_bonding), and are confirmed by techniques such as NMR, UV/Vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry.', 'The analyte must act as a competitor for the β-CD binding site, with an association constant (Ka) higher than that of MB (association_constant: 2.0 × 10^2 for analyte; >10^5 M^-1 for strong inclusion complexes).', 'Quinine, MB, and β-CD are all documented as participants in host-guest and inclusion complexes, with quinine specifically noted for MB displacement in β-CD systems.'], 'relationships': ['β-CD forms inclusion complexes with both MB and quinine, but quinine has a higher binding affinity, enabling it to displace MB from the β-CD cavity (is_displaced_by: quinine; is_replaced_by: quinine).', 'The IDA system relies on competitive binding: the analyte (quinine) must outcompete the indicator (MB) for the host (β-CD), resulting in a measurable signal change (dye_displacement, fluorescence_modulation).', 'Host-guest interaction and inclusion complex formation are central to the IDA mechanism, with the hydrophobic effect as the primary driving force for guest encapsulation in β-CD.', 'Experimental confirmation of inclusion complex formation and displacement is achieved through NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy, and ITC, supporting the selection of quinine as the analyte.', 'The supramolecular system is constructed using host-guest interactions, with β-CD as the macrocyclic host, MB as the indicator dye, and quinine as the competitive analyte guest.']}
