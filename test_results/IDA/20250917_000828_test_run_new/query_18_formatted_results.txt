{'summary': 'Cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) is the most suitable host for an indicator displacement assay (IDA) system with DTMI as the indicator and butyrylcholine as the analyte, due to its high affinity and selectivity for cationic alkylammonium guests, appropriate cavity size, and proven host-guest complexation with both DTMI and butyrylcholine.', 'key_points': ['DTMI is a cationic cyanine dye (N-methylbenzothiazolium cation linked via a vinyl bridge to a 4-(dimethylamino)phenyl group), acting as a fluorescent indicator (B) in the IDA system. It is displaced from the host by butyrylcholine, restoring its fluorescence signal.', "Butyrylcholine (Bucho) is a quaternary ammonium ester (analyte C) with a four-carbon acyl chain, acting as a cationic guest that competes for the host's cavity and displaces DTMI.", 'The unknown host (A) must be a water-soluble macrocyclic host with a cavity size and charge complementarity suitable for binding both DTMI and butyrylcholine, with higher affinity for butyrylcholine to enable indicator displacement. It must function in aqueous solution and form stable host-guest complexes with cationic guests.', 'CB7 (cucurbit[7]uril) is a macrocyclic host with a hydrophobic cavity (inner diameter 5.4 Å), high water solubility, and carbonyl-lined portals that stabilize cationic guests via charge-dipole and hydrophobic interactions. It exhibits strong binding affinity for cationic alkylammonium guests (such as butyrylcholine) and forms 1:1 host-guest complexes with dyes like DTMI and with quaternary ammonium analytes.', 'CB7 demonstrates selectivity for trimethylalkylammonium motifs and has a 3500-fold selectivity for trimethyllysine over lysine, indicating strong discrimination among cationic guests. It is widely used in IDA systems for cationic analyte detection and is compatible with fluorescence-based displacement assays.', 'TCC (imidazole-functionalized calix[4]arene) is also a water-soluble, anionic macrocyclic host with proven binding affinity for butyrylcholine and DTMI, and forms host-guest complexes (tcc_dtmi_complex). However, CB7 is more established for IDA with cationic guests and offers higher selectivity for quaternary ammonium ions.', 'SCX4 (p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene) is an anionic, water-soluble macrocycle with a negatively charged rim, but is less selective for quaternary ammonium guests and is not as widely used for IDA with butyrylcholine or DTMI.', 'WP6 (water-soluble pillar[6]arene) is a macrocyclic host with a rigid, pillar-shaped cavity and sodium carboxylate groups for water solubility. It forms host-guest complexes with cationic guests, but its cavity size and selectivity are less optimal for butyrylcholine and DTMI compared to CB7.', 'β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a cyclic oligosaccharide with a hydrophobic cavity, but it primarily binds neutral or weakly cationic guests and is less effective for strong binding of quaternary ammonium ions like butyrylcholine. Its anion-binding properties are weak and studied indirectly.', '[2.2.2]Kryptofix is a polyether amine cage selective for metal cations (e.g., K+), not for organic cationic guests like butyrylcholine or DTMI, and is unsuitable as a host in this IDA system.'], 'background_information': ["Indicator displacement assays (IDA) rely on competitive binding between an indicator and an analyte for a host's cavity, with the displacement event monitored by a change in the indicator's optical signal (e.g., fluorescence). The host must have a cavity size, shape, and charge environment compatible with both guests, and the system is typically performed in aqueous solution for biological relevance.", 'Host-guest interactions in supramolecular chemistry are characterized by non-covalent forces (hydrophobic, charge-dipole, hydrogen bonding, size/shape complementarity) and are studied by techniques such as NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', "CB7's hydrophobic cavity and carbonyl portals provide strong binding for cationic guests, especially those with trimethylammonium motifs, and its high water solubility and selectivity make it a gold standard for IDA systems targeting quaternary ammonium analytes.", 'TCC is a functionalized calix[4]arene with imidazole arms and sodium carboxylate groups, making it anionic and water-soluble. It forms host-guest complexes with choline analogs and cationic dyes, but is less selective than CB7 for quaternary ammonium ions.', 'SCX4 is a p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene with a cup-shaped conformation and a negatively charged rim, suitable for cationic guest binding but with lower selectivity and affinity for quaternary ammonium ions compared to CB7.', 'WP6 is a pillar[6]arene with a rigid, symmetrical cavity and sodium carboxylate groups for water solubility. It forms complexes with cationic guests but is less established for IDA with butyrylcholine and DTMI.', 'β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) has a hydrophobic cavity formed by seven glucopyranose units, is water-soluble, and is used for inclusion complexes with neutral or weakly cationic guests. Its binding to quaternary ammonium ions is weak and not optimal for IDA with butyrylcholine.', '[2.2.2]Kryptofix is a polyether cage designed for metal cation complexation and is not suitable for organic cationic guests.'], 'relationships': ['CB7 forms 1:1 host-guest complexes with both DTMI (indicator) and butyrylcholine (analyte), enabling competitive displacement and fluorescence signal restoration in IDA.', "CB7's selectivity for trimethylalkylammonium motifs directly matches the structural features of butyrylcholine, ensuring strong binding and effective displacement of DTMI.", "TCC also forms host-guest complexes with DTMI and butyrylcholine, but CB7's higher selectivity and established use in IDA systems for quaternary ammonium analytes make it the superior choice.", 'SCX4, WP6, and β-CD are less selective or have lower affinity for quaternary ammonium guests, making them suboptimal for this IDA system.', '[2.2.2]Kryptofix is fundamentally unsuitable due to its selectivity for metal cations rather than organic cationic guests.']}
