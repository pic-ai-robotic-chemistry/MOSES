{'summary': 'The most suitable host for the described IDA system with acridine dye (AcH⁺) as indicator and acetylcholine (AcCh) as analyte is p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SCX4), due to its water solubility, anionic character, and strong affinity for cationic guests such as AcCh and AcH⁺, which are essential for effective indicator displacement in aqueous supramolecular sensing.', 'key_points': ['Acridine dye (AcH⁺) is a planar, tricyclic aromatic heterocycle with a positive charge on the central nitrogen, acting as a cationic, water-soluble fluorescent indicator (B).', 'Acetylcholine (AcCh) is a small, flexible quaternary ammonium cation with a (2-acetoxyethyl)trimethylammonium structure, serving as the cationic analyte (C).', 'The host (A) must be water-soluble, possess a cavity of suitable size and shape for cationic guests, and exhibit strong, selective binding to both AcH⁺ and AcCh, with a preference for AcCh to enable indicator displacement.', 'p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SCX4) is a water-soluble, anionic macrocyclic host with a cup-shaped cavity, four para-sulfonate groups (imparting a net charge of -5 at pH 7), and phenolate groups at neutral pH, providing strong electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with cationic guests (DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2019.111656).', 'SCX4 is classified as a macrocyclic host, artificial receptor, and water-soluble macrocyclic host, and is specifically designed for host-guest interactions with cationic analytes in aqueous media.', 'β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a water-soluble, neutral macrocycle with a hydrophobic cavity, capable of host-guest recognition but lacking strong electrostatic attraction for cationic guests; its binding is primarily hydrophobic and less selective for quaternary ammonium ions.', 'p-tert-Butylcalix[4]arene is a neutral, hydrophobic macrocycle with bulky tert-butyl groups, poorly soluble in water, and thus unsuitable for aqueous IDA systems targeting cationic analytes.', '18-Crown-6 is a neutral, macrocyclic polyether with high affinity for ammonium cations via ion-dipole interactions, but its selectivity for quaternary ammonium ions (such as AcCh) is lower than for primary ammonium ions, and it lacks the strong anionic character and water solubility of SCX4.', 'Zeolite ZSM-5 is a crystalline aluminosilicate with rigid, non-specific channels, not a molecular host for selective supramolecular recognition in solution-phase IDA systems.', 'Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) is an electron-rich, planar molecule used in electrochemical switches, not a host or receptor for cationic guests.'], 'background_information': ["Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) rely on competitive binding between an indicator and an analyte for a host's cavity, with signal restoration upon displacement indicating analyte presence.", 'Effective IDA hosts for cationic analytes in water require anionic, water-soluble macrocyclic architectures to maximize electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, ensuring both strong binding and selectivity.', 'SCX4 and related sulfonatocalixarenes are established as hosts for quaternary ammonium ions and aromatic cations in aqueous supramolecular chemistry, with documented use in IDA and sensor applications (see DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2019.111656).', 'β-cyclodextrin is widely used in host-guest chemistry but is more suited for neutral or hydrophobic guests due to its neutral, hydrophilic exterior and hydrophobic cavity; it is less effective for selective binding of cationic analytes in competitive IDA systems.', 'Crown ethers, while capable of binding ammonium ions, are less selective for quaternary ammonium cations and lack the anionic, water-soluble features critical for robust IDA performance with AcCh and AcH⁺.', 'Macrocyclic hosts with anionic functional groups (e.g., sulfonates) at neutral pH provide enhanced selectivity and affinity for cationic guests through electrostatic complementarity.'], 'relationships': ["SCX4's anionic, cup-shaped cavity is complementary to the size, shape, and charge of both AcH⁺ and AcCh, enabling strong host-guest interactions and effective indicator displacement.", 'The negative charge of SCX4 (-5 at pH 7) and presence of phenolate groups facilitate strong electrostatic interactions with cationic guests, a property not shared by neutral hosts such as β-cyclodextrin or 18-crown-6.', "Host-guest interaction specificity in IDA systems is maximized when the host's cavity and charge distribution are matched to the analyte and indicator, as in the SCX4/AcCh/AcH⁺ system.", 'The exclusion of p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene, zeolite ZSM-5, and TTF is based on their lack of water solubility, absence of suitable host-guest recognition properties, or non-host function, which are fundamental requirements for IDA hosts in aqueous supramolecular sensing.']}
