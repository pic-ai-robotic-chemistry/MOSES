{'summary': 'The most suitable host for an indicator displacement assay (IDA) system with DTMI (a cationic cyanine dye) as indicator and butyrylcholine (Bucho) as analyte is TCC, a water-soluble, anionic, imidazole-functionalized calix[4]arene macrocycle, due to its demonstrated high binding affinity and selectivity for quaternary ammonium cations such as Bucho and DTMI in aqueous solution.', 'key_points': ['DTMI is a cationic cyanine dye (N-methylbenzothiazolium cation linked to a 4-(dimethylamino)phenyl group via a vinyl bridge) with strong fluorescence, serving as the indicator (B) in the IDA system. It forms supramolecular complexes with suitable hosts and is displaced by quaternary ammonium analytes such as butyrylcholine (Bucho).', 'Butyrylcholine (Bucho) is an esterified choline derivative with a quaternary ammonium cation and a four-carbon butyryl ester chain, serving as the analyte (C). It is structurally similar to choline and betaine, and is known to compete for binding to anionic macrocyclic hosts.', 'The host (A) in an IDA system with DTMI and Bucho must: (1) be water-soluble, (2) possess a cavity or binding site with high affinity for cationic guests (quaternary ammonium ions), (3) be anionic to enable strong electrostatic interactions, (4) have sufficient size/shape complementarity for both DTMI and Bucho, and (5) allow for competitive displacement of the indicator by the analyte, resulting in a measurable optical signal change.', 'TCC is a large, anionic, water-soluble calix[4]arene macrocycle functionalized with four imidazole arms and terminal sodium carboxylate groups. It is specifically described as a host for choline, butyrylcholine, choline analogs, and betaine, and forms host–guest complexes with DTMI (tcc_dtmi_complex) and DSMI (tcc_dsmi_complex). TCC exhibits high binding affinity for quaternary ammonium cations and is used in supramolecular sensing systems for these analytes.', 'β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a cyclic oligosaccharide with a hydrophobic cavity, known to bind small organic molecules and some anions (e.g., arylazopyrazole, halide ions), but lacks strong, selective affinity for quaternary ammonium cations in water and is not anionic. It is not documented to form host–guest complexes with DTMI or Bucho in the provided data.', 'Metal-Organic Framework ZIF-8 is a crystalline, porous material with a rigid, non-specific cavity structure, not designed for selective molecular recognition of cationic guests in aqueous solution. It lacks the necessary water solubility, charge complementarity, and supramolecular selectivity for IDA applications with DTMI and Bucho.', 'PNIPAM (Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)) is a linear, neutral macromolecule with no defined cavity or anionic character, and is not a supramolecular host for cationic guests. It is classified as a macromolecule, not a host or receptor.', '[2.2.2]Kryptofix is a bicyclic polyether amine designed for encapsulation of metal cations (e.g., K+, Na+), not for quaternary ammonium cations. It lacks the anionic charge and cavity size/shape required for selective binding of DTMI or Bucho.', 'Cisplatin is a square planar platinum(II) coordination complex, not a supramolecular host, and is chemically and functionally unrelated to the requirements of an IDA host for cationic organic guests.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are supramolecular sensing systems that rely on competitive binding between an indicator and an analyte for a host molecule, resulting in a measurable optical signal change (e.g., fluorescence modulation, dye displacement).', 'Host–guest interactions in IDA systems are characterized by size/shape complementarity, charge interactions (e.g., anionic host with cationic guest), and binding affinity, often quantified by association constants (Ka) and studied by techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, NMR, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', 'TCC is classified as an artificial host, anionic macrocycle, water-soluble artificial receptor, and supramolecular host, with specific application as an ammonium ion receptor and demonstrated selectivity for quaternary ammonium cations in aqueous media. It forms supramolecular complexes with cationic dyes (e.g., DTMI, DSMI) and is used in ratiometric and fluorescence-based sensing.', 'β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a cyclodextrin with a 7-membered glucopyranose ring, hydrophobic cavity, and hydrophilic exterior. It binds small hydrophobic molecules and some anions, but its affinity for quaternary ammonium cations is weak and non-selective compared to anionic macrocycles like TCC.', 'Host–guest interactions in supramolecular chemistry often involve macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and cyclodextrins, with selectivity determined by cavity size, charge, and functional group complementarity. Anionic calixarenes (e.g., TCC) are established hosts for cationic guests in aqueous solution, enabling competitive displacement assays.'], 'relationships': ["DTMI is displaced by butyrylcholine (Bucho), choline, and betaine in the presence of TCC, indicating TCC's high binding affinity and selectivity for quaternary ammonium cations and its suitability as a host in IDA systems with these analytes.", 'TCC forms specific host–guest complexes with DTMI (tcc_dtmi_complex) and DSMI (tcc_dsmi_complex), and is described as a host for choline, butyrylcholine, choline analogs, and betaine, directly supporting its role as the host (A) in the described IDA system.', 'β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is documented to bind small anions (e.g., halides, arylazopyrazole) but not quaternary ammonium cations, and is not anionic, making it unsuitable for selective binding and displacement of DTMI or Bucho in an IDA context.', 'Metal ions and PNIPAM are not supramolecular hosts for organic cationic guests and lack the necessary structural and charge features for IDA host function. [2.2.2]Kryptofix is selective for metal cations, not organic quaternary ammonium ions. Cisplatin is a coordination complex, not a host.']}
