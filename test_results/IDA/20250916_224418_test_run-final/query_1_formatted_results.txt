{'summary': 'Acridine dye (AcH⁺) is the most suitable indicator for the SCX4/acetylcholine (AcCh) indicator displacement assay (IDA) system, due to its cationic, water-soluble, fluorescent nature and its established ability to form a non-covalent host-guest complex with p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SCX4), which can be competitively displaced by acetylcholine, resulting in a measurable optical signal.', 'key_points': ['p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SCX4) is a water-soluble, anionic macrocyclic host (net charge -5 at pH 7) with a cup-shaped cavity and sulfonate groups at the para-positions, enabling strong electrostatic and ion-dipole interactions with cationic guests in aqueous solution (10.1016/j.molliq.2019.111656).', 'Acetylcholine (AcCh) is a small, flexible, polyatomic quaternary ammonium cation (analyte) that binds to SCX4 with a high binding constant (10^5 M^-1), acting as a competitive binder and capable of displacing other cationic guests from the SCX4 cavity.', 'The indicator in an IDA system with SCX4 and AcCh must be a cationic, water-soluble, chromophoric or fluorescent molecule that forms a non-covalent host-guest complex with SCX4, exhibits a measurable optical response (e.g., fluorescence quenching or enhancement) upon binding, and can be displaced by AcCh, restoring its signal.', 'Acridine dye (AcH⁺) is a planar, tricyclic, protonated aromatic heterocycle with a positive charge on the central nitrogen, is water-soluble, and is well-established as a fluorescent probe for macrocyclic nanocavities, including SCX4. It forms a host-guest complex with SCX4, is quenched upon binding, and is displaced by AcCh, resulting in a turn-on fluorescent response (dye concentration: 14 mM; absorbance λ = 356 nm; ground state pKa = 5.4).', 'Acridine dye is present in aqueous solution, is encapsulated in the SCX4 host cavity, and its photophysical properties (fluorescence, acid-base) are modulated by host-guest interaction and displacement (see also: is_quenched_by SCX4, is_displaced_by AcCh, is_bound_in scx4_cavity, is_released_by AcCh).', "Other options (TTF, PEDOT:PSS, YBCO, Grubbs' Catalyst, Vancomycin) are unsuitable due to lack of cationic charge, poor water solubility, inappropriate molecular size/structure, absence of chromophoric/fluorescent properties, or inability to form a reversible, competitive, non-covalent host-guest complex with SCX4 in aqueous solution."], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are supramolecular sensing strategies based on non-covalent host-guest interactions, typically involving a synthetic receptor (host), a chromophoric/fluorescent indicator (guest), and an analyte that competitively displaces the indicator, resulting in an optical sensor output (fluorescent or colorimetric).', 'Host-guest interactions in supramolecular systems are characterized by size/shape complementarity, ion-dipole and dipole-dipole interactions, and are studied using techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, NMR, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', 'Dyes suitable for IDA with SCX4 must be cationic, water-soluble, and exhibit strong fluorescence or color change upon binding/displacement. Acridine dyes are established as such indicators, with their fluorescence quenched by SCX4 and restored upon displacement by cationic analytes such as acetylcholine or choline.', 'The IDA system operates in aqueous solution at neutral pH, where SCX4 is highly anionic and acetylcholine is fully cationic, maximizing electrostatic host-guest interactions and competitive displacement.', 'Acridine dye is a well-known electron acceptor, with photophysical and acid-base properties modulated by encapsulation in macrocyclic hosts such as SCX4, and is used as a probe for macrocyclic nanocavities, micelles, and reverse micelles.'], 'relationships': ['SCX4 (host) forms a non-covalent host-guest complex with acridine dye (indicator), which is competitively displaced by acetylcholine (analyte), resulting in a measurable fluorescent response (dye_displacement, fluorescence_modulation).', 'Acridine dye is quenched by SCX4 (is_quenched_by), is bound in the SCX4 cavity (is_bound_in), and is released by acetylcholine (is_released_by), restoring its fluorescence (fluorescent_response occurs in aqueous_solution).', 'Acetylcholine is a competitive binder for SCX4, with a high binding constant (10^5 M^-1), and is capable of displacing acridine dye from the SCX4 cavity (is_competitive_binder_of acridine_dye, triggers dye release and fluorescence ON).', 'The IDA system relies on the relative binding affinities of the indicator and analyte for the host, with the analyte (AcCh) having a higher affinity for SCX4 than the indicator (acridine dye), enabling displacement and signal restoration.', "Other options (TTF, PEDOT:PSS, YBCO, Grubbs' Catalyst, Vancomycin) lack the necessary properties (cationic charge, water solubility, chromophoric/fluorescent response, appropriate molecular size/structure) to function as a competitive, displaceable indicator in the SCX4/AcCh IDA system."]}
