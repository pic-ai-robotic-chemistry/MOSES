{'summary': 'Butyrylcholine (Bucho) is the most suitable analyte for the TCC/DTMI indicator displacement assay (IDA) system, based on its strong, specific host-guest interaction with the TCC macrocyclic host and its proven ability to displace the DTMI indicator in aqueous solution.', 'key_points': ['TCC is a large, anionic, water-soluble calix[4]arene-based macrocyclic host, functionalized with four imidazole-containing arms and sodium carboxylate groups, optimized for binding cationic guests such as quaternary ammonium ions in aqueous solution.', 'DTMI is a cationic cyanine dye (N-methylbenzothiazolium cation linked to a 4-(dimethylamino)phenyl group via a vinyl bridge), serving as a fluorescent indicator that forms a supramolecular complex (TCC·DTMI) with TCC, resulting in fluorescence quenching.', 'Butyrylcholine (Bucho) is a cationic ester derivative of choline, featuring a quaternary ammonium head and a butyric acid ester tail, with strong binding affinity to TCC (K_d ~ 10 μM), and is experimentally confirmed to displace DTMI from the TCC·DTMI complex, restoring indicator fluorescence.', 'The IDA system requires the analyte (C) to bind TCC more strongly than DTMI, be water-soluble, cationic, and structurally compatible with the TCC cavity, enabling competitive displacement of the indicator and a measurable optical signal change.', 'Experimental parameters for Bucho displacement: displacement time = 1 h, concentration added = 50 mM, emission change = slightly lower increase compared to choline, confirming functional displacement and signal restoration.', 'DTMI is specifically displaced by butyrylcholine, choline, betaine, and choline analogs, but not by structurally or electronically dissimilar molecules.', 'TCC exhibits high binding affinity and selectivity for quaternary ammonium cations, including butyrylcholine, choline, and analogs, and forms stable host-guest complexes in aqueous media.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are supramolecular sensing strategies utilizing non-covalent host-guest interactions, where a host (synthetic receptor) binds an indicator, and the presence of a higher-affinity analyte displaces the indicator, resulting in an optical sensor output (e.g., fluorescence modulation).', 'Host-guest interactions in supramolecular systems are characterized by size/shape complementarity, ion-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding, and cavity interactions, and are quantified by association constants (Ka), binding free energy, and enthalpy/entropy changes.', 'TCC is designed for aqueous compatibility and biological applications, with rapid incorporation and endocytosis in HeLa cells, and is used for selective recognition of cationic biomolecules.', 'DTMI exhibits strong fluorescence emission when free, which is quenched upon complexation with TCC; displacement by a suitable analyte restores fluorescence, providing a turn-on optical signal.', 'Butyrylcholine functions as a signaling molecule in neurological and immune contexts, and its quaternary ammonium structure is recognized by TCC, similar to choline and acetylcholine.', 'Host-guest interactions are typically studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence spectroscopy, and UV absorption spectroscopy, confirming complex formation and displacement events.', 'The analyte class includes a wide range of cationic, zwitterionic, and biologically relevant molecules, but only those with appropriate charge, size, and solubility are compatible with the TCC host in this IDA system.'], 'relationships': ['TCC (host) forms a supramolecular complex with DTMI (indicator), resulting in fluorescence quenching; introduction of butyrylcholine (analyte) competitively binds to TCC, displacing DTMI and restoring fluorescence.', 'Butyrylcholine is structurally and electronically complementary to the TCC cavity, enabling strong host-guest interaction and effective indicator displacement.', 'DTMI is specifically expelled from the TCC·DTMI complex by butyrylcholine, choline, and related quaternary ammonium cations, but not by unrelated molecules.', 'Host-guest interaction selectivity is governed by the anionic, hydrophilic, and cavity-rich nature of TCC, which preferentially binds cationic, water-soluble guests.', "The IDA system's optical response (fluorescence turn-on) is directly linked to the competitive binding equilibrium between TCC, DTMI, and the analyte."]}
