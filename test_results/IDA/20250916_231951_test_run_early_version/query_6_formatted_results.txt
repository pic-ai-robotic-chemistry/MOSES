{'summary': 'The described system—Cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) as host, Methylene Blue (MB) as fluorophore indicator, and Amantadine (AMA) as analyte competitor—matches the essential mechanistic and component criteria for an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA), and there is direct ontology evidence that Amantadine is recognized by a fluorescence indicator displacement assay (F-IDA). However, a fully documented CB[8]/MB/AMA IDA system is not explicitly confirmed in the ontology; the system is highly plausible and supported by related documented IDA systems.', 'key_points': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is defined as a non-covalent, supramolecular sensing strategy involving a synthetic receptor (e.g., CB[8]), an indicator (e.g., MB), and an analyte (e.g., AMA), with optical sensor output and sensor conversion capability (ontology: indicator_displacement_assay(IDA)).', 'CB[8] (Cucurbituril[8]) is a macrocyclic host molecule that forms inclusion complexes with guest molecules, including Methylene Blue (MB) (ontology: cucurbituril_8(CB8) has_guest methylene_blue(MB)).', 'Methylene Blue (MB) forms an inclusion complex with CB[8] and is displaced by competitive guests (e.g., quinine), acting as a probe in detection schemes (ontology: methylene_blue(MB) has_inclusion_complex_with cucurbituril_8(CB8); is_displaced_by quinine; is_probe_in_detection_of quinine).', 'Amantadine (AMA) is recognized by a fluorescence indicator displacement assay (F-IDA) (ontology: amantadine(AMA) is_recognized_by fluorescence_indicator_displacement_assay(F-IDA)).', 'CB[8] is documented to form host-guest complexes with a variety of small molecules and drugs, and MB is a documented guest for CB[8], supporting the plausibility of the CB[8]/MB/AMA system as an IDA.', 'No direct ontology record confirms the specific CB[8]/MB/AMA IDA system, but all mechanistic and component requirements are met, and analogous systems (e.g., CB[8]/MB/quinine) are documented.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular chemistry method for analyte detection, typically using a synthetic receptor (e.g., CB[8]), a signaling indicator (e.g., MB), and a competitive analyte (e.g., AMA), with detection based on optical changes upon indicator displacement.', 'CB[8] is a macrocyclic host with high affinity for aromatic and hydrophobic guests, forming 1:1 or 1:2 complexes, and is used in supramolecular systems for molecular recognition, sensing, and control of protein/enzyme activity.', 'Methylene Blue (MB) is a phenothiazine dye that acts as a fluorophore indicator, forms inclusion complexes with macrocyclic hosts (CB[8], β-cyclodextrin), and is displaced by competitive guests, resulting in measurable optical or electrochemical changes (e.g., fluorescence, peak current).', 'Amantadine (AMA) is a tricyclic adamantane-based drug that can act as a competitive guest in host-guest systems and is associated with fluorescence intensification or attenuation in displacement assays.', 'Fluorescent Indicator Displacement Assay (F-IDA) is a subclass of IDA, using fluorescence as the sensor output, and is documented for the recognition of drugs such as Amantadine.', 'CB[8] has documented high selectivity for peptides with N-terminal aromatic residues and high binding affinity for certain tripeptides, but also forms complexes with small molecule drugs and dyes.', 'MB is used at concentrations such as 10 µM, with incubation times (e.g., 40 min) and measurable parameters (e.g., surface density 1.18 × 10^15 molecules/cm^2, peak current potential 0.24 V) in detection schemes.'], 'relationships': ['CB[8] (host) forms an inclusion complex with MB (indicator); MB is displaced by competitive guests (e.g., quinine, and plausibly AMA), resulting in a measurable optical signal change—this is the core mechanism of an IDA.', 'AMA is recognized by a fluorescence indicator displacement assay (F-IDA), indicating that AMA can act as a competitive analyte in such systems.', 'MB is a documented guest for CB[8] and is displaced by other guests in analogous IDA systems (e.g., quinine), supporting the mechanistic plausibility of MB displacement by AMA in a CB[8]-based IDA.', 'The system components (CB[8], MB, AMA) each have documented roles in IDA or F-IDA systems, and their interactions (host-guest complexation, indicator displacement, analyte competition) are consistent with the IDA mechanism.', 'CB[8] is classified as a synthetic receptor in the ontology, fulfilling the receptor requirement for IDA systems.']}
