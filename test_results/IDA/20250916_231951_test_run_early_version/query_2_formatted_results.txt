{'summary': 'The described system featuring β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as host, methylene blue (MB) as indicator, and quinine as analyte competitor is not directly documented as a known indicator displacement assay (IDA) system in the ontology, but all mechanistic and component criteria for an IDA are present, supporting its strong potential to function as an IDA.', 'key_points': ['Indicator displacement assay (IDA) is defined as a sensing method where a dye (indicator) is displaced from a host molecule by an analyte, resulting in a measurable signal (e.g., fluorescence change).', 'The described system consists of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as the synthetic receptor (host), methylene blue (MB) as the fluorophore indicator, and quinine as the analyte competitor.', 'MB is a well-established guest molecule for host-guest complexes and is recognized by synthetic receptors; it is known to be displaced by other guests (e.g., PQ) with a corresponding fluorescence enhancement upon displacement.', 'Host-guest interaction data indicate that quinine can displace MB from the β-CD cavity, consistent with the competitive binding mechanism required for IDA.', 'Host-guest complexes involving β-CD and guest molecules (including MB and quinine) are characterized by strong binding (binding constant up to 10^6 M^-1), 1:1 stoichiometry, and stabilization via hydrophobic, electrostatic, dispersion, and hydrogen bonding interactions.', 'Fluorescent indicators in such systems exhibit a change in fluorescence upon displacement, which is the signal transduction mechanism in IDA.', 'The ontology documents indicator displacement capability as a property of host-guest complexes, and MB is a component of such complexes.', 'No direct documentation of the β-CD/MB/quinine system as a published IDA is found, but all mechanistic and component requirements are met.'], 'background_information': ['β-cyclodextrin is a cyclic oligosaccharide with a hydrophobic cavity, widely used as a host in supramolecular chemistry for complexation with various guest molecules, including dyes and alkaloids.', 'Host-guest chemistry involving β-CD is typically investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, 1H NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', 'Methylene blue (MB) is a phenothiazine dye, commonly used as a fluorescent indicator in supramolecular assemblies and host-guest complexes; its fluorescence is sensitive to the local environment and binding state.', 'Quinine is a hydrophobic, quinoline-derived alkaloid with low water solubility, typically dissolved in ethanol or phosphate buffer solution for assays; it forms 1:1 complexes with β-CD and is detected by various analytical methods, including fluorescence assays.', 'Competitive binding is a well-established phenomenon in host-guest systems, where two or more guest molecules compete for inclusion in the host cavity, leading to displacement and signal change.', 'Host-guest complexes are supramolecular assemblies with defined stoichiometry (often 1:1), strong binding constants (up to 10^6 M^-1), and are stabilized by non-covalent interactions; they are used in optical sensors and smart functional materials.', 'Indicator displacement assays are a subclass of pattern-based sensing methods, with applications in the detection of small molecules, post-translational modifications, and drug determination.', 'Fluorescent indicators in IDA systems are characterized by a measurable change in fluorescence upon displacement, and the limit of detection is a key performance parameter.'], 'relationships': ['MB is a guest molecule that forms a host-guest complex with β-CD and can be displaced by a competing guest (e.g., quinine), resulting in a fluorescence change.', 'Quinine acts as a competitive guest, displacing MB from the β-CD cavity via host-guest interaction, which is the mechanistic basis for IDA.', 'The host-guest complex (β-CD/MB or β-CD/quinine) is stabilized by hydrophobic, electrostatic, dispersion, and hydrogen bonding interactions, with a typical 1:1 stoichiometry and strong binding constant (up to 10^6 M^-1).', 'Fluorescence change upon MB displacement is the signal transduction mechanism, fulfilling the IDA criteria.', 'Host-guest chemistry and supramolecular assembly concepts underpin the operation of the described system, with β-CD as the macrocyclic host and MB/quinine as guests.', 'The ontology documents indicator displacement capability as a property of host-guest complexes, supporting the mechanistic plausibility of the described system as an IDA.']}
