{'summary': 'There is no direct documentation of the specific WP6–DSMI–Amantadine system as a published indicator displacement assay (IDA), but the available data strongly support its potential to function as an IDA based on the molecular recognition properties, binding affinities, and competitive binding characteristics of the components involved.', 'key_points': ['No direct literature or ontology evidence confirms the exact combination of water-soluble carboxylato pillar[6]arene (WP6) as host, DSMI as indicator, and Amantadine (AMA) as analyte in a documented IDA system.', 'Amantadine (AMA) is recognized by fluorescent indicator displacement assay (F-IDA) systems, indicating its compatibility as a competitive guest in such assays.', 'DSMI (a styryl-pyridinium dye) is a chromophoric guest molecule and indicator with a fluorescence turn-off response, is displaced from host–guest complexes (e.g., tcc_dsmi_complex), and is quenched by adamantane derivatives (e.g., AMD), supporting its suitability as a fluorescent indicator in displacement assays.', 'WP6 (carboxylato pillar[6]arene) is a water-soluble, anionic, synthetic macrocyclic receptor with an electron-rich cavity, high affinity for hydrophobic and polycyclic guests (including adamantane derivatives), and is documented to form host–guest complexes with molecules structurally similar to Amantadine (e.g., 1-adamantanol, trimethylammonium cation).', 'Synthetic receptors such as WP6 exhibit high binding affinity (nanomolar to low micromolar) for hydrophobic guests in aqueous media, with selectivity and discrimination for polycyclic and cyclic hydrocarbons, and are functional in molecular sensing and optical sensor applications.', 'Binding affinity and competitive binding are critical for IDA function: the host (WP6) must bind the indicator (DSMI) with sufficient affinity to allow displacement by a stronger-binding analyte (AMA). WP6 is known to bind adamantane and its derivatives with high affinity, suggesting AMA can effectively compete with and displace DSMI from the WP6 cavity.', 'DSMI is displaced from host–guest complexes and its fluorescence is quenched by adamantane derivatives, indicating that AMA can induce a measurable optical response upon displacement, fulfilling the IDA mechanism.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are supramolecular sensing strategies based on competitive binding, where a synthetic receptor (host) forms a complex with a chromophoric or fluorogenic indicator, and the addition of an analyte (guest) with higher affinity displaces the indicator, resulting in a detectable optical signal change.', 'WP6 is a macrocyclic, water-soluble, anionic pillar[6]arene with an electron-rich hydrophobic cavity, designed for molecular recognition of hydrophobic, polycyclic, and cationic guests in aqueous environments. It is documented to bind a range of guests, including adamantane derivatives, with high affinity (nanomolar to low micromolar K_d).', 'DSMI is a styryl-pyridinium dye, acting as a turn-off fluorescent indicator, with documented host–guest complexation and displacement behavior in supramolecular systems. Its fluorescence is sensitive to the binding environment and is quenched by adamantane derivatives, supporting its use as a displacement probe.', 'Amantadine (AMA) is an adamantane-based antiviral drug, structurally compatible with the WP6 cavity, and is recognized in F-IDA systems. Its strong hydrophobic and steric complementarity to WP6 supports high-affinity binding and effective competition with indicator dyes.', 'Binding affinity in host–guest chemistry is typically characterized by thermodynamic parameters (K_d, ΔH), and is measured by ITC, NMR titration, or fluorescence displacement models. For effective IDA operation, the analyte must bind the host more strongly than the indicator, resulting in displacement and a measurable optical change.', "Host–guest recognition in aqueous media is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, with selectivity modulated by cavity size, charge, and guest structure. WP6's electron-rich, hydrophobic cavity is particularly suited for binding adamantane and related guests."], 'relationships': ['WP6 (host) forms high-affinity complexes with hydrophobic, polycyclic guests, including adamantane derivatives such as Amantadine (AMA), due to size and hydrophobic complementarity.', 'DSMI (indicator) is a suitable guest for WP6, forming a host–guest complex that exhibits a fluorescence turn-off response; its displacement by a stronger-binding analyte (AMA) results in a measurable optical signal change, consistent with the IDA mechanism.', 'Amantadine (AMA) is recognized in F-IDA systems and is structurally and functionally compatible with WP6, supporting its role as a competitive analyte capable of displacing DSMI from the WP6 cavity.', 'The IDA mechanism requires that the binding affinity of the analyte (AMA) for the host (WP6) exceeds that of the indicator (DSMI), leading to competitive displacement and a change in fluorescence; available data on WP6 and adamantane derivatives support this requirement.', 'Synthetic receptors such as WP6 are functional in aqueous media, enabling IDA operation in physiologically relevant conditions and supporting applications in molecular sensing and drug detection.']}
