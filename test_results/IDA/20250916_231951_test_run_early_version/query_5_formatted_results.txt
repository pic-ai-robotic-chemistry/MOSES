{'summary': 'The system comprising Cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), Proflavine (PF), and Gefitinib (GEF) is directly supported as a documented fluorescent indicator displacement assay (F-IDA) system, with explicit evidence of competitive binding and fluorescence signaling consistent with IDA mechanisms.', 'key_points': ['CB[8] acts as a synthetic receptor (macrocyclic host) capable of forming host-guest complexes with a variety of aromatic and drug-like molecules, including proflavine and gefitinib.', 'Proflavine (PF) forms a 1:2 complex with cucurbit(8)uril (q(8)), resulting in quenched fluorescence; upon addition of gefitinib (GEF), the fluorescence intensity of proflavine recovers, indicating displacement from the CB[8] cavity.', 'Gefitinib (GEF) is encapsulated by CB[8] (q(8)), with reported concentrations for competitive binding studies (e.g., 5 μM, 1 × 10^-3 mol L^-1, 0-300 × 10^-8 mol L^-1), and is sensed by F-IDA (fluorescent indicator displacement assay).', 'The fluorescence response is specific: proflavine fluorescence is quenched in the CB[8]-PF complex and recovers upon displacement by gefitinib, which itself is non-fluorescent in aqueous solution.', 'The system operates in aqueous solution, with incubation times (e.g., 30 min) and solvent (water) specified for complex formation and displacement assays.', "The indicator displacement mechanism is confirmed by the property: 'fluorescence intensity decreases with cucurbit(8)uril(q(8)), recovers with gefitinib(gef)'.", 'The system fulfills the canonical IDA architecture: synthetic receptor (CB[8]), optical indicator (proflavine), analyte competitor (gefitinib), and optical sensor output (fluorescence change).'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are characterized by a synthetic receptor binding a signaling indicator, which is displaced by an analyte, resulting in a measurable optical change; F-IDA is a subclass utilizing fluorescence as the sensor output.', 'CB[8] is a macrocyclic host from the cucurbituril family, known for strong and selective host-guest interactions with aromatic and drug-like molecules, and is widely used in supramolecular and host-guest chemistry for molecular recognition studies.', 'Proflavine is an acridine dye with strong fluorescence properties, commonly used as a fluorophore indicator in supramolecular sensing systems.', 'Gefitinib is an anilinoquinazoline EGFR inhibitor, non-fluorescent in aqueous solution, and can be detected via competitive binding in supramolecular systems.', 'Host-guest chemistry involving CB[8] is typically investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, 1H NMR, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', 'Molecular recognition in these systems is governed by non-covalent interactions (electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic effect, ion-dipole interactions), and occurs in aqueous media, with recognition efficiency and selectivity influenced by cavity size and guest structure.', 'Supramolecular chemistry, as a subfield, focuses on noncovalent interactions, inclusion phenomena, and the design of molecular assemblies for sensing, separation, and biological applications.'], 'relationships': ['CB[8] forms a 1:2 host-guest complex with proflavine, quenching its fluorescence; gefitinib competitively binds to CB[8], displacing proflavine and restoring fluorescence, which is the basis for the F-IDA response.', 'Gefitinib is sensed by F-IDA in this system, with the fluorescence change of proflavine serving as the optical sensor output for analyte detection.', 'The system demonstrates competitive binding: both proflavine and gefitinib are guests for CB[8], but only proflavine is fluorescent, enabling displacement-based signaling.', 'The supramolecular assembly operates in aqueous solution, with all components (CB[8], proflavine, gefitinib) forming non-covalent complexes under these conditions.', 'The system architecture aligns with the canonical IDA: synthetic receptor (CB[8]), optical indicator (proflavine), analyte competitor (gefitinib), and optical sensor output (fluorescence change).']}
