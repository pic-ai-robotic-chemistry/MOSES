{'summary': 'The described system involving TCC (a macrocyclic cavitand), DTMI (a cyanine-type styryl benzothiazole dye), and butyrylcholine (Bucho) is not directly documented as an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) system in the available ontology, but it possesses all the essential components and mechanistic features required for an IDA and is highly likely to function as such.', 'key_points': ['DTMI is classified as an indicator and dye, and forms a host-guest complex with TCC (tcc_dtmi_complex).', 'DTMI is displaced by butyrylcholine (Bucho), choline (Cho), betaine (Bet), and choline analog (Cha) from its complex with TCC, indicating competitive binding and displacement.', 'TCC is a synthetic macrocyclic cavitand receptor with R1 = CH2CO2Na and R2 = Et on benzimidazole units, and acts as a host for butyrylcholine (Bucho), choline (Cho), betaine (Bet), and choline analog (Cha).', 'TCC forms host-guest complexes with both DTMI and Bucho, and exhibits binding affinity for these guests, supporting the competitive displacement mechanism.', 'The system is monitored via fluorescence, as DTMI has a fluorescence response mechanism and its emission is modulated by host-guest interactions and displacement events.', 'DTMI fluorescence is quenched by the host (TCC) and quenching is removed upon displacement by Bucho or Cho, consistent with the signaling mechanism of an IDA.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is defined as a supramolecular sensing strategy where a synthetic receptor (host) binds an indicator (often a dye), and the presence of an analyte (guest/competitor) displaces the indicator, resulting in a measurable signal change (e.g., fluorescence).', 'IDA systems typically require: (1) a synthetic receptor, (2) an indicator (dye), (3) an analyte/competitor, and (4) a measurable signal output (optical/fluorescence).', 'The ontology classifies TCC as a synthetic receptor, macrocyclic host, and water-soluble artificial receptor, and DTMI as an indicator and dye, fulfilling the canonical IDA system requirements.', 'The displacement of DTMI by Bucho from the TCC-DTMI complex, with associated fluorescence changes, matches the operational principle of a fluorescent indicator displacement assay (F-IDA).', 'Host-guest interactions in such systems are typically studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and fluorescence data, as indicated in the ontology.'], 'relationships': ['DTMI forms a host-guest complex with TCC (tcc_dtmi_complex), and is displaced by butyrylcholine (Bucho), choline (Cho), betaine (Bet), and choline analog (Cha), demonstrating competitive binding and indicator displacement.', 'TCC acts as a host for both DTMI (indicator) and Bucho (analyte/competitor), supporting the IDA mechanism.', 'Fluorescence emission of DTMI is modulated by its interaction with TCC and is restored upon displacement by Bucho, providing the optical signal output characteristic of an IDA.', "The system's components and mechanistic relationships (host, indicator, analyte, signal output) are fully consistent with the requirements for a fluorescent indicator displacement assay (F-IDA), even though this specific system is not explicitly documented as an IDA in the ontology."]}
