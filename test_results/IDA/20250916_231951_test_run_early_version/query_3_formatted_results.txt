{'summary': 'The described system, comprising the synthetic receptor TCC (a resorcinarene-based cavitand with imidazole-acetic acid sodium salt arms), the styryl-pyridinium dye DSMI as a fluorophore indicator, and acetylcholine as the analyte, exhibits all the essential features of a documented Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) system, specifically a fluorescent indicator displacement assay (F-IDA).', 'key_points': ['The system architecture includes a synthetic receptor (TCC), a fluorescent indicator (DSMI), and a competitive analyte (acetylcholine), matching the canonical components of an indicator displacement assay (IDA).', 'TCC is a resorcinarene-based cavitand functionalized with four imidazole-acetic acid sodium salt arms, acting as a water-soluble artificial receptor with strong binding affinity for choline (K_d ~ 10 Î¼M) and related quaternary ammonium cations.', 'DSMI is a styryl-pyridinium dye that forms a host-guest complex with TCC (tcc_dsmi_complex), exhibiting fluorescence quenching (turn-off) when bound and fluorescence turn-on upon displacement by choline/acetylcholine.', "Choline (Cho), structurally depicted as acetylcholine (a quaternary ammonium ester), acts as a competitive binder, displacing DSMI from the TCC-DSMI complex, resulting in a large increase in fluorescence emission (displacement effect: 'displacement occurs', emission change: 'large increase when bound in the cavitand').", 'Acetylcholine is explicitly detected by indicator displacement assay (is_detected_by: indicator_displacement_assay), with a reported binding constant of 10^5 M^-1 for similar host-guest systems.', "DSMI is displaced from the tcc_dsmi_complex by choline/acetylcholine, with a displacement time of 1 h and a required equimolar amount of TCC for relocation; fluorescence is 'quenched (by AMD), turn-on (by incubation with Cho)'.", 'The system operates in aqueous media (PBS solution), is compatible with live cell environments (HeLa cells), and is observed by confocal microscopy, consistent with documented F-IDA methodologies.', "The system's mechanism is non-covalent, based on competitive binding and molecular recognition, with the primary driving force being electrostatic attraction and ion-dipole interactions."], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assay (IDA) is a supramolecular sensing strategy involving a synthetic receptor, a signaling indicator, and a competitive analyte; displacement of the indicator by the analyte leads to a measurable optical signal (e.g., fluorescence turn-on).', 'Fluorescent indicator displacement assay (F-IDA) is a subclass of IDA where the sensor output is optical (fluorescence), and the assay is often performed in aqueous media and live cells.', "Molecular recognition in such systems is governed by non-covalent interactions (electrostatic, hydrophobic, ion-dipole), with selectivity modulated by the receptor's cavity size and functional group orientation.", 'TCC is classified as a macrocyclic synthetic receptor, cavitand, and water-soluble artificial host, with documented host-guest chemistry for quaternary ammonium ions (e.g., choline, acetylcholine).', 'DSMI is a turn-off sensor dye, acting as a chromophoric guest molecule and indicator, with fluorescence emission that is modulated by host-guest interactions and competitive displacement.', 'Acetylcholine is a biologically important neurotransmitter, a polyatomic quaternary ammonium cation, and a competitive binder in supramolecular host-guest systems; it is a recognized analyte for supramolecular sensors and is detected by IDA methodologies.', "The system's operation in live cells (HeLa) and aqueous environments is consistent with advanced IDA/F-IDA applications for biological and analytical sensing."], 'relationships': ['TCC forms a host-guest complex with DSMI (tcc_dsmi_complex), resulting in fluorescence quenching; addition of choline/acetylcholine competitively displaces DSMI, restoring fluorescence (turn-on).', 'Choline/acetylcholine acts as a competitive binder for TCC, with strong binding affinity, and triggers the release of the indicator (DSMI) from the receptor complex.', 'The fluorescence response of DSMI is modulated by its binding state: lower intensity when bound to TCC, higher (turn-on) when displaced by choline/acetylcholine.', "The system's sensing mechanism is based on competitive binding and molecular recognition, with the indicator displacement event providing the optical readout characteristic of IDA/F-IDA.", 'The system is compatible with live cell imaging and operates in aqueous media, demonstrating its applicability for biological sensing of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine.']}
