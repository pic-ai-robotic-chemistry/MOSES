## 4.1

When a **calixarene containing pyrrole groups** binds an anion, the **specific non-covalent interactions** typically involved are:

### 1. **Hydrogen Bonding**

- **Pyrrole NH groups** are excellent hydrogen bond donors.
- The **NH protons** of the pyrrole rings can form **hydrogen bonds** with the anion (especially with basic anions like Cl⁻, NO₃⁻, H₂PO₄⁻, etc.).
- This is often the **primary interaction** in anion binding by pyrrole-functionalized calixarenes.

### 2. **Electrostatic (Ion-Dipole) Interactions**

- The **partial positive charge** on the hydrogen atoms of the pyrrole NH groups can interact electrostatically with the **negative charge** of the anion.

### 3. **π-Anion Interactions (if applicable)**

- In some cases, the **π-system** of the pyrrole or aromatic rings can interact with the anion via **anion–π interactions**, though this is generally weaker than hydrogen bonding.

### 4. **Encapsulation/Cavity Effects**

- The **preorganized cavity** of the calixarene can provide a **size- and shape-selective environment** that enhances binding through **multiple cooperative interactions**.

**In summary:**  
The main non-covalent interaction is **hydrogen bonding** from the pyrrole NH groups to the anion, often supported by electrostatic interactions and the preorganized calixarene cavity.

In calixarenes that incorporate pyrrole rings (e.g., calix[4]pyrrole and its derivatives) the anionic guest is not covalently attached but is held in the cavity by a collection of non-covalent forces dominated by hydrogen bonding.  The interactions normally invoked are:

• A set of directional N–H···X⁻ hydrogen bonds  
  – Each pyrrolic N–H acts as a hydrogen-bond donor to the anion (Cl⁻, F⁻, NO₃⁻, H₂PO₄⁻, etc.).  
  – In a calix[4]pyrrole the four NH groups form four convergent H-bonds that “wrap” the anion.

• Complementary electrostatic / ion–dipole attraction  
  – The macrocycle presents the anion with a polarized, partially positive pocket; any cationic or electron-withdrawing substituents enhance this Coulombic component.

• Secondary, weaker contacts  
  – C–H···X⁻ hydrogen bonds from meso-CH or aryl CH groups near the cavity.  
  – In derivatives bearing electron-poor aryl walls, an anion-π interaction between the anion and the face of the aromatic ring can add further stabilization.

Thus the binding motif is characterized primarily by multiple pyrrolic N–H···anion hydrogen bonds, assisted by ion-dipole and occasional C–H or anion-π contacts.

## Non-Covalent Interactions in Calixarene–Anion Binding (with Pyrrole Groups)

When a calixarene scaffold incorporates pyrrole units (as seen in calix[4]pyrroles), its ability to bind anions is governed by several specific non-covalent interactions. The primary mechanisms and interactions are as follows:

### 1. Hydrogen Bonding  

- **Inward-directed NH groups** on the pyrrole units play a central role.  
- Each NH group acts as a hydrogen bond donor, directing its hydrogen atoms inward toward the cavity center, where the anion can fit.
- Upon anion approach, these NH groups form strong and directional hydrogen bonds with the anion, stabilizing the host-guest complex.
- For example, chloride and other similarly sized anions are efficiently bound via a network of four convergent NH···anion hydrogen bonds.

### 2. Conformational Effects and Hydrophobic Cavity  

- The act of hydrogen bonding from the NH groups typically locks the calix[4]pyrrole host into a **cone conformation**, optimizing the geometry for simultaneous multipoint hydrogen bonding.
- The cavity that forms can become somewhat hydrophobic, depending on the substitution at the meso positions, which can further influence anion affinity and selectivity.

### 3. Electrostatic Interactions  

- If the anion is charged (as most are), there are significant charge–dipole and sometimes charge–induced dipole interactions in addition to hydrogen bonding.
- These interactions arise due to the local positive potential generated by the NH moieties in the host cavity and the negative charge of the anion.

### 4. Secondary Interactions  

- Structural variations, such as large meso substituents, can create additional hydrophobic pockets that might stabilize the encapsulated anion or influence selectivity through steric and van der Waals effects.
- If the calixarene is further functionalized (e.g., with cationic substituents), other effects such as anion–π and further electrostatic interactions could play a minor, supportive role.

## Mechanistic Summary

The dominant non-covalent interaction is **hydrogen bonding** from the pyrrole NH groups engaging the anion. Conformational requirements of the macrocycle enhance this effect, and electrostatic stabilization further supports binding. The combination of these interactions makes such calixarene-pyrrole hosts highly effective for selective anion binding in supramolecular chemistry.

## MOSES

When a calixarene functionalized with pyrrole groups binds an anion, the binding event is governed by a sophisticated interplay of non-covalent interactions, characteristic of supramolecular host–guest chemistry. The principal interactions involved are:

**1. Hydrogen Bonding (Primary and Most Selective Interaction):**  
The pyrrole NH groups serve as potent hydrogen bond donors. Upon anion binding, these NH protons form directional hydrogen bonds with the anion, which is often the dominant factor dictating both the strength and selectivity of binding. The geometry and preorganization of the calixarene scaffold position the pyrrole NHs to maximize these interactions. Quantitative studies report hydrogen bond distances in such systems typically in the range of 2.5–3.0 Å, consistent with strong, specific hydrogen bonding. This interaction is especially critical for anions capable of acting as good hydrogen bond acceptors (e.g., halides, carboxylates, phosphates).

**2. Electrostatic Interactions:**  
Electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged anion and any positively polarized regions of the calixarene–pyrrole host (including protonated or electron-deficient sites) contributes to the overall binding affinity. While these interactions can drive the initial association and guest localization within the calixarene cavity, they are generally less discriminating than hydrogen bonds and are highly sensitive to the dielectric environment (e.g., solvent polarity, presence of competing ions).

**3. Anion–π Interactions:**  
The aromatic nature of the pyrrole rings and the hydrophobic, π-rich cavity of the calixarene enable anion–π interactions, wherein the anion is stabilized by the quadrupole moment of the aromatic system. These interactions, while generally weaker than hydrogen bonds, can provide additional stabilization, particularly for anions with diffuse charge distributions or in cases where the anion is sandwiched between multiple aromatic surfaces.

**4. Sigma-Hole and Hydrophobic Effects:**  
In some cases, sigma-hole interactions (regions of positive electrostatic potential on atoms such as hydrogen or halogens) may further stabilize the anion within the host. The hydrophobic concavity of the calixarene also plays a role by providing a low-polarity environment that can enhance the effective strength of hydrogen bonding and anion–π interactions, especially in less polar solvents.

**Structure–Property Relationships and Selectivity:**  
The selectivity of anion binding is primarily dictated by the spatial arrangement and acidity of the pyrrole NH groups, the size and shape of the calixarene cavity, and the complementarity between the host and the guest. Rigid, preorganized calixarene scaffolds with appropriately oriented pyrrole groups exhibit higher binding constants and selectivity due to reduced entropic penalties and optimal hydrogen bond formation.

**Thermodynamics and Mechanistic Insights:**  
Binding is typically enthalpically driven, with negative ΔH values reflecting strong hydrogen bonding and, to a lesser extent, anion–π and electrostatic contributions. The entropy change (ΔS) can be either favorable or unfavorable, depending on the degree of preorganization and desolvation effects upon complexation. Binding constants (K_a) for such systems can range from 10^2 to >10^6 M^–1, depending on the anion, solvent, and receptor design.

**Summary Table of Key Interactions:**

| Interaction Type       | Role in Binding          | Selectivity Contribution | Typical Strength  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Hydrogen bonding       | Primary, directional     | High                     | Strong            |
| Electrostatic          | Guest localization       | Moderate                 | Variable          |
| Anion–π                | Additional stabilization | Moderate                 | Weak–moderate     |
| Sigma-hole/hydrophobic | Modulation/enhancement   | Low–moderate             | Context-dependent |

**Conclusion:**  
Anion binding by calixarenes containing pyrrole groups is a multifaceted process dominated by strong, directional hydrogen bonds between pyrrole NH donors and the anion, with electrostatic and anion–π interactions providing additional stabilization. The precise balance and synergy of these non-covalent forces, modulated by the host’s structure and the environment, underpin the high selectivity and affinity characteristic of these supramolecular systems.
