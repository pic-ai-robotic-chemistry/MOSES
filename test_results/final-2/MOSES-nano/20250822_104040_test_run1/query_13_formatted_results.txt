{'summary': 'Molecules that typically act as guests for supramolecular hosts include organic molecules such as aromatic compounds, alkyl chains, and functionalized ligands, as well as inorganic ions like metal cations and anions, which interact through various non-covalent forces within host cavities.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules encompass a broad class including organic molecules (e.g., aromatic, alkyl, and functional groups) and inorganic ions (e.g., metal cations, anions).', 'Organic guests often contain aromatic moieties, hydrophobic or hydrophilic side groups, and functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions.', 'Inorganic guests primarily include inorganic anions and metal ions, which can be coordinated or encapsulated by macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and cyclodextrins.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular host-guest chemistry relies on non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, electrostatic forces, and coordination bonds. Organic molecules with aromatic or hydrophobic regions are common guests due to their ability to engage in π-π interactions and hydrophobic effects within host cavities. Inorganic ions, especially metal cations, serve as guests in coordination complexes, often influencing the structure and function of the host assembly. Macrocyclic hosts like cucurbiturils and calixarenes are designed to selectively bind specific ions or molecules based on size, charge, and functional group complementarity.', 'The structural features of guest molecules, such as the presence of functional groups (imidazole, benzyl, etc.), hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, and charge, determine their binding affinity and selectivity. For example, cucurbiturils can encapsulate positively charged organic or inorganic species, while calixarenes can coordinate metal ions or bind anions through their cavity and functionalized rims.'], 'relationships': ['Organic guest molecules often contain aromatic moieties and functional groups that facilitate π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding within host cavities.', "Inorganic ions, including metal cations and anions, are common guests in macrocyclic hosts, with binding strength influenced by the host's cavity size, charge density, and functionalization.", 'The structural diversity of guest molecules allows for tailored host-guest systems, enabling applications in drug delivery, sensing, and molecular recognition.']}
