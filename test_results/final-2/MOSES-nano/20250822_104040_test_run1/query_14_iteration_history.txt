[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': "The query is asking for specific examples or categories of macrocyclic compounds, which are large ring molecules in chemistry. Based on the tool analysis, classes related to macrocycles are likely to include 'macrocycle', 'macrocyclic compound', and subclasses such as 'crown ethers', 'cryptands', 'porphyrins', and 'calixarenes'.

The question aims to identify particular structural types or subclasses of macrocyclic molecules, emphasizing their diversity and specific features.", 'hypothetical_answer': 'Macrocycles are large ring molecules characterized by their cyclic structure containing twelve or more atoms. Some specific types of macrocycles include:\n\n- Crown Ethers: Cyclic compounds with oxygen atoms that can coordinate metal cations, used in phase transfer catalysis.\n- Cryptands: Three-dimensional macrocyclic ligands capable of encapsulating ions, often used in host-guest chemistry.\n- Porphyrins: Tetrapyrrolic macrocycles that form the core of heme, chlorophyll, and vitamin B12, playing vital roles in biological systems.\n- Calixarenes: Phenolic macrocycles with a cup-shaped structure, useful in molecular recognition and sensors.\n- Cyclodextrins: Cyclic oligosaccharides derived from
