{'summary': 'Cage molecules are primarily used for accommodating specific guest molecules such as methyl groups and indole rings, whereas macrocycles are extensively applied in biomolecular recognition, sensing, and as supramolecular hosts, with overlapping uses in molecular recognition and host-guest chemistry.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules can host specific entities like methyl groups and indole rings, indicating their role in selective encapsulation.', 'Macrocycles are employed in diverse applications including biomolecule recognition, sensing platforms, and as components of artificial light-harvesting systems, with intrinsic fluorescence and structural features facilitating these functions.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles participate in host-guest chemistry, including inclusion complex formation and molecular recognition, highlighting overlapping applications.'], 'background_information': ['Cage molecules are typically characterized by their three-dimensional, polyhedral structures capable of encapsulating guest molecules, often used in molecular storage, separation, or catalysis.', 'Macrocycles, such as cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, and pillararenes, are cyclic compounds with large ring sizes that enable selective binding through non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic effects.', 'Applications of macrocycles extend to drug delivery, molecular sensors, and as scaffolds in supramolecular chemistry, with their structural features allowing for functionalization and integration into nanostructures.'], 'relationships': ['Both cage molecules and macrocycles serve as supramolecular hosts, facilitating inclusion complexes and guest exchange processes.', "Macrocycles are often integrated into nanostructures and sensing scaffolds, similar to cage molecules' ability to accommodate specific guest entities.", 'The structural features such as aromatic surfaces, hydrophobic cavities, and hydrogen-bonding units are critical for their respective functions, with macrocycles often exhibiting intrinsic fluorescence and specific binding affinities, while cages focus on encapsulation of particular molecules.']}
