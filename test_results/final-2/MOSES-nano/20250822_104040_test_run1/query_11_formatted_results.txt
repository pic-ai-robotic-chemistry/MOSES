{'summary': 'Cryptands are macrocyclic, macrobicyclic ligands capable of encapsulating guest molecules, especially anions, and are functionalized with dyes like anthracene and naphthalimide to enhance selectivity.', 'key_points': ['Cryptands are a subclass of macrobicyclic ligands and receptors, known for their ability to encapsulate guest molecules, particularly organic guests.', 'They are functionalized with dyes such as anthracene and naphthalimide, which can be used to achieve selectivity for specific anions like sulfate.', 'Structurally, cryptands are part of the broader macrocyclic and macrocyclic_cavitand classes, often used in host-guest chemistry.', "The property 'has_guest' indicates cryptands typically host organic guests, and their functionalization with dyes suggests applications in sensing or selective binding."], 'background_information': ['Cryptands are a specialized class of macrocyclic compounds designed for selective encapsulation of guest molecules, often in the context of host-guest chemistry and supramolecular assemblies.', 'They are structurally related to other macrocyclic compounds such as calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and resorcinarenes, which also form host cavities but differ in structure and binding properties.', 'The functionalization with dyes like anthracene and naphthalimide not only facilitates detection (e.g., fluorescence signaling) but also enhances selectivity for specific anions, such as sulfate, through tailored binding interactions.', "Cryptands' ability to act as receptors makes them valuable in sensing, separation, and catalysis, with their macrocyclic architecture providing a preorganized cavity that stabilizes guest molecules via non-covalent interactions."], 'relationships': ['Cryptands are a subclass of macrobicyclic ligands and receptors, indicating their structural and functional relationship within macrocyclic chemistry.', 'Their functionalization with dyes links them to applications in sensing and detection, especially for specific anions.', 'The structural hierarchy places cryptands within the broader context of macrocyclic compounds used in host-guest chemistry, with specific properties tailored for selective binding.']}
