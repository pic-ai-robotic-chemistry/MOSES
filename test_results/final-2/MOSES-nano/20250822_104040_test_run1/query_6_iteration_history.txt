[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': 'The query is asking for specific host molecules that participate in host-guest recognition processes within electrochemical assays. This involves identifying molecules capable of selectively binding guest species through non-covalent interactions, which are utilized in electrochemical sensing techniques. The focus is on molecules that serve as hosts—such as macrocycles, receptors, or other recognition entities—that facilitate selective detection in electrochemical contexts. The query implies an interest in understanding which classes of molecules are employed as hosts in such assays, likely including classes like cyclodextrins, crown ethers, calixarenes, and other macrocyclic or supramolecular hosts, especially those with well-characterized recognition properties and electrochemical activity.', 'hypothetical_answer': 'Host molecules used in host-guest recognition within electrochemical assays include a variety of macrocyclic compounds and supramolecular receptors such as cyclodextrins, crown ethers, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and porphyrins. These molecules are designed to selectively bind guest species—such as ions, small organic molecules, or biomolecules—through non-covalent interactions like hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effects, or electrostatic forces. In electrochemical assays, these host molecules are often immobilized on electrode surfaces or incorporated into sensor architectures to enable selective detection of target analytes. For example, cyclodextrins are widely used to recognize hydrophobic organic molecules, while crown ethers are effective for specific metal cations. The recognition event often modulates the electrochemical signal, allowing for sensitive and selective sensing of various analytes.', 'key_concepts': ['Host-guest recognition', 'Electrochemical
