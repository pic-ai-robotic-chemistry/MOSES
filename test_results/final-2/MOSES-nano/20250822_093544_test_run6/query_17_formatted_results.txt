{'summary': 'Cage molecules and macrocycles are both prominent in supramolecular chemistry, with macrocycles primarily used for biomolecular recognition and sensing, while cage molecules are notable for their ability to accommodate specific guest molecules, such as indole rings and methyl groups, in host-guest systems.', 'key_points': ['Macrocycles are extensively applied in biomolecular recognition, sensing, and as components of artificial light-harvesting systems, with properties like intrinsic fluorescence and aromatic surfaces that facilitate host-guest interactions and molecular recognition.', 'Macrocycles serve as supramolecular hosts with higher affinity in specific solvents (e.g., methanol) and are involved in applications such as biomolecule recognition, sensing scaffolds, and nanostructures.', 'Cage molecules are characterized by their capacity to accommodate specific structural motifs such as indole rings and methyl groups, indicating their role in selective encapsulation and molecular recognition.', 'Both classes are integral to supramolecular chemistry, with macrocycles often functioning as hosts in molecular recognition and sensing, while cages are specialized for encapsulation of particular guest molecules, suggesting overlapping uses in targeted molecular encapsulation and recognition systems.'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles are cyclic compounds with a defined cavity, often used as supramolecular hosts due to their ability to bind guest molecules through hydrogen bonding, π-π interactions, and other non-covalent forces. They are key in applications like biomolecular recognition, sensors, and artificial light-harvesting systems, leveraging properties such as intrinsic fluorescence and aromatic surfaces.', 'Macrocycles are classified under broader categories such as supramolecular hosts, fluorescent probes, and functional materials, emphasizing their role in molecular recognition and sensing technologies. Their higher affinity in solvents like methanol indicates their potential in aqueous and organic media for selective binding.', 'Cage molecules, often three-dimensional structures with internal cavities, are designed for selective encapsulation of specific guest molecules, such as indole rings and methyl groups, which are relevant in drug delivery, molecular recognition, and catalysis.', 'Both macrocycles and cages are part of the larger field of supramolecular chemistry, which focuses on non-covalent interactions and self-assembly processes to create functional molecular architectures.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles are used in biomolecular recognition and sensing, often functioning as supramolecular hosts with specific affinity and fluorescence properties.', 'Cage molecules are specialized for accommodating particular guest structures, such as indole rings and methyl groups, indicating their role in selective encapsulation.', 'Both classes contribute to the development of molecular recognition systems, with macrocycles providing a platform for sensing and cages enabling targeted encapsulation, suggesting overlapping applications in targeted delivery and recognition systems.']}
