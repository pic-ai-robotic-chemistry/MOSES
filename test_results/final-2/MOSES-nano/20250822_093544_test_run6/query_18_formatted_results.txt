{'summary': 'Supramolecular hosts that primarily bind anions through anion-π interactions are typically electron-deficient aromatic systems with specific cavity and surface properties designed for anion recognition.', 'key_points': ['The structured data indicates that supramolecular hosts are often designed for biological targets, with a focus on selectivity and weak interactions, suggesting a nuanced approach to anion binding.', 'These hosts are characterized by their small interaction surface area (smaller than proteins), which facilitates specific binding modes such as anion-π interactions.', 'They are often created via de novo design, inspired by natural systems, and are compatible with biologically relevant solvents like warm, salty water, indicating potential for biological applications.', 'Binding affinity to methylated targets and discrimination between methylation states imply that these hosts can recognize specific anionic modifications, which is relevant for anion-π interactions involving electron-deficient aromatic cavities.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are non-covalent interactions where anions are stabilized by electron-deficient π-systems, typically aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing substituents that create a positive electrostatic potential above and below the aromatic plane.', 'Supramolecular hosts designed for anion-π interactions often feature electron-deficient aromatic cavities, such as perfluorinated arenes or other π-acidic systems, which can stabilize anions through electrostatic and dispersion forces.', 'These hosts are used in chemical biology and biochemistry for selective anion recognition, sensing, and sequestration, especially in complex biological environments where solvent compatibility and selectivity are critical.', 'The structural data suggests that these hosts are smaller than proteins, which allows for precise control over binding sites and enhances selectivity for specific anions, including methylated or posttranslationally modified amino acids.', 'Methodologically, the design of such hosts involves de novo molecular engineering, often inspired by natural recognition motifs, and aims to optimize binding affinity and selectivity through structural and electronic tuning.'], 'relationships': ['The data indicates a close relationship between the structural features of supramolecular hosts (electron-deficient aromatic cavities) and their function in anion-π interactions.', 'The design principles are inspired by natural systems, with a focus on mimicking biological recognition processes, such as methylation state discrimination.', "The hosts' small interaction surface area and solvent compatibility are tailored to facilitate specific, high-affinity binding in biologically relevant media, which is essential for practical applications in chemical biology.", 'The structural and functional properties are interconnected, with the electron-deficient cavity being central to the anion-π interaction mechanism, and the design process often involves de novo approaches to achieve desired selectivity and affinity.']}
