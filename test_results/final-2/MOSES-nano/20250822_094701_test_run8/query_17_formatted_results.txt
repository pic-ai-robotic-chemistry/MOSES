{'summary': 'Cage molecules are primarily used for guest encapsulation and accommodating specific groups, while macrocycles are employed in molecular recognition, host-guest chemistry, and biomedical applications such as cancer diagnosis. Overlapping uses include biomolecule recognition and supramolecular host functions, indicating some shared roles in molecular recognition and guest binding.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules can accommodate groups like indole rings and methyl groups, with applications in guest encapsulation and molecular recognition.', 'Macrocycles exhibit properties such as pi-pi stacking, hydrogen bonding, and guest exchange control, with applications in biomolecule recognition, cancer diagnosis, and supramolecular host systems.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles can form inclusion complexes, bind peptides, and serve as platforms for multivalent systems, indicating overlapping roles in host-guest chemistry and molecular recognition.'], 'background_information': ['Cage molecules are often characterized by their ability to host guest molecules within a confined cavity, with specific restrictions on the accommodated groups (e.g., indole rings, methyl groups). They are used in applications like guest encapsulation, guest exchange processes, and sensing scaffolds, with some structures designed for biomedical applications such as gynecologic cancer diagnosis.\n\nMacrocycles are large, cyclic molecules with defined pi-pi stacking interactions, hydrogen bonding capabilities, and hydrophobic cavities. They are extensively used in supramolecular chemistry for molecular recognition, including binding amino acids, peptides, and biomolecules, and are integral to artificial light-harvesting systems and nanostructures.\n\nBoth classes are involved in host-guest chemistry, with macrocycles often serving as supramolecular hosts that can form inclusion complexes, while cages are more versatile in accommodating various guest groups. Their structural features, such as aromatic rings, hydrophobic cavities, and functional groups, underpin their applications in sensing, drug delivery, and molecular recognition.\n\nMethodologically, macrocycles are often synthesized via reactions like S_N_ar, and their properties are characterized by spectroscopy (NMR, IR, HRMS). Cage molecules are typically prepared through condensation reactions under specific conditions, emphasizing their structural rigidity or flexibility depending on design.\n\nThe overlapping applications highlight their roles in biomolecular recognition, sensing, and nanostructure assembly, with macrocycles often providing the functional framework for high-affinity binding and cage molecules offering encapsulation and selective guest accommodation.'], 'relationships': ['Both cage molecules and macrocycles serve as supramolecular hosts, forming inclusion complexes with guest molecules.', 'Macrocycles and cages can be integrated into nanostructures and sensing scaffolds, indicating their roles in nanotechnology and biosensing.', 'Shared applications include biomolecule recognition, guest binding, and use as platforms for multivalent systems, reflecting their importance in molecular recognition and host-guest chemistry.', 'Structural features such as aromatic rings, hydrophobic cavities, and hydrogen bonding units are common to both, facilitating their overlapping functions in molecular recognition and guest encapsulation.']}
