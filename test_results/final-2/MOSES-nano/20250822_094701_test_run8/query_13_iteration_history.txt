[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': "The query is asking about the types of molecules that typically serve as 'guest' species in supramolecular host-guest chemistry. This involves understanding the classes of molecules that can be encapsulated or associated with host molecules such as cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, or other macrocyclic hosts. The question aims to identify common guest molecules—often small organic compounds, ions, or biomolecules—that interact non-covalently with these hosts. The tool analysis suggests that relevant classes include 'guest molecules,' 'supramolecular hosts,' and related subclasses, with some classes containing extensive information about molecular interactions, binding affinities, and structural features, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding.", 'hypothetical_answer': 'In supramolecular chemistry, guest molecules that typically act as guests for hosts include small organic compounds such as aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene, naphthalene), alcohols, amines, and other neutral organic molecules. Ions like cations (e.g., Na+, K+) and anions (e.g., Cl−, SO4^2−) also serve as guests, especially in ionophore systems. Biomolecules such as amino acids, peptides, and nucleotides can act as guests in biological host systems. These molecules are characterized by their ability to engage in non-covalent interactions—hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, van der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions—with the host. The specific affinity depends on the size, shape, and functional groups of the guest, as well as the cavity size and chemical environment of the host molecule. Common classes of guest molecules include hydrophobic organic compounds, charged ions, and biologically relevant molecules, all of which can be selectively encapsulated or associated with macrocyclic hosts to form stable supramolecular complexes.', 'key_concepts': ['supramolecular host-guest chemistry', 'guest molecules', 'macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils)',
