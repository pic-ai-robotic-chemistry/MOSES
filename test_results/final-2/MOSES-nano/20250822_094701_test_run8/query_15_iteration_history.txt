[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': 'The query is asking about the specific non-covalent interactions that occur when a calixarene molecule, which has pyrrole groups attached, binds to an anion. It seeks to understand the types of intermolecular forces involved in this host-guest chemistry, particularly focusing on the nature of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, π–π stacking, or other relevant forces. The mention of calixarene and pyrrole groups suggests a focus on supramolecular chemistry, macrocyclic host-guest interactions, and the role of functional groups in anion recognition. The tool analysis indicates that relevant classes include macrocyclic compounds, calixarenes, pyrrole derivatives, and non-covalent interaction types, which are rich sources of detailed information for constructing a comprehensive answer.', 'hypothetical_answer': 'When a calixarene containing pyrrole groups binds an anion, the primary non-covalent interactions involved are hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The pyrrole NH groups can serve as hydrogen bond donors, forming hydrogen bonds with the anion, stabilizing the complex. Additionally, the aromatic rings of the calixarene can participate in π–π interactions or cation–π interactions if cationic species are involved, but primarily, electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged anion and the electron-deficient regions of the host plays a key role. The calixarene’s macrocyclic cavity provides a hydrophobic environment that can enhance binding affinity through van der Waals forces. Overall, the binding involves a combination of hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, and possibly π–π interactions, depending on the specific structure of the calixarene and the nature of the anion.', 'key_concepts': ['Calixarene', 'Pyrrole derivatives', 'Anion recognition', 'Non-covalent interactions', 'Hydrogen bonding', 'Electrostatic interactions', 'Host-guest chemistry', 'Macrocyclic compounds', 'Supramolecular chemistry', 'π–π stacking'], 'tool_analysis': {'detected_terms': [], 'class_candidates': {}, 'richness_evaluations': {}}}, 'refined_classes': None, 'normalized_query': NormalizedQuery(intent='Identify the non-covalent interactions involved in calixarene binding an anion', relevant_entities=['calixarene', 'pyrrole', 'anion', 'hydrogen_bond', 'electrostatic_interaction', 'pi-pi_interaction', 'host-guest_chemistry', 'macrocyclic_compound', 'supramolecular_chemistry'], relevant_properties=[], filters=None, query_type_suggestion='chemical_interaction'), 'query_strategy': 'tool_sequence', 'execution_plan': ToolPlan(steps=[ToolCallStep(tool='get_class_info', params={'class_names': 'calixarene'}), ToolCallStep(tool='get_class_info', params={'class_names': 'anion'})]), 'sparql_query': None, 'query_results': {'results': [{'tool': 'get_class_info', 'params': {'class_names': 'calixarene'}, 'result': {'calixarene': {'name': 'calixarene', 'information': ['Calixarenes and Resorcinarenes as Scaffolds for Supramolecular Metallo-Enzyme Mimicry.', 'Many concave host systems have been developed to target biological binding partners: macrocyclic cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and calixarenes, as well as various C-shaped tweezers and clips, all have inherent advantages and disadvantages.', 'Calixarenes are a class of macrocyclic compounds widely used in host-guest chemistry.', 'Calixarenes are a family of macrocyclic compounds used as host molecules in host-guest chemistry, particularly effective for binding methylated biological targets.', 'Calixarenes are macrocyclic compounds that are able to disrupt the binding between the natural histone binder CHD4_PHD2 and histone H3K9me3 in vitro.', 'Calixarene is a type of macrocyclic compound that forms complexes with ethidium bromide.', 'Calixarenes are m-cyclophanes with a specific cavity size and are used as molecular hosts.', 'Calixarenes are a class of compounds whose solubility in water was improved by the synthesis of p-sulfonatocalix(n)arene macrocycles.', 'LPA protons underwent upfield shifts upon addition of GC5A (Figures 2a-c) due to the ring current effect of the aromatic nuclei of calixarenes.', 'The conformation of the calixarene host is of crucial importance for its inclusion behaviour.', 'Some classical synthetic supramolecular macrocyclic hosts, including crown ethers, cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, have been elaborately modified to efficiently interact with a manifold of substrates from metal ions, neutral molecules to organic cations and anions in aqueous solution.', 'Calixarenes are a class of molecules studied for their ability to act as receptors.', 'A broad range of synthetic ammonium ion receptors have been reported such as cyclic peptides, crown ethers, calixarenes and cyclodextrins.', 'Calixarenes are a type of receptor that has been designed and whose binding features have been extensively examined.', 'Calixarene refers to a class of macrocyclic molecules, including SC4, SC6, and SC8, that interact with ET in aqueous solution.', 'Calixarenes are a class of macrocyclic compounds related to cavitands, discussed in the context of their chronology and development.', 'Calixarenes are a class of macrocyclic compounds widely studied in chemistry for their ability to form host-guest complexes.', 'Calixarenes and their derivatives are rather easy to synthesize and some show remarkable bioactivity.', 'Calixarenes are compounds that inhibit methylated histone-plant homeodomain complexes, as described in the referenced journal article.', 'Calixarenes are another class of frequently used host molecules in supramolecular chemistry, alongside cyclodextrins and cucurbit(n)urils.', 'Calixarenes are macrocyclic receptors reported for amino acid and aromatic peptide complexation and recognition.', 'Calixarenes have hydrophobic cavity that can retain small molecules or ions through non-covalent interactions.', 'Some examples of important and frequently used receptors are cyclodextrins, calixarenes and cucurbit(n)urils.', 'Cationπ and ππ interactions occur between the guanidinium group of arginine and the aromatic rings in the cavity of the calixarene.', 'The analyte complexes in a parallel position to the calixarenes, as it can be observed by the two top complexes;
