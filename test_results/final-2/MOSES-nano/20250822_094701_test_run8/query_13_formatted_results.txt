{'summary': 'Molecules that typically act as guests in supramolecular host-guest chemistry include macrocyclic compounds such as cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and cucurbiturils, which form inclusion complexes primarily through hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonding, and π-π interactions.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules often possess hydrophobic regions, functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding, and aromatic moieties that facilitate π-π interactions.', 'Common guest molecules include organic compounds with aromatic or hydrophobic characteristics, as well as ionic species that can interact with macrocyclic hosts.', 'Host molecules like cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and cucurbiturils are designed to encapsulate these guests via non-covalent interactions, with binding driven by hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions.'], 'background_information': ["Supramolecular host-guest chemistry involves non-covalent interactions between a host molecule, often macrocyclic, and a guest molecule. The host's cavity size, shape, and functional groups determine its selectivity.", 'Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides with hydrophobic cavities suitable for encapsulating hydrophobic and aromatic molecules, often used in drug delivery and sensing.', 'Calixarenes are macrocyclic phenolic compounds with adjustable cavities that can bind a variety of organic molecules and ions, often through π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding.', 'Cucurbiturils are pumpkin-shaped macrocycles with hydrophobic cavities and carbonyl-lined portals, capable of binding cationic and neutral guests with high affinity, often stabilized by ion-dipole interactions.', 'The binding mechanisms are influenced by the size and polarity of the guest, the nature of the host cavity, and the environmental conditions such as solvent and pH.'], 'relationships': ['The structural features of guest molecules, such as aromaticity and hydrophobicity, directly influence their affinity for macrocyclic hosts.', 'Host molecules like cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and cucurbiturils are often selected based on the size and chemical nature of the guest.', 'The interactions include hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and electrostatic interactions, which collectively determine the stability and specificity of the host-guest complex.']}
