{'summary': 'Several classes of supramolecular hosts are known to bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions, notably calixarene, pillararene, calix(n)arene, and molecular tweezer derivatives, which feature electron-rich cavities and functional groups capable of engaging in cation-π interactions.', 'key_points': ['Calixarene: Recognized as a synthetic receptor and macrocyclic host, calixarene exhibits cation-π interaction capabilities primarily through electron-rich aromatic units and can be functionalized with cationic groups. It demonstrates high host-guest property excellence, easy charge transfer, and is used in drug detection, drug release, and nanocapsulation (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Pillararene: Identified as a synthetic receptor and macrocycle, pillararene features an electron-rich cavity with cation-π interaction potential, especially with amine groups. It is used for recognition of methylated lysine, with high affinity and water solubility when appropriately functionalized (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Calix(n)arene: A subclass of calixarene with n aromatic units, calix(n)arene has a defined cavity, phenolic groups, and electron-withdrawing substituents that modulate acidity and binding affinity. It is structurally related to calixarene and can recognize methylated lysine via cation-π interactions.', 'Resorcinarene: A macrocyclic receptor capable of entering liposomes and involved in molecular recognition systems, it binds methylated lysine and features phenolic units and methylene bridges that contribute to its cavity and binding properties.', 'Molecular Tweezer: Comprising components like crown ether and PBI dye, molecular tweezers form self-assembled dimers with pocket-like, electron-rich aromatic binding sites, and exhibit high affinity for peptides with lysine or arginine, engaging in cation-π interactions.'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are noncovalent, attractive interactions between a cation and the face of an electron-rich aromatic system, playing a crucial role in molecular recognition within supramolecular chemistry. Hosts with electron-rich cavities, such as calixarenes, pillararenes, and calix(n)arenes, are particularly suited for binding cationic guests through these interactions.', 'Calixarene and calix(n)arene are macrocyclic compounds with phenolic units that can be functionalized to enhance cation-π interactions, often used in biomedical applications, sensors, and drug delivery systems. Their ability to be readily modified with cationic groups makes them versatile for specific guest recognition.', 'Pillararene features electron-rich aromatic units arranged in a pillar-like structure, enabling selective recognition of cationic species, especially methylated lysine, via cation-π interactions.', 'Molecular tweezers are designed to mimic biological recognition processes, with pocket-like aromatic surfaces that facilitate cation-π interactions with lysine and arginine residues in peptides or proteins, often used in sensing and molecular recognition applications.', 'The properties such as cavity size, electron density, and functional group decoration critically influence the strength and selectivity of cation-π interactions in these hosts. Quantitative measures like high host-guest property excellence, high affinity, and ease of synthesis are indicative of their effectiveness.', 'The structural features, such as the presence of phenolic groups, methylene bridges, and electron-withdrawing substituents, modulate acidity and binding affinity, enabling fine-tuning of host-guest interactions for specific applications.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarene, calix(n)arene, and resorcinarene are structurally related macrocyclic hosts with phenolic units that facilitate cation-π interactions.', 'Pillararene and calixarene derivatives are both synthetic macrocyclic hosts with electron-rich cavities, capable of engaging in cation-π interactions with guest molecules such as methylated lysine.', 'Molecular tweezers utilize pocket-like, aromatic, electron-rich binding sites, forming self-assembled dimers that can recognize peptides with lysine or arginine residues via cation-π interactions.', 'Functionalization with cationic groups enhances the ability of these hosts to bind positively charged guests through cation-π interactions, which is critical in applications like drug detection, sensing, and molecular recognition.']}
