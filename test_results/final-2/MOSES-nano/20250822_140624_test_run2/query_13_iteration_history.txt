[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': "The query is asking about the types of molecules that can serve as 'guests' in supramolecular chemistry, meaning molecules that are encapsulated or bound by 'host' molecules to form non-covalent complexes. The question seeks to identify common or typical guest molecules, which could include various classes such as organic, inorganic, or biomolecules. The use of the term 'types of molecules' suggests an interest in the chemical nature, size, or functional groups that facilitate host-guest interactions. Based on tool analysis, relevant classes likely include 'guest molecules,' 'supramolecular hosts,' and related subclasses, with an emphasis on those with rich informational content about their properties and interaction modes.", 'hypothetical_answer': 'In supramolecular chemistry, typical guest molecules include a variety of compounds that can non-covalently interact with host molecules. Common guests are organic molecules such as aromatic compounds (e.g., benzene, naphthalene), alkaloids, and other hydrophobic molecules that fit into the cavity of hosts like cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, and calixarenes. Inorganic guests may include metal ions or small inorganic complexes that coordinate within host cavities. Biomolecules such as amino acids, peptides, or nucleotides can also act as guests, especially in biological supramolecular systems. The key features enabling guest binding include size complementarity, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding capacity, and electrostatic interactions. The most effective guest molecules are those with structural features that allow multiple non-covalent interactions, facilitating stable host-guest complexes.', 'key_concepts': ['Host-guest
