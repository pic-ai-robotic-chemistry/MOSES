[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': 'The query is asking for categories or types of supramolecular host molecules that are known to bind anions predominantly via anion-π interactions. This involves identifying classes of host compounds—such as macrocyclic hosts, cage-like structures, or other supramolecular assemblies—that have been documented to utilize anion-π interactions as a primary binding mechanism. The focus is on understanding which host architectures and functional features facilitate this specific non-covalent interaction, supported by existing chemical literature and class definitions.', 'hypothetical_answer': 'Supramolecular hosts that primarily bind anions through anion-π interactions include classes such as electron-deficient aromatic macrocycles (e.g., perfluorinated porphyrins, coronenes, and other π-acidic aromatic systems), cage-like hosts with electron-deficient aromatic panels, and certain macrocyclic hosts designed with π-acidic surfaces. These hosts typically feature electron-deficient aromatic rings or surfaces that can engage in favorable electrostatic and π-interactions with negatively charged anions. Notably, perfluorinated aromatic systems and specially designed π-acidic macrocycles have demonstrated selective anion binding via anion-π interactions, as evidenced by structural and spectroscopic studies documented in the literature.', 'key_concepts': ['Supramolecular chemistry', 'Anion-π interactions', 'Electron-deficient aromatic systems', 'Macrocyclic hosts', 'Cage-like host structures',

The current results provide extensive information on these communities, especially macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils, calixarenes, cyclodextrins, and resorcinarenes, including their structures, binding capabilities, and applications in host-guest chemistry. The coverage of macrocyclic hosts is detailed, with specific examples and their binding properties. The supramolecular chemistry community is broadly covered, with relevant subfields like host-guest binding and recognition also addressed. However, the specific focus on anion-π interactions is not explicitly covered in the current results, which is a critical gap. The communities related to the mechanisms of anion-π interactions, and specific host types known for such interactions, are missing. Cross-community relationships, such as how different macrocyclic hosts facilitate anion-π interactions, are not explicitly detailed. The overall information is sufficient to understand the types of macrocyclic hosts generally used in supramolecular chemistry, but it does not directly address which of these are known to bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions.
