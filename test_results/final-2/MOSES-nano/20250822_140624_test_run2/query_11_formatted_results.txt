{'summary': 'A cryptand is a macrocyclic ligand, often macrobicyclic, designed to encapsulate guest molecules, particularly organic guests, and can be functionalized with dyes such as anthracene and naphthalimide for selective anion recognition.', 'key_points': ['Cryptands are macrocyclic compounds, specifically macrobicyclic ligands, capable of encapsulating guest molecules in host-guest chemistry.', 'They are functionalized with dyes like anthracene and naphthalimide to achieve selectivity for specific anions such as sulfate.', 'Cryptands are subclasses of macrobicyclic ligands and receptors, with their ability to encapsulate guest molecules being central to their function.'], 'background_information': ['Cryptands are a class of macrobicyclic ligands known for their ability to encapsulate guest molecules, especially in host-guest chemistry applications. They are often functionalized with dyes such as anthracene and naphthalimide to enhance selectivity for specific anions like sulfate. As a subclass of macrobicyclic ligands, cryptands can act as receptors for organic guests and are used in various fields including molecular recognition, chemosensing, and host-guest complexation. Their macrocyclic structure provides a defined cavity that facilitates selective binding through non-covalent interactions, and their functionalization with dyes allows for optical detection and sensing. They are also related to other macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and cyclodextrins, but are distinguished by their macrobicyclic architecture and encapsulation capabilities.'], 'relationships': ['Cryptands are a subclass of macrobicyclic ligands and receptors.', 'They are functionalized with dyes such as anthracene and naphthalimide to achieve selectivity for specific anions.', 'Cryptands encapsulate guest molecules within their macrocyclic cavity, functioning as host molecules in host-guest chemistry.', 'They are used for selective recognition of organic guests and anions, including sulfate.', 'Cryptands are related to other macrocyclic hosts like cucurbiturils and calixarenes, but are characterized by their macrobicyclic structure and encapsulation ability.']}
