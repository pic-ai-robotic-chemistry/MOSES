{'summary': 'IDA (Information-Dependent Acquisition) can detect a broad spectrum of molecules including biomolecules such as carbohydrates, metabolites, nucleic acids, and proteins, as well as metal ions and small organic molecules, with detection capabilities influenced by specific coordination sphere properties and competitive binding conditions.', 'key_points': ['Biomolecules detectable by IDA include carbohydrate, metabolite, nucleic acid, and protein classes, characterized by hydrophobicity and diverse structural features.', 'Metal ions are detectable by IDA when they possess a first coordination sphere, which is restricted to single coordination sphere configurations, with detection influenced by their concentration (e.g., 100-fold excess) and tuning of Lewis acidity via the first coordination sphere.', 'Metal ion detection is affected by their binding constant (moderate in competitive water medium) and their competition with solvent molecules, which can displace or compete for binding sites.', 'Small organic molecules are also detectable by IDA, although specific structural or property details are not provided in the results.', 'The detection of biomolecules, metal ions, and small organic molecules by IDA is supported by their classification as analytes or molecules, with metal ions further characterized by their substrate relationship and coordination properties.'], 'background_information': ['IDAs are analytical techniques that rely on the specific binding interactions between target molecules and detection probes, often used in mass spectrometry and chromatography to identify and quantify molecules based on their unique properties.', 'Biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and metabolites are common targets in IDA due to their distinct chemical and physical characteristics, including hydrophobicity and specific functional groups.', 'Metal ions are detectable by IDA when they form stable complexes with ligands, with their detection sensitivity influenced by their coordination sphere, concentration, and competition with solvent molecules.', 'Small organic molecules, which include a wide range of low molecular weight compounds, are detectable by IDA, often based on their unique structural features and reactivity.', 'The properties of metal ions, such as their coordination sphere and Lewis acidity, are critical in their detection, with detection efficiency affected by factors like concentration, binding constants, and competitive interactions with solvents.'], 'relationships': ['The detection of metal ions by IDA depends on their first coordination sphere and their ability to form stable complexes, which can be tuned by their Lewis acidity and concentration.', 'Biomolecules are classified into different types (carbohydrate, metabolite, nucleic acid, protein) with distinct hydrophobicity profiles, influencing their detectability.', 'Small organic molecules are a broad class detectable by IDA, though specific properties are not detailed, implying a wide detection scope.', 'Metal ions are often in competition with solvent molecules for binding sites, affecting their detection and stability of complexes.', 'The properties of metal ions, such as their coordination sphere and binding constants, directly influence their detectability and the nature of their complexes in IDA.']}
