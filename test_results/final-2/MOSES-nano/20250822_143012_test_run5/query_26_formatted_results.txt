{'summary': 'Supramolecular hosts known to bind primarily through cation-π interactions include calixarenes, cavitands, and cucurbiturils, especially cucurbit(6), cucurbit(7), and cucurbit(8)uril, which exhibit specific affinity for cationic and electron-deficient guests via π-electron-rich cavities and cation-π interactions.', 'key_points': ['Calix(4)_arene, calix(6)arene, calix(8)arene, and calix(n)arene are macrocyclic hosts with cavities capable of engaging in cation-π interactions, especially when functionalized with phenolic groups and aromatic units.', 'Cavitands are host molecules with cavities that can encapsulate guest molecules, with some designed to facilitate cation-π interactions, as indicated by their recognition of methylated lysines and amino acids.', 'Cucurbiturils, including cucurbit(6), cucurbit(7), and cucurbit(8)uril, are macrocyclic hosts that form high-affinity complexes with amino acids, peptides, and methylated lysines, often involving cation-π interactions, with binding affinities reaching nanomolar levels.', 'Cucurbiturils exhibit specific recognition of methylated lysines and arginines, with binding affinities in the nanomolar range, and are used in aqueous solutions for molecular recognition and host-guest chemistry.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as pillararenes and cyclodextrins are also relevant, with some capable of engaging in cation-π interactions, but cucurbiturils are particularly noted for their strong affinity and specificity for cationic guests via π-electron-rich portals and cavities.', 'The structural features of these hosts, including their cavity size, symmetry, and functional groups, are critical for their ability to engage in cation-π interactions, with specific examples showing binding constants of 10^4 to 10^6 M^-1 for methylated amino acids and peptides.', 'The recognition of methylated lysines and arginines by cucurbiturils and calixarenes involves cation-π interactions facilitated by aromatic and electron-rich groups within the host cavities.', 'Cucurbiturils, especially cucurbit(6), cucurbit(7), and cucurbit(8)uril, are extensively studied for their ability to form high-affinity complexes with cationic guests through cation-π interactions, with binding affinities often in the nanomolar range, and are used in biological and biochemical applications.', 'Calixarenes and cavitands are also capable of engaging in cation-π interactions, especially when functionalized with aromatic groups, and are used for recognition of neurotransmitters, peptides, and other cationic species.'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are non-covalent interactions between a cation and the π-electron cloud of an aromatic or electron-rich host, playing a significant role in molecular recognition, host-guest chemistry, and biological systems.', 'Calixarenes, cavitands, and cucurbiturils are prominent classes of macrocyclic hosts in supramolecular chemistry, with structures designed to provide cavities and portals that facilitate specific interactions, including cation-π interactions.', 'Cucurbiturils, especially cucurbit(6), cucurbit(7), and cucurbit(8)uril, are known for their high binding affinities for cationic and electron-deficient guests, often involving cation-π interactions at their carbonyl-rich portals and within their hydrophobic cavities.', 'The binding affinity in these systems can reach up to 10^4 to 10^6 M^-1, with binding mechanisms often entropy-driven or enthalpy-driven depending on the guest and host structure.', 'Functionalization of calixarenes with phenolic groups and aromatic units enhances their ability to participate in cation-π interactions, making them suitable for recognition of methylated lysines, neurotransmitters, and other biologically relevant cationic molecules.', 'Cavitands, derived from resorcinarenes, are designed to encapsulate guest molecules and can be tailored to facilitate cation-π interactions, especially when aromatic walls or functional groups are present.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as pillararenes and cyclodextrins also participate in cation-π interactions, but cucurbiturils are distinguished by their high affinity and selectivity for cationic guests, making them particularly valuable in sensing, drug delivery, and biochemical recognition.', "The structural features, including cavity size, symmetry, and the presence of aromatic or electron-rich groups, are critical determinants of the host's ability to bind guests via cation-π interactions.", 'Methodologies such as NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and X-ray crystallography are used to characterize host-guest complexes and quantify binding affinities, often revealing the importance of π-electron-rich environments in binding mechanisms.'], 'relationships': ['Cucurbit(6), cucurbit(7), and cucurbit(8)uril are part of the cucurbituril family, characterized by their high symmetry, rigid macrocyclic structure, and portals rich in carbonyl groups that facilitate cation-π interactions.', 'Calix(4)_arene, calix(6)arene, calix(8)arene, and calix(n)arene are macrocyclic hosts with phenolic groups and aromatic units, capable of engaging in cation-π interactions, especially when functionalized with aromatic substituents.', 'Cavitands are derived from resorcinarenes and can be tailored to include aromatic walls or functional groups that promote cation-π interactions, recognizing methylated lysines and amino acids.', 'The affinity constants (e.g., 10^4 to 10^6 M^-1) for methylated lysines and arginines indicate strong cation-π interactions, especially in cucurbiturils and calixarenes.', "Structural features such as cavity size (e.g., 8.8 Å internal diameter for cucurbiturils), symmetry (e.g., C_v_4, C_v_2), and functional groups (e.g., aromatic rings, carbonyl portals) are directly related to the host's ability to bind guests via cation-π interactions.", 'Methodologies like NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry, and X-ray crystallography are interconnected in characterizing the binding modes and quantifying the strength of cation-π interactions in these host-guest systems.']}
