{'summary': 'Macrocycles are large, cyclic molecules used as hosts in supramolecular chemistry, with diverse structural classes such as calixarenes, cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and resorcinarenes, each exhibiting specific binding properties, cavity sizes, and applications.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes are macrocyclic compounds with a hydrophobic cavity, used as synthetic receptors for amino acids, peptides, and ions, with solubility modulated by sulfonation and derivatization.', 'Cucurbiturils are highly symmetric, rigid macrocyclic molecules with a fixed conformation, capable of high-affinity binding and catalysis, used in drug delivery, molecular recognition, and host-guest chemistry.', 'Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides with a bowl-shaped cavity, extensively studied for their ability to form inclusion complexes with organic molecules, amino acids, and drugs, driven mainly by hydrophobic effects.', 'Resorcinarenes are macrocyclic arenes derived from resorcinol, featuring a cavity suitable for molecular recognition, with properties influenced by substituents such as alkyl groups and electron-withdrawing groups.', 'Macrocyclic hosts generally exhibit high symmetry, rigidity, and the ability to encapsulate a wide range of guest molecules, with cavity sizes ranging from small to large, and are used in applications including chemosensing, drug delivery, and molecular architecture.', 'Structural features such as cavity size (large, bowl-shaped, 9.1 Å height), hydrophobicity, and the presence of functional groups (phenol, cyano, alkyl) are critical for their binding selectivity and application efficacy.', 'Macrocyclic systems are developed to improve therapeutic efficacy, reduce side effects, and control drug release, exemplified by cucurbituril-based systems.'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles are fundamental in supramolecular chemistry, serving as hosts for molecular recognition, encapsulation, and catalysis.', 'Calixarenes, cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and resorcinarenes are among the most studied macrocyclic hosts, each with unique structural features and binding mechanisms.', 'Calixarenes and resorcinarenes are often synthesized via acid-catalyzed condensation, with their cavity properties tunable through rim modifications and substituents.', 'Cucurbiturils are synthesized through controlled homologation, with their high symmetry and rigid structure enabling high selectivity and affinity for specific guests.', 'Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides derived from starch, with a hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic exterior, facilitating their use in drug delivery and sensing.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are characterized by their fixed conformations, high symmetry, and ability to form stable host-guest complexes, often studied using spectroscopic and calorimetric methods.', 'Applications span from biomedical (drug delivery, biomolecule recognition) to environmental (pollutant removal) and materials science (molecular architectures, sensors).'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes, cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and resorcinarenes are subclasses of macrocyclic hosts, each with distinct cavity sizes, binding affinities, and applications.', 'Structural modifications such as rim derivatization, substitution with functional groups (cyano, sulfonate, alkyl), and synthesis conditions influence the binding properties and solubility of macrocycles.', 'Macrocyclic hosts like cucurbiturils and calixarenes are often used in supramolecular assemblies, drug delivery systems, and molecular recognition platforms.', 'Cavity size (large, bowl-shaped, 9.1 Å height) and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance are key determinants of guest selectivity and application scope.', 'Macrocyclic systems are developed to enhance therapeutic efficacy, reduce side effects, and enable controlled drug release, with cucurbituril-based systems being prominent examples.']}
