[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': 'The query is asking about the specific non-covalent interactions that occur when a calixarene molecule, which has pyrrole groups attached, binds to an anion. The user seeks detailed insight into the types of intermolecular forces involved in this host-guest chemistry, likely focusing on interactions such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and possibly π-π or van der Waals forces. The mention of calixarene and pyrrole suggests a focus on macrocyclic host-guest complexes, with an emphasis on how the pyrrole groups contribute to binding. The tool analysis indicates that relevant classes include calixarene derivatives, pyrrole-containing compounds, and anion-binding interactions, which are rich in information about non-covalent forces involved in such complexes.', 'hypothetical_answer': "When a calixarene bearing pyrrole groups binds an anion, several non-covalent interactions typically facilitate the binding process. The primary interactions include hydrogen bonds formed between the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms of the pyrrole rings and the anion, providing directional and strong electrostatic stabilization. Additionally, electrostatic interactions occur between the negatively charged anion and the electron-deficient regions of the host, especially if the calixarene cavity is positively polarized or contains electron-deficient aromatic systems. The aromatic pyrrole rings can also engage in π-anion interactions, where the electron-rich π-systems stabilize the anion through non-covalent π-π or ion-π interactions. Van der Waals forces contribute to the overall stabilization by optimizing the close packing of the host and guest. In some cases, the calixarene's conformational flexibility allows for an optimal binding pocket, enhancing these interactions. Overall, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, π-interactions, and van der Waals forces collectively contribute to the high affinity and selectivity of the calixarene-pyrrole host for anions.", 'key_concepts': ['Calixarene derivatives', 'Pyrrole-containing compounds', 'Anion binding', 'Non-covalent interactions', 'Hydrogen bonding', 'Electrostatic interactions', 'π-anion interactions', 'Van der Waals forces', 'Host-guest chemistry', 'Macrocyclic hosts'], 'tool_analysis': {'detected_terms': [], 'class_candidates': {}, 'richness_evaluations': {}}}, 'refined_classes': None, 'normalized_query': NormalizedQuery(intent='Identify non-covalent interactions involved in calixarene-pyrrole binding to anions', relevant_entities=['calixarene', 'pyrrole', 'anion', 'hydrogen_bond', 'electrostatic_interaction', 'pi-pi_interaction', 'van_der_waals_interaction'], relevant_properties=[], filters=None, query_type_suggestion='chemical_interaction'), 'query_strategy': 'tool_sequence', 'execution_plan': ToolPlan(steps=[ToolCallStep(tool='get_class_info', params={'class_names': 'calixarene'}), ToolCallStep(tool='get_class_info', params={'class_names': 'pyrrole'}), ToolCallStep(tool='get_class_info', params={'class_names': 'anion'}), ToolCallStep(tool='get_related_classes', params={'class_names': 'calixarene'}), ToolCallStep(tool='get_related_classes', params={'class_names': 'pyrrole'}), ToolCallStep(tool='get_related_classes', params={'class_names': 'anion'})]), 'sparql_query': None, 'query_results': {'results': [{'tool': 'get_class_info', 'params': {'class_names': 'calixarene'}, 'result': {'calixarene': {'name': 'calixarene', 'information': ['Calixarenes are a class of molecules studied for their ability to act as receptors.', 'Calixarenes are another class of frequently used host molecules in supramolecular chemistry, alongside cyclodextrins and cucurbit(n)urils.', 'Calixarenes are a class of macrocyclic compounds related to cavitands, discussed in the context of their chronology and development.', 'Macrocyclic arenes including calixarenes, resorcinarenes, cyclotriveratrylenes, pillararenes, and their analogues have become one kind of the most extensively studied synthetic macrocyclic hosts for their potential applications in the fields of biology, environment, and materials science.', 'Some classical synthetic supramolecular macrocyclic hosts, including crown ethers, cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, have been elaborately modified to efficiently interact with a manifold of substrates from metal ions, neutral molecules to organic cations and anions in aqueous solution.', 'Calixarene refers to a class of macrocyclic molecules, including SC4, SC6, and SC8, that interact with ET in aqueous solution.', 'Calixarenes are defined as a class of cyclic oligonuclear phenolic compounds that have shown great potential as multifunctional synthetic receptors in various fields.', 'Calixarenes have hydrophobic cavity that can retain small molecules or ions through non-covalent interactions.', 'Calixarenes are a type of receptor that has been designed and whose binding features have been extensively examined.', 'Calixarenes are compounds that inhibit methylated histone-plant homeodomain complexes, as described in the referenced journal article.', 'The conformation of the calixarene host is of crucial importance for its inclusion behaviour.', 'Calixarenes are a class of compounds whose solubility in water was improved by the synthesis of p-sulfonatocalix(n)arene macrocycles.', 'Calixarenes are a family of macrocyclic compounds used as host molecules in host-guest chemistry, particularly effective for binding methylated biological targets.', 'Calixarenes were employed as the macrocyclic scaffold for the artificial receptor.', 'Calixarenes are a class of macrocyclic compounds known for their ability to bind various molecules, including peptides and proteins.', 'Calixarenes and their derivatives are rather easy to synthesize and some show remarkable bioactivity.', 'LPA protons underwent upfield shifts upon addition of GC5A (Figures 2a-c) due to the ring current effect of the aromatic nuclei of calixarenes.', 'Calixarenes are hosts that confine n-alkanes and haloalkanes in their restricted cavities.', 'Some examples of important and frequently used receptors are cyclodextrins, calixarenes and cucurbit(n)urils.', 'Calixarene is a type of macrocyclic host that has been developed for various applications.', 'The analyte complexes in a parallel position to the calixarenes, as it can be observed by the two top complexes;

calixarene molecule, which has pyrrole groups attached, binds to an anion. The user seeks detailed insight into the types of intermolecular forces involved in this host-guest chemistry, likely focusing on interactions such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and possibly π-π or van der Waals forces. The mention of calixarene and pyrrole suggests a focus on macrocyclic host-guest complexes, with an emphasis on how the pyrrole groups contribute to binding. The tool analysis indicates that relevant classes include calixarene derivatives, pyrrole-containing compounds, and anion-binding interactions, which are rich in information about non-covalent forces involved in such complexes.', 'hypothetical_answer': "When a calixarene bearing pyrrole groups binds an anion, several non-covalent interactions typically facilitate the binding process. The primary interactions include hydrogen bonds formed between the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms of the pyrrole rings and the anion, providing directional and strong electrostatic stabilization. Additionally, electrostatic interactions occur between the negatively charged anion and the electron-deficient regions of the host, especially if the calixarene cavity is positively polarized or contains electron-deficient aromatic systems. The aromatic pyrrole rings can also engage in π-anion interactions, where the electron-rich π-systems stabilize the anion through non-covalent π-π or ion-π interactions. Van der Waals forces contribute to the overall stabilization by optimizing the close packing of the host and guest. In some cases, the calixarene's conformational flexibility allows for an optimal binding pocket, enhancing these interactions. Overall, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, π-interactions, and van der Waals forces collectively contribute to the high affinity and selectivity of the calixarene-pyrrole host for anions.", 'key_concepts': ['Calixarene derivatives', 'Pyrrole-containing compounds', 'Anion binding', 'Non-covalent interactions', 'Hydrogen bonding', 'Electrostatic interactions', 'π-anion interactions', 'Van der Waals forces', 'Host-guest chemistry', 'Macrocyclic hosts'], 'tool_analysis': {'detected_terms': [], 'class_candidates': {}, 'richness_evaluations': {}}}, 'refined_classes': None, 'normalized_query': NormalizedQuery(intent='Identify the non-covalent interactions involved in calixarene binding an anion with pyrrole groups', relevant_entities=['calixarene', 'pyrrole', 'anion', 'hydrogen_bond', 'electrostatic_interaction', 'pi_pi_interaction', 'van_der_waals_interaction'], relevant_properties=[], filters=None, query_type_suggestion='fact-finding'), 'query_strategy': 'tool_sequence', 'execution_plan': ToolPlan(steps=[ToolCallStep(tool='parse_class_definition', params={'class_name': 'calixarene'}), ToolCallStep(tool='parse_class_definition', params={'class_name': 'pyrrole'}), ToolCallStep(tool='parse_class_definition', params={'class_name': 'anion'})]), 'sparql_query': None, 'query_results': {'results': [{'error': "Error executing tool 'parse_class_definition': OntologyTools.parse_class_definition() got an unexpected keyword argument 'class_name'.

The calixarene community is well-covered with extensive structural and functional information, including its role as a receptor and host in supramolecular chemistry. The anion community is also well-documented, with detailed insights into its interaction mechanisms, solvation, and binding behavior. The pyrrole community lacks specific information about its binding modes or interaction capabilities, which is a significant gap. The non-covalent interactions community is partially covered, with explicit mention of Coulombic, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals interactions, but pi-pi interactions are not explicitly linked to calixarene or pyrrole in the current results. Cross-community relationships, such as how calixarene's cavity facilitates hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions with anions, are implied but not explicitly detailed. The structural basis for these interactions, especially in the context of calixarene containing pyrrole groups, is not fully elucidated. Missing communities include detailed molecular interaction mechanisms specific to calixarene-pyrrole complexes and their binding with anions, as well as any potential role of pi-pi interactions.

The user seeks detailed insight into the types of intermolecular forces involved in this host-guest chemistry, likely focusing on interactions such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and possibly π-π or van der Waals forces. The mention of calixarene and pyrrole suggests a focus on macrocyclic host-guest complexes, with an emphasis on how the pyrrole groups contribute to binding. The tool analysis indicates that relevant classes include calixarene derivatives, pyrrole-containing compounds, and anion-binding interactions, which are rich in information about non-covalent forces involved in such complexes.', 'hypothetical_answer': "When a calixarene bearing pyrrole groups binds an anion, several non-covalent interactions typically facilitate the binding process. The primary interactions include hydrogen bonds formed between the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms of the pyrrole rings and the anion, providing directional and strong electrostatic stabilization. Additionally, electrostatic interactions occur between the negatively charged anion and the electron-deficient regions of the host, especially if the calixarene cavity is positively polarized or contains electron-deficient aromatic systems. The aromatic pyrrole rings can also engage in π-anion interactions, where the electron-rich π-systems stabilize the anion through non-covalent π-π or ion-π interactions. Van der Waals forces contribute to the overall stabilization by optimizing the close packing of the host and guest. In some cases, the calixarene's conformational flexibility allows for an optimal binding pocket, enhancing these interactions. Overall, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, π-interactions, and van der Waals forces collectively contribute to the high affinity and selectivity of the calixarene-pyrrole host for anions.", 'key_concepts': ['Calixarene derivatives', 'Pyrrole-containing compounds', 'Anion binding', 'Non-covalent interactions', 'Hydrogen bonding', 'Electrostatic interactions', 'π-anion interactions', 'Van der Waals forces', 'Host-guest chemistry', 'Macrocyclic hosts'], 'tool_analysis': {'detected_terms': [], 'class_candidates': {}, 'richness_evaluations': {}}}, 'refined_classes': None, 'normalized_query': NormalizedQuery(intent='Identify the non-covalent interactions involved in calixarene-pyrrole binding to anions', relevant_entities=['calixarene', 'pyrrole', 'anion', 'hydrogen_bond', 'electrostatic_interaction', 'pi_pi_interaction', 'van_der_waals_interaction'], relevant_properties=[], filters=None, query_type_suggestion='fact-finding'), 'query_strategy': 'tool_sequence', 'execution_plan': ToolPlan(steps=[ToolCallStep(tool='get_class_info', params={'class_names': 'calixarene'}), ToolCallStep(tool='get_class_info', params={'class_names': 'pyrrole'}), ToolCallStep(tool='get_class_info', params={'class_names': 'anion'})]), 'sparql_query': None, 'query_results': {'results': [{'tool': 'get_class_info', 'params': {'class_names': 'calixarene'}, 'result': {'calixarene': {'name': 'calixarene', 'information': ['Calixarenes are a class of molecules studied for their ability to act as receptors.', 'Calixarenes are another class of frequently used host molecules in supramolecular chemistry, alongside cyclodextrins and cucurbit(n)urils.', 'Calixarenes are a class of macrocyclic compounds related to cavitands, discussed in the context of their chronology and development.', 'Macrocyclic arenes including calixarenes, resorcinarenes, cyclotriveratrylenes, pillararenes, and their analogues have become one kind of the most extensively studied synthetic macrocyclic hosts for their potential applications in the fields of biology, environment, and materials science.', 'Some classical synthetic supramolecular macrocyclic hosts, including crown ethers, cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, have been elaborately modified to efficiently interact with a manifold of substrates from metal ions, neutral molecules to organic cations and anions in aqueous solution.', 'Calixarene refers to a class of macrocyclic molecules, including SC4, SC6, and SC8, that interact with ET in aqueous solution.', 'Calixarenes are defined as a class of cyclic oligonuclear phenolic compounds that have shown great potential as multifunctional synthetic receptors in various fields.', 'Calixarenes have hydrophobic cavity that can retain small molecules or ions through non-covalent interactions.', 'Calixarenes are a type of receptor that has been designed and whose binding features have been extensively examined.', 'Calixarenes are compounds that inhibit methylated histone-plant homeodomain complexes, as described in the referenced journal article.', 'The conformation of the calixarene host is of crucial importance for its inclusion behaviour.', 'Calixarenes are a class of compounds whose solubility in water was improved by the synthesis of p-sulfonatocalix(n)arene macrocycles.', 'Calixarenes are a family of macrocyclic compounds used as host molecules in host-guest chemistry, particularly effective for binding methylated biological targets.', 'Calixarenes were employed as the macrocyclic scaffold for the artificial receptor.', 'Calixarenes are a class of macrocyclic compounds known for their ability to bind various molecules, including peptides and proteins.', 'Calixarenes and their derivatives are rather easy to synthesize and some show remarkable bioactivity.', 'LPA protons underwent upfield shifts upon addition of GC5A (Figures 2a-c) due to the ring current effect of the aromatic nuclei of calixarenes.', 'Calixarenes are hosts that confine n-alkanes and haloalkanes in their restricted cavities.', 'Some examples of important and frequently used receptors are cyclodextrins, calixarenes and cucurbit(n)urils.', 'Calixarene is a type of macrocyclic host that has been developed for various applications.', 'The analyte complexes in a parallel position to the calixarenes, as it can be observed by the two top complexes;

The user seeks detailed insight into the types of intermolecular forces involved in this host-guest chemistry, likely focusing on interactions such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and possibly π-π or van der Waals forces. The mention of calixarene and pyrrole suggests a focus on macrocyclic host-guest complexes, with an emphasis on how the pyrrole groups contribute to binding. The tool analysis indicates that relevant classes include calixarene derivatives, pyrrole-containing compounds, and anion-binding interactions, which are rich in information about non-covalent forces involved in such complexes.', 'hypothetical_answer': "When a calixarene bearing pyrrole groups binds an anion, several non-covalent interactions typically facilitate the binding process. The primary interactions include hydrogen bonds formed between the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms of the pyrrole rings and the anion, providing directional and strong electrostatic stabilization. Additionally, electrostatic interactions occur between the negatively charged anion and the electron-deficient regions of the host, especially if the calixarene cavity is positively polarized or contains electron-deficient aromatic systems. The aromatic pyrrole rings can also engage in π-anion interactions, where the electron-rich π-systems stabilize the anion through non-covalent π-π or ion-π interactions. Van der Waals forces contribute to the overall stabilization by optimizing the close packing of the host and guest. In some cases, the calixarene's conformational flexibility allows for an optimal binding pocket, enhancing these interactions. Overall, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, π-interactions, and van der Waals forces collectively contribute to the high affinity and selectivity of the calixarene-pyrrole host for anions.", 'key_concepts': ['Calixarene derivatives', 'Pyrrole-containing compounds', 'Anion binding', 'Non-covalent interactions', 'Hydrogen bonding', 'Electrostatic interactions', 'π-anion interactions', 'Van der Waals forces', 'Host-guest chemistry', 'Macrocyclic hosts'], 'tool_analysis': {'detected_terms': [], 'class_candidates': {}, 'richness_evaluations': {}}}, 'refined_classes': None, 'normalized_query': NormalizedQuery(intent='Identify the non-covalent interactions involved in calixarene binding an anion with pyrrole groups', relevant_entities=['calixarene', 'pyrrole', 'anion', 'hydrogen_bond', 'electrostatic_interaction', 'pi_pi_stacking', 'van_der_waals_interaction'], relevant_properties=[], filters=None, query_type_suggestion='fact-finding'), 'query_strategy': 'tool_sequence', 'execution_plan': ToolPlan(steps=[ToolCallStep(tool='parse_class_definition', params={'class_name': 'calixarene'}), ToolCallStep(tool='get_related_classes', params={'class_names': 'calixarene'})]), 'sparql_query': None, 'query_results': {'results': [{'error': "Error executing tool 'parse_class_definition': OntologyTools.parse_class_definition() got an unexpected keyword argument 'class_name'.

The anion community is also extensively detailed, including various types of anions, their properties, and their interactions with macrocyclic hosts. However, the pyrrole community lacks specific information, which is critical given the question's focus on pyrrole groups in calixarene binding.\n\nThe non-covalent interactions community is implied through references to binding mechanisms, but explicit details about each interaction type (hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, pi-pi, van der Waals) are limited or absent. This gap is significant because the question specifically asks about the types of non-covalent interactions involved.\n\nCross-community relationships are partially established: calixarene's ability to bind anions via non-covalent interactions is implied, but the specific interactions, especially involving pyrrole groups, are not explicitly detailed. The lack of information on pyrrole's role and the specific interactions it participates in during anion binding is a notable gap.\n\nOverall, the current results provide a strong foundation regarding calixarene and anion recognition but are insufficient for a complete answer to the user's question, primarily due to missing details about pyrrole and explicit non-covalent interaction types.\n\nThe user cannot fully answer their question based solely on the current information, as critical details about the specific non-covalent interactions involving pyrrole groups in calixarene binding are missing.", requirements_fulfilled=False), 'timestamp': '2025-08-22T14:20:49.706657', 'messages': [SystemMessage(content='Generated hypothetical document to aid in query understanding: The query is asking about the specific non-covalent interactions that occur when a calixarene molecu...', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='3b28ccd9-2eb4-40d2-bf2f-c0849163ca1b'), SystemMessage(content='Query normalized: When a calixarene containing pyrrole groups binds an anion, what specific non-covalent interactions are typically involved?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='cf208457-3a23-4e40-93e1-2303851ab1dd'), SystemMessage(content='Entity refinement not needed', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='71f2acd6-2f3e-4167-a867-5354d7c62e30'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5f9aec36-111b-46c7-a593-491360935596'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='2e7bde22-32fc-4eb7-8ab2-0db7daab68a1'), SystemMessage(content='Results validation warning: Community-guided evaluation: 1 sequential + 5 parallel', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='083ee48c-aef3-49e6-94a3-cd6ea1f698d7'), SystemMessage(content='Refiner decision: retry - Generated 5 actionable hints for 6 tool calls (retry #1)', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5907b507-5ea6-455f-8003-e5b2869c9422'), SystemMessage(content='Query normalized: When a calixarene containing pyrrole groups binds an anion, what specific non-covalent interactions are typically involved?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='1980646e-290b-446c-ae46-cc01bd324631'), SystemMessage(content='Entity refinement not needed', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='31054376-0293-4b11-89d2-a46d5aba02b5'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='a48305d4-3f3e-460d-849d-641df95556c1'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='6c0934fb-a085-4140-a8a3-55c35dcc7c04'), SystemMessage(content='Results validation warning: Community-guided evaluation: 1 sequential + 2 parallel', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='88f4c247-047f-4f83-8de6-6b5f8708c3f5'), SystemMessage(content='Refiner decision: retry - Generated 3 actionable hints for 3 tool calls (retry #2)', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='416f82ca-671c-425e-867d-e4aaa1100b78'), SystemMessage(content='Query normalized: When a calixarene containing pyrrole groups binds an anion, what specific non-covalent interactions are typically involved?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='7587d55f-b65b-4949-8f72-a13cc3bb2642'), SystemMessage(content='Entity refinement not needed', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='22250837-2611-410c-b3fb-60b6340a8b00'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='66f8e8d1-f95e-4160-b3e2-7639f6948883'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='b4bf932d-66d2-472b-93e3-45cc1cc0f8c6'), SystemMessage(content='Results validation warning: Community-guided evaluation: 1 sequential + 2 parallel', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='c86dedd6-1689-4336-9e94-9b1a20436834'), SystemMessage(content='Refiner decision: retry - Generated 2 actionable hints for 3 tool calls (retry #3)', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='51f89ea5-692c-49da-9f88-f56f5df01e60'), SystemMessage(content='Query normalized: When a calixarene containing pyrrole groups binds an anion, what specific non-covalent interactions are typically involved?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='3f4bf238-60df-4be5-9ea8-dc8ec40f0726'), SystemMessage(content='Entity refinement not needed', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='549ce12d-ce79-4201-ab92-b3712ea7252c'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='ff30866a-c803-4adb-ba1a-d33aeef87770'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='547ce28c-9f16-4b88-87a5-13a303045b8e')]}]
