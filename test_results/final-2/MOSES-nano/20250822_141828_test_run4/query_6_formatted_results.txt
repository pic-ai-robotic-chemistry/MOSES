{'summary': 'Host molecules used in host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays primarily include beta-cyclodextrin, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, and macrocyclic hosts, which form complexes with specific guest molecules such as methylene blue.', 'key_points': ['Beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is used as a host molecule in electrochemical assays, forming host-guest complexes with guest molecules like methylene blue (MB).', 'Cucurbiturils, including cucurbit(7)uril (CB(7)) and cucurbit(8)uril (CB(8)), are macrocyclic hosts capable of forming high-affinity host-guest complexes, especially with methylated lysines and electron-deficient guests, and are used in molecular recognition and chemosensing.', 'Calixarenes are macrocyclic compounds with a hydrophobic cavity, used as receptors for amino acids, peptides, and organic molecules, and are applicable in sensor applications, drug delivery, and molecular recognition.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as pillararenes, cyclodextrins, and cucurbiturils are characterized by large ring structures with specific cavity sizes (e.g., large cavity, 9.1 Å height, hydrophobic interior) suitable for encapsulating various guest molecules, including dyes, drugs, and biomolecules.', 'These host molecules are integral to supramolecular chemistry, enabling selective recognition, complex formation, and applications in drug detection, chemosensing, and molecular delivery.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays involves macrocyclic molecules such as cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, and pillararenes, which form non-covalent complexes with specific guest molecules. These interactions are driven by hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and π-π stacking, depending on the host-guest pair.', 'Cucurbiturils are known for their high binding affinity (high affinity) and selectivity towards electron-deficient guests, including methylated lysines, and are used in chemosensing and molecular recognition. They have a hydrophobic interior and carbonyl portal ends that facilitate guest encapsulation.', 'Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides with a hydrophobic cavity that can include hydrophobic amino acids like phenylalanine, and are widely used in drug delivery and sensing due to their water solubility and ability to form inclusion complexes.', 'Calixarenes are cyclic phenolic compounds with a hydrophobic cavity, capable of binding a variety of molecules, including peptides and biomolecules, and are used as receptors in sensor applications and molecular recognition.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as pillararenes and cyclodextrins are characterized by their cavity size, shape, and functional groups, which determine their selectivity and binding strength for specific guest molecules, including dyes, drugs, and biomolecules.'], 'relationships': ['Cucurbiturils, calixarenes, cyclodextrins, and pillararenes are all macrocyclic hosts used for host-guest recognition.', 'Beta-cyclodextrin forms host-guest complexes with guest molecules like methylene blue, and is used in electrochemical assays.', 'Cucurbiturils, especially CB(7) and CB(8), are used for recognition of methylated lysines and electron-deficient guests, with high affinity and selectivity.', 'Calixarenes serve as structural scaffolds for recognition of methylated lysines and amino acids, with applications in chemosensing and drug delivery.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are characterized by cavity size, hydrophobicity, and functional groups, which influence their guest binding properties and applications in molecular recognition, sensing, and delivery.']}
