{'summary': 'Molecules that typically act as guests for supramolecular hosts include a wide variety of organic compounds, ions, and biomolecules such as cycloalkanes, cyclic ketones, long-chain alcohols, carboxylic acids, dyes, and amino acids, which interact via non-covalent forces within host cavities.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules encompass cycloalkanes (e.g., cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane), cyclic ketones, long-chain alcohols, and carboxylic acids, which are capable of fitting into host cavities based on size and shape complementarity.', 'Biomolecules such as amino acids (e.g., alanine, cysteine, tyrosine, lysine), peptides, and neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine) are recognized as guests, often engaging in hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic effects.', 'Organic dyes and aromatic compounds (e.g., anthracene, pyrene, fluorogenic dyes) are common guest molecules, frequently used in spectroscopic and fluorescence-based host-guest studies.', ' Ionic species such as anions (e.g., perchlorate, bromide, chloride, iodide) and cations (e.g., sodium ion, tetraalkylammonium salts) are also significant guests, with binding affinities influenced by electrostatic and polarizability interactions.', 'The size, shape, and functional groups of guest molecules, such as methyl, butyl, tert-butyl, and amino groups, critically determine their binding affinity and selectivity within host cavities.', 'Guest molecules can undergo exchange with other guests in dynamic systems, and their binding often involves enthalpic and entropic contributions, with specific thermodynamic parameters measured in studies.', 'The diversity of guest molecules reflects the broad applicability of supramolecular hosts in sensing, separation, drug delivery, and biomolecular recognition, with binding driven by non-covalent interactions including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic effects, and electrostatic forces.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts such as cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cavitands, resorcinarenes, macrocycles, and molecular tweezers are designed to recognize and bind specific guest molecules through size, shape, and functional group complementarity.', 'The binding process is often mediated by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic forces, and van der Waals forces, which are influenced by the properties of both host and guest.', 'Quantitative parameters such as association constants, binding stoichiometry (often 1:1), cavity volume (e.g., 200–300 Å^3), and thermodynamic data (enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy change) are critical for characterizing host-guest interactions.', 'The selectivity and affinity of hosts for particular guests are affected by factors such as cavity shape (bowl-shaped, toroidal), flexibility, and the presence of specific binding sites or pockets.', 'Biomolecular guests, including amino acids, peptides, and neurotransmitters, are of particular interest in biological and medicinal applications, where recognition often involves hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic effects.', 'Synthetic hosts like cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and calixarenes are extensively studied for their ability to encapsulate a wide range of guest molecules, facilitating applications in sensors, drug delivery, and molecular separations.', 'The thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of guest binding are studied using techniques such as NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and fluorescence spectroscopy, providing insights into the driving forces and mechanisms of complex formation.'], 'relationships': ['The structural features of guest molecules, such as size, shape, and functional groups, directly influence their compatibility with host cavities, affecting binding affinity and selectivity.', 'The interaction mechanisms involve a combination of hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic effects, and van der Waals forces, which are modulated by the properties of both host and guest.', 'The thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy) are interrelated, with enthalpy-driven binding often involving specific interactions like hydrogen bonds, while entropy contributions may arise from desolvation and conformational freedom.', 'Biomolecular guests such as amino acids and neurotransmitters often engage in multiple non-covalent interactions simultaneously, leading to complex recognition patterns.', 'The size of the cavity (200–300 Å^3) and shape (bowl, toroidal) are critical determinants for the accommodation of specific guest molecules, influencing the binding selectivity.']}
