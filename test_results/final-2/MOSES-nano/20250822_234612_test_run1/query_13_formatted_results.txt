{'summary': 'Molecules acting as guests for supramolecular hosts are primarily organic or inorganic species that can be encapsulated or interact via non-covalent interactions within host cavities such as macrocycles, cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and cucurbiturils.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules include organic species like aromatic, hydrophilic, hydrophobic, positively-charged, and functionalized compounds, as well as inorganic species such as anions and cations.', 'Quantitative affinity data for anions (e.g., 1.6–5.7 kcal mol^-1 for certain hosts) indicate the strength of host-guest interactions.', 'Structural features like cavity volume (e.g., 200–300 Å^3 for cucurbiturils) and shape (bowl, toroidal) are critical for guest accommodation.', 'Guest molecules often contain specific functional groups (aromatic moiety, imidazole, benzyl, methylation sites) that facilitate binding through hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions.', 'The binding affinity and selectivity are influenced by properties such as amphiphilicity, hydrophobicity, electrostatic potential, and the presence of specific recognition motifs (e.g., trimethyllysine, dimethylarginine).', 'Methodologies like NMR, ITC, and density functional theory (DFT) are used to characterize host-guest interactions and binding thermodynamics.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts such as calixarenes, cyclodextrins, crown ethers, and cucurbiturils are designed to recognize and bind specific guest molecules through non-covalent interactions, forming stable complexes.', 'Host-guest chemistry relies on cavity size, shape complementarity, and functional group interactions to achieve selectivity and high affinity.', 'Guest molecules can be neutral, charged, aromatic, or aliphatic, with their binding influenced by solvation effects, counterions, and environmental conditions.', 'Applications include drug delivery, molecular recognition, sensors, and biomolecular interactions, where the nature of the guest determines the functional outcome.', 'Quantitative affinity data, such as binding energies and association constants, are essential for designing selective host-guest systems.', 'The structural and thermodynamic properties of guest molecules, including cavity filling, desolvation energy, and hydrogen bonding capacity, are key determinants of binding behavior.'], 'relationships': ['Host molecules like calixarenes, cyclodextrins, crown ethers, and cucurbiturils serve as molecular baskets or containers that encapsulate guest molecules.', 'Guest molecules are characterized by their ability to fit into host cavities, with size and functional groups dictating binding strength and selectivity.', 'Binding interactions involve hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, electrostatic attractions, hydrophobic effects, and van der Waals forces.', 'Quantitative data such as cavity volume (e.g., 200–300 Å^3 for cucurbiturils) and binding energies (e.g., 1.6–5.7 kcal mol^-1 for anions) reveal the nature of host-guest affinity.', 'Structural features like aromatic moieties, functional groups (imidazole, benzyl, methylation sites), and amphiphilicity influence the binding mechanism.', 'Methodologies like NMR, ITC, and DFT calculations are employed to analyze thermodynamics, binding modes, and structural compatibility.']}
