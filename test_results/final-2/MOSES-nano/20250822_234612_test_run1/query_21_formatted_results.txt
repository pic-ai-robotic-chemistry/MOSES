{'summary': 'IDA (Information-Dependent Acquisition) can detect a broad spectrum of molecules including metal ions, small organic molecules, and various biomolecules such as carbohydrates, metabolites, nucleic acids, and proteins.', 'key_points': ['Metal ions detected by IDA have a coordination sphere, specifically the first coordination sphere, and are often competed by solvents.', 'Small organic molecules are detectable, though specific subclasses or properties are not detailed.', 'Biomolecules detectable by IDA include carbohydrates, metabolites, nucleic acids, and proteins, with properties such as hydrophobicity being relevant.', 'In the hierarchical classification, metal ions are considered substrates, and biomolecules are categorized as analytes or molecules, indicating their role in detection processes.'], 'background_information': ['IDAs are analytical techniques used in mass spectrometry, particularly in LC-MS/MS workflows, to identify and quantify molecules based on their mass-to-charge ratios and fragmentation patterns.', 'The detection of metal ions involves their coordination chemistry, where the first coordination sphere (the immediate ligands) plays a critical role in their identification.', 'Biomolecules such as carbohydrates, metabolites, nucleic acids, and proteins are common targets in biological mass spectrometry, with their detection often relying on specific ionization and fragmentation behaviors.', 'Small organic molecules, which include a wide range of chemical entities, are also detectable, though the specific subclasses or properties are not explicitly detailed in the results.'], 'relationships': ['Metal ions are characterized by their coordination sphere, which influences their detectability and interaction with solvents.', 'Biomolecules are classified into specific types (carbohydrate, metabolite, nucleic acid, protein), indicating the diversity of detectable biomolecular classes.', 'The hierarchical classification shows that metal ions are considered substrates, implying their role as analytes or targets in detection, while biomolecules are categorized as analytes or molecules, emphasizing their role as detectable entities in the analytical process.']}
