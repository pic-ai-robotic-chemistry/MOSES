{'summary': 'Cage molecules are primarily used for encapsulation, guest exchange, and structural stabilization, often in catalysis and molecular recognition, while macrocycles are extensively employed in biomolecule recognition, host-guest chemistry, and sensing applications; overlaps occur in biomolecular recognition and sensing.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules such as Fe8L6 cubic coordination cages, FeZnP, and Fujita Pd6L4 coordination cages are mainly utilized for encapsulation, guest accommodation (e.g., indole rings, ala methyl groups), and inducing aggregation or disaggregation, with applications in catalysis and molecular recognition.', 'Macrocycles like cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararenes, and others are used for host-guest complexation, biomolecule recognition, fluorescence-based sensing, and as platforms for multivalent systems, with some macrocycles (e.g., cucurbiturils, pillararenes) capable of forming inclusion complexes similar to cages.', 'Both classes can form inclusion complexes and are used in sensing and biomolecule recognition, indicating overlapping applications in supramolecular chemistry.', 'Quantitative data such as cavity size (large for cages, small rim for macrocycles), binding affinities (nanomolar for cages, micromolar for macrocycles), and yields (64%) highlight their functional differences and similarities.'], 'background_information': ['Cage molecules are often characterized by their three-dimensional, polyhedral structures capable of encapsulating guest molecules within their cavities, which can be tailored for specific guest sizes and functionalities. They are used in catalysis, molecular encapsulation, and as nanoreactors.', 'Macrocycles are cyclic molecules with a defined cavity, often stabilized by hydrogen bonds, π-π interactions, or other non-covalent forces, making them suitable for host-guest chemistry, biomolecular recognition, and sensing.', 'The structural features such as cavity size, hydrophobicity, and functionalization influence their application scope. For example, large cavities in cages facilitate the encapsulation of bigger guests, while macrocycles with smaller rims are suited for selective binding of specific biomolecules.', 'Both classes are integral to supramolecular chemistry, with applications extending to drug delivery, molecular sensors, and artificial light-harvesting systems.', 'The detailed properties, such as the ability to induce aggregation, form inclusion complexes, and their interaction with biomolecules, demonstrate their versatility and overlapping functionalities.'], 'relationships': ['Cage molecules can accommodate specific groups like indole rings and ala methyl groups, indicating their role in selective guest encapsulation.', 'Macrocycles can form inclusion complexes and have hydrogen bonding capabilities, which are essential for biomolecular recognition and sensing.', 'Both classes can be integrated into nanostructures and sensing scaffolds, showing their overlapping utility in nanotechnology and analytical chemistry.', 'The structural and functional similarities, such as aromatic components and the ability to bind peptides or biomolecules, suggest potential for cross-application in sensing and recognition platforms.']}
