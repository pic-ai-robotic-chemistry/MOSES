{'summary': 'Several supramolecular hosts, notably calixarenes and cucurbiturils, are known to bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions, with detailed structural and property data supporting their high affinity and selectivity for cationic and aromatic guests.', 'key_points': ['Calix(6)arene and calix(8)arene form host-guest complexes with a single cavity and have conformations such as flattened cone or c3 conformations, facilitating cation-π interactions.', 'Cucurbit(7)uril and cucurbit(8)uril exhibit high affinity binding (nanomolar range) for amino acids, peptides, and methylated lysine residues, relying on contact with positively charged groups like N-terminal NH3+ and methylated amines, indicative of cation-π interactions.', 'Cucurbiturils have an internal diameter of approximately 8.8 Å, suitable for accommodating aromatic and cationic guests, and are characterized by X-ray crystal structures confirming their recognition capabilities.', 'Gamma-cyclodextrin and beta-cyclodextrin are involved in recognition of chaotropic and inorganic anions, water structure recovery, and complexation with inorganic anions, but are less directly associated with cation-π interactions.', 'Structural data such as high-energy water release, recognition of methylated lysine, and specific diameters support the role of these hosts in cation-π binding mechanisms.'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are non-covalent binding forces where a cation interacts favorably with the electron-rich π-system of aromatic rings. They are crucial in biological recognition, drug design, and supramolecular chemistry.', 'Calixarenes, especially calix(6) and calix(8), are macrocyclic compounds with phenolic units that can adopt conformations conducive to cation-π interactions, often used in sensing and molecular recognition.', 'Cucurbiturils are pumpkin-shaped macrocycles with a hydrophobic cavity and carbonyl-lined portals, known for their high binding affinities and selectivity for cationic and aromatic guests, often stabilized by cation-π interactions.', 'Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides primarily involved in hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, with some capacity for ion recognition, but less prominent in cation-π binding compared to cucurbiturils and calixarenes.', 'The detailed structural and thermodynamic data, including diameters, recognition targets, and binding constants, underscore the importance of geometric and electronic complementarity in cation-π host-guest chemistry.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes and cucurbiturils are structurally designed to facilitate cation-π interactions through their cavity size, conformations, and electronic properties.', "Cucurbiturils' recognition of methylated lysine and amino acids, along with their high affinity and specific diameters, highlight their role in cation-π binding.", 'The structural data such as X-ray crystal structures and water release energetics support the mechanistic understanding of cation-π stabilization in these hosts.', 'Cyclodextrins, while structurally different, participate in recognition processes that may involve other non-covalent interactions, but are less characterized for cation-π interactions.']}
