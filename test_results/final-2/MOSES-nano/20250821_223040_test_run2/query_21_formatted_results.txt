{'summary': 'IDA (Information-Dependent Acquisition) can detect a broad spectrum of molecules including metal ions, small organic molecules, and various biomolecules such as carbohydrates, metabolites, nucleic acids, and proteins.', 'key_points': ['Metal ions are detectable by IDA, with their coordination spheres often involving a first coordination sphere, and their detection can be influenced by the presence of competing solvents.', 'Small organic molecules are within the detection scope of IDA, although specific structural or property details are not provided.', 'Biomolecules detectable by IDA include carbohydrates, metabolites, nucleic acids, and proteins, with their detection potentially influenced by properties such as hydrophobicity.'], 'background_information': ['IDA is a versatile detection method used in mass spectrometry, particularly in proteomics and metabolomics, capable of identifying a wide range of molecular classes.', 'The detection of metal ions involves their coordination chemistry, where the first coordination sphere plays a critical role in their stability and detectability.', 'Biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids are often detected via their characteristic mass-to-charge ratios, with their structural features influencing ionization efficiency.', 'Small organic molecules are typically detected based on their molecular weight and chemical properties, which can vary widely across different classes.'], 'relationships': ['Metal ions are often detected in the context of their coordination chemistry, with the first coordination sphere being a key structural feature.', 'Biomolecules are classified into specific types (carbohydrates, metabolites, nucleic acids, proteins), indicating that IDA can target diverse structural and functional classes.', 'The presence of competing solvents can influence metal ion detection, suggesting that sample preparation and solvent choice are critical for accurate analysis.']}
