{'summary': 'Cage molecules and macrocycles are both supramolecular hosts with overlapping applications, particularly in molecular recognition, sensing, and drug delivery, but they differ in structural features and specific functional uses.', 'key_points': ['Macrocycles are characterized by their ability to form inclusion complexes with guest molecules, releasing water upon binding and controlling guest exchange processes, with notable examples like cucurbiturils, pillararenes, and cyclodextrins.', 'Cage molecules are defined by their capacity to accommodate specific structural restrictions such as indole rings or methyl groups, indicating a focus on selective encapsulation, often in a three-dimensional, polyhedral framework.', 'Both classes are involved in biomolecular recognition, sensing, and the development of functional materials, with macrocycles often used in supramolecular chemistry and host-guest chemistry, while cages are tailored for selective encapsulation of particular molecular entities.'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles are cyclic compounds with a large ring structure, often used as hosts in supramolecular chemistry due to their ability to form stable inclusion complexes with various guest molecules. They are integral to applications such as molecular sensors, drug delivery systems, and artificial light-harvesting systems.', 'Cage molecules are three-dimensional, polyhedral structures capable of encapsulating specific molecules or ions, with applications in targeted drug delivery, molecular separation, and catalysis. Their structural restrictions, such as accommodating indole rings or methyl groups, enable selective binding.', 'Both macrocycles and cages are part of the broader field of supramolecular chemistry, which explores non-covalent interactions for constructing complex molecular architectures. Their overlapping uses include biomolecular recognition, sensing, and the development of functional materials, but cages tend to focus more on encapsulation of larger or more complex entities, whereas macrocycles excel in reversible guest binding and molecular recognition.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles and cages both serve as supramolecular hosts but differ in structural complexity and application focus.', 'Macrocycles are often used in systems requiring reversible guest exchange, such as sensors and drug delivery, while cages are more suited for encapsulating specific molecules or ions in a protected environment.', 'Both classes can be integrated into nanostructures and sensing scaffolds, indicating their overlapping roles in advanced material design and molecular recognition technologies.', 'The structural features, such as the hydrophobic cavity in macrocycles and the ability of cages to accommodate specific restrictions like indole rings, underpin their functional versatility and application overlap.']}
