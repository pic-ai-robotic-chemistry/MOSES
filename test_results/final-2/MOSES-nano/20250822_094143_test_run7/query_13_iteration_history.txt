[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': "The query is asking about the types of molecules that typically serve as 'guests' in supramolecular chemistry, meaning molecules that are non-covalently bound or encapsulated by larger 'host' molecules. The question seeks to identify common classes or specific molecules that function as guests, such as ions, small organic molecules, or biomolecules. The use of the term 'types' suggests a focus on categories or classes of guest molecules rather than individual compounds. The tool analysis likely identified classes such as 'guest molecules,' 'supramolecular hosts,' and related categories, with some classes containing detailed information about molecular interactions, sizes, and properties relevant to host-guest chemistry.", 'hypothetical_answer': "In supramolecular chemistry, typical guest molecules include a variety of classes such as cations (e.g., alkali and alkaline earth metal ions), anions (e.g., chloride, sulfate), small organic molecules (e.g., aromatic compounds like benzene, naphthalene), neutral molecules (e.g., gases like methane, small alcohols), and biomolecules (e.g., amino acids, peptides, nucleotides). These guests are characterized by their ability to form non-covalent interactions—such as hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, van der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions—with host molecules. Common hosts include cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and crown ethers, which are designed to selectively encapsulate or bind these guest molecules based on size, shape, and chemical functionality. The richness of classes like 'guest molecules' and 'supramolecular hosts' in the ontology indicates that guest molecules are often small, structurally diverse, and capable of specific non-covalent interactions, making them suitable for applications in sensing, drug delivery, and molecular recognition.", 'key_concepts': ['Host-guest chemistry', 'Non-covalent interactions', 'Cation and anion
