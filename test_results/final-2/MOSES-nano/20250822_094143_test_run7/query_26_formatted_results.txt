{'summary': 'Supramolecular hosts known to bind primarily through cation-π interactions include cucurbiturils (notably CB7 and CB8), calixarenes (such as calix(4), calix(6), and calix(8)), and cyclodextrins, which exhibit specific structural features conducive to cation-π binding.', 'key_points': ['Cucurbiturils, especially cucurbit(7)uril and cucurbit(8)uril, are prominent macrocyclic hosts with high affinity for amino acids and peptides, often involving cation-π interactions, as evidenced by their recognition of methylated lysines and amino acids.', 'Calixarenes, including calix(4), calix(6), and calix(8), are cyclic phenolic compounds with conformational flexibility and functionalizable rims, capable of engaging in cation-π interactions, especially when modified or in specific conformations.', 'Cyclodextrins, particularly beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, are cyclic oligosaccharides with hydrophobic cavities that can facilitate cation-π interactions, notably with hydrophobic amino acids and aromatic guests.', 'The structural features such as cavity size, rim functionalization, and the presence of aromatic or heteroatom-rich groups are critical determinants for cation-π binding efficacy in these hosts.'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are non-covalent binding forces where a cation interacts with the electron-rich π-system of aromatic rings. These interactions are fundamental in biological recognition processes, such as neurotransmitter binding and enzyme catalysis, and are exploited in supramolecular chemistry for selective guest binding.', 'Cucurbiturils are known for their rigid, pumpkin-shaped cavities with portals that can stabilize cationic guests through cation-π and ion-dipole interactions, making them highly effective in binding amino acids and peptides with positively charged side chains.', 'Calixarenes are versatile macrocycles that can be functionalized at their rims to enhance cation-π interactions, especially when aromatic or heteroaromatic groups are introduced, enabling selective recognition of cationic species.', 'Cyclodextrins, although primarily recognized for hydrophobic inclusion, can also participate in cation-π interactions when their cavities contain or are modified with aromatic groups, facilitating binding of cationic or aromatic guests.', 'The structural parameters such as cavity size (e.g., calix(4), calix(6), calix(8)), portal diameter (e.g., cucurbiturils with diameters around 6.9 Å for CB7 and 8.8 Å for CB8), and rim functionalization are critical for optimizing cation-π interactions.'], 'relationships': ['Cucurbiturils (CB7 and CB8) are extensively studied for their high affinity and selectivity in amino acid recognition, often involving cation-π interactions, especially with methylated lysines.', 'Calixarenes, particularly calix(4), calix(6), and calix(8), are structurally flexible macrocycles that can be tailored for cation-π binding through rim modifications and conformational control.', 'Cyclodextrins, especially beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, can be engineered to enhance cation-π interactions, broadening their application in host-guest chemistry involving aromatic and cationic species.', 'The structural features such as cavity size and rim functionalization directly influence the strength and selectivity of cation-π interactions across these host classes.']}
