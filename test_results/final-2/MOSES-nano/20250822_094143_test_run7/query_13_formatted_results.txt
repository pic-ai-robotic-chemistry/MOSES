{'summary': 'Molecules that typically act as guests for supramolecular hosts are diverse, including organic compounds, ions, biomolecules, and hydrophobic entities, with specific affinity influenced by size, shape, charge, and functional groups.', 'key_points': ['Guests are molecules or ions capable of binding within host cavities via non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic effects, electrostatic forces, and van der Waals interactions.', 'Common guest molecules include organic compounds such as aromatic hydrocarbons, alkyl chains, amino acids, peptides, ions (e.g., anions like Cl-, SO4^2-, cations like Na+, K+), biomolecules (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids), and hydrophobic entities like cycloalkanes and long-chain alcohols.', 'Quantitative data indicates that binding affinities vary widely, with some hosts showing selectivity based on size, shape, and electronic properties, such as Hofmeister series following affinity trends.', 'Structural features such as cavity size (200–300 Å^3), shape complementarity (bowl, toroidal, vase conformations), and the presence of specific functional groups (methyl, tert-butyl, amino, carboxylate) are critical for guest recognition and binding strength.'], 'background_information': ['The diversity of guest molecules reflects the broad applicability of supramolecular chemistry in areas like drug delivery, sensors, and molecular recognition. The structural data indicates that guest molecules are often tailored to fit the host cavity, emphasizing size and shape complementarity, as well as specific interactions like hydrogen bonding and electrostatics.', 'Methodologies such as NMR, ITC, and X-ray crystallography are used to characterize host-guest complexes, providing thermodynamic and structural insights. Quantitative affinity data (e.g., 1.6–5.7 kcal mol^-1 for anion affinity) highlights the importance of electrostatic and hydrophobic effects.', 'The structural hierarchy of guests includes small organic molecules, biomolecules, ions, and hydrophobic entities, with properties like flexibility, conformational diversity, and solvation state influencing binding behavior.', 'Hosts such as cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, cavitands, and macrocycles are designed with specific cavity geometries and functional groups to target particular guest classes, often following the Hofmeister series for ion affinity.'], 'relationships': ['The structural features of hosts (e.g., cavity size, shape, and functional groups) directly influence the class of molecules that can act as guests.', 'Guest molecules often possess complementary size, shape, and surface chemistry to fit within the host cavity, with hydrophobic, aromatic, and charged groups being common recognition motifs.', 'The affinity and selectivity of guest binding are modulated by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic effects, and solvation/desolvation processes.', 'Biomolecules such as amino acids and peptides are recognized by macrocyclic hosts with specific functional groups, enabling applications in biological sensing and drug delivery.', 'The Hofmeister series guides the affinity trends for ions, with specific cations and anions showing preferential binding based on their charge density and hydration energy.']}
