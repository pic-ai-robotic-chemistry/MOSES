{'summary': 'Currently, there are no documented electrochemical sensors employing Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) specifically for Quinine detection.', 'key_points': ['Quinine is detected by methods including electrochemiluminescence biosensors, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), and quantitative electrochemical methods.', 'Quinine is analyzed by electrochemical techniques such as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), which is relevant for electrochemical sensing.', 'No existing data confirms the use of IDA-based electrochemical sensors for Quinine detection.', "Quinine's detection involves various electrochemical and spectroscopic methods, but IDA-based sensors are not explicitly reported."], 'background_information': ['Quinine, an alkaloid component of cinchona tree bark, is involved in multiple detection methods including colorimetric assays, fluorescence assays, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).', 'Electrochemical detection of Quinine typically involves techniques such as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), and electrochemiluminescence biosensors.', 'Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a recognition strategy used in molecular sensing, with applications in intracellular sensing and molecular recognition, but specific use in electrochemical sensors for Quinine has not been documented.'], 'relationships': ['While Quinine can be detected by electrochemical methods, the specific application of IDA in electrochemical sensors for Quinine detection remains unreported.', "The absence of 'electrochemical_sensors' class in the data indicates a lack of documented electrochemical sensors explicitly using IDA for Quinine detection, despite the presence of other electrochemical detection methods."]}
