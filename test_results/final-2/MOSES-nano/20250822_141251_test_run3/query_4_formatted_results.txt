{'summary': 'An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) comprises a host molecule, an indicator dye, and a recognition element, with the assay detecting specific analytes through displacement of the dye, resulting in a measurable signal.', 'key_points': ['The assay uses as recognition element a deep_cavitand (classes.deep_cavitand) and detects analytes such as trimethylated_lysine (classes.trimethylated_lysine).', "The assay's selectivity can be targeted towards specific analytes like caffeine.", 'Components include host molecules such as carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene(WP6) and safranine_T(ST).', 'Indicator dyes used in IDAs include lucigenin and dye_28, which produce measurable signals upon displacement.', 'The assay is applied in lipid membrane constructs and living cells, primarily for caffeine sensing.'], 'background_information': ['An indicator displacement assay (IDA) is a sensing method where a host molecule binds to an indicator dye, and the presence of an analyte displaces the dye, producing a measurable signal. This technique is widely used for detecting post-translational modifications in proteins, such as trimethylated_lysine, and for ultrasensitive detection of molecules like LPA through differential sensing.', 'IDAs often employ specific recognition elements such as deep_cavitands, which provide selective binding sites for target analytes. The components of the assay include host molecules (e.g., carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene(WP6), safranine_T(ST)) and indicator dyes (e.g., lucigenin, dye_28).', "The detection process involves the displacement of the indicator dye from the host by the analyte, with the assay's selectivity and sensitivity influenced by the host's binding affinity and the dye's optical properties.", 'Applications extend to sensing in complex biological environments, including lipid membranes and living cells, with specificity towards analytes like caffeine and trimethylated_lysine.'], 'relationships': ['The recognition element (deep_cavitand) interacts with specific analytes (e.g., trimethylated_lysine) and is part of the host component in the assay.', 'The indicator dyes (lucigenin, dye_28) are displaced by analytes, leading to a measurable signal change.', 'The assay components (host molecules and indicator dyes) are selected based on the target analyte and the desired detection environment (e.g., lipid membranes, living cells).', "The assay's selectivity towards caffeine is achieved through specific host-guest interactions involving the recognition element and the analyte."]}
