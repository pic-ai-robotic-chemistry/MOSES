{'summary': 'IDA (Indicator Displacement Assay) can detect a variety of molecules including biomolecules, small organic molecules, and specific analytes like trimethylated lysine, through mechanisms involving host-guest interactions, dye displacement, and coordination chemistry.', 'key_points': ['IDAs utilize host molecules such as deep_cavitand and indicator dyes like safranine_T(ST) or lucigenin to detect target analytes.', 'IDAs can detect biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and metabolites, often by recognizing post-translational modifications or specific molecular features.', 'Small organic molecules, including peptides and proteins, are recognized by cavitand receptors, which have applications in molecular recognition.', 'Metal ions serve as targets in IDAs, with detection mechanisms based on their coordination sphere, Lewis acidity, and ability to form complexes with macrocyclic hosts.', 'Detection of specific analytes like trimethylated_lysine is achieved through displacement of indicators, enabling ultrasensitive and specific sensing.', 'IDAs are applicable in lipid membrane constructs and living cells, with detection sensitivity influenced by host-guest chemistry and competitive interactions with solvents.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays are a class of pattern-based sensing methods where a dye is displaced from a host molecule by an analyte, resulting in a measurable signal change. They are used for detecting post-translational modifications in proteins, such as trimethylated lysine, and for sensing biomolecules in complex biological environments.', 'Metal ions are key targets in IDAs due to their coordination chemistry, Lewis acidity, and ability to form complexes with macrocyclic hosts like calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and crown ethers. These interactions are influenced by the first coordination sphere and are often modulated by solvent competition.', 'Biomolecules recognized in IDAs include proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and metabolites. These molecules often interact via hydrophobicity and specific binding sites, with detection challenges related to water solubility and specificity.', 'Small organic molecules, including peptides and proteins, are recognized by cavitand receptors, which have been applied in molecular recognition and sensing applications.', 'The detection mechanisms involve host-guest interactions, dye displacement, and coordination chemistry, with quantitative parameters such as binding constants (moderate in competitive water medium) and concentration excess (e.g., 100-fold excess for metal ion binding).'], 'relationships': ['IDAs utilize host molecules like deep_cavitand and indicator dyes to detect specific analytes such as trimethylated_lysine.', 'Biomolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, metabolites) are recognized by macrocycles in biomolecule recognition applications, often involving hydrophobic interactions.', 'Metal ions are targeted through coordination spheres, with binding strength influenced by the first coordination sphere and competition from solvents.', 'Detection of specific molecules like trimethylated lysine is achieved via displacement of indicator dyes, enabling ultrasensitive sensing.', 'Small organic molecules, including peptides and proteins, are recognized by cavitand receptors, which are used in recognition applications.']}
