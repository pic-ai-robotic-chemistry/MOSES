{'summary': 'Supramolecular hosts known to bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions are not explicitly identified in the provided data. However, certain classes of supramolecular hosts, such as macrocycles, calixarenes, porphyrins, and cyclophanes, are associated with anion binding, often involving π-conjugated systems that can facilitate anion-π interactions.', 'key_points': ['The data indicates that supramolecular hosts can target classes such as posttranslational methylation, amino acids, peptides, and proteins, with binding affinities to methylated targets like trimethyllysine, often in biologically relevant solvents (warm, salty water).', 'These hosts are designed for high selectivity and strong binding affinity (sufficient to out-compete native reader proteins), with methylation state discrimination being a key feature.', 'The structural basis for anion-π interactions involves π-conjugated systems, which are characteristic of macrocycles, calixarenes, porphyrins, and cyclophanes, although explicit examples are not detailed in the results.', 'The data emphasizes the role of π-systems in host-guest chemistry, enabling interactions such as anion-π, which are relevant in biological contexts and chemical biology applications.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are non-covalent interactions where anions are stabilized by π-electron-deficient aromatic systems. These interactions are often exploited in supramolecular chemistry to design hosts that can selectively bind anions.', 'Common supramolecular hosts capable of engaging in anion-π interactions include macrocyclic compounds with π-conjugated frameworks, such as porphyrins, cyclophanes, and calixarene derivatives, which can be engineered to present electron-deficient π-surfaces.', 'The structural features facilitating anion-π interactions typically involve electron-deficient aromatic rings, often substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, creating a positive electrostatic potential above the π-plane.', 'The relevance of these interactions extends to biological systems, where they can contribute to the recognition and binding of anionic biomolecules, and are studied for applications in sensors, separation, and catalysis.', 'Despite the absence of explicit examples in the results, the structural motifs associated with π-conjugated systems are well-documented in literature as key components in anion-π host design.'], 'relationships': ['The data suggests a relationship between the presence of π-conjugated systems in supramolecular hosts and their ability to engage in anion-π interactions.', 'Hosts designed for methylated amino acids, such as trimethyllysine, often utilize π-systems to achieve high binding affinity and selectivity, implying a possible role for anion-π interactions in these systems.', 'The structural features of macrocycles, calixarenes, porphyrins, and cyclophanes, which are known to contain π-conjugated frameworks, are likely candidates for facilitating anion-π interactions, although explicit examples are not provided.', 'The biological relevance of these hosts, including their ability to discriminate methylation states and bind in physiologically relevant solvents, underscores the importance of π-systems in mediating non-covalent interactions such as anion-π.']}
