{'summary': 'Supramolecular hosts known to bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions include macrocycles with aromatic surfaces, macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes, porphyrins, and related macrocyclic systems like metal porphyrins, porphyrin rings, Zn-porphyrin capsules, and porphyrin tweezer systems.', 'key_points': ['Macrocycles with aromatic surface features, such as aromatic macrocycles, are potential candidates for anion-π interactions due to their exposed aromatic surface and ability to form inclusion complexes.', 'Macrocyclic hosts like cucurbiturils, pillararenes, and β-cyclodextrins are similar in structure and function, often involved in biomolecule recognition and guest exchange processes, but their primary binding mechanisms are not specified as anion-π interactions.', 'Aromatic macrocycles, including calixarenes, porphyrins, and phthalocyanines, are known to participate in non-covalent interactions involving π-systems, which can facilitate anion-π interactions, especially when the macrocycle has an exposed aromatic ring or aromatic surface.', 'Specific macrocyclic host molecules such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines, and calixarenes are structurally capable of engaging in anion-π interactions owing to their conjugated π-systems and aromatic rings.', 'Metal porphyrins, porphyrin rings, Zn-porphyrin capsules, and porphyrin tweezer systems are explicitly identified as macrocyclic host molecules with potential for anion-π interactions, especially considering their aromatic and conjugated structures.', 'The interaction type for macrocycles includes hydrophobic (within the cavity) and polar (at the carbonyl rims), with some macrocycles having intrinsic fluorescence and the ability to form inclusion complexes, which may influence their binding modes.', 'Macrocycles such as cucurbiturils, pillararenes, and β-cyclodextrins are similar to macrocycles in their recognition capabilities but are not explicitly characterized as engaging in anion-π interactions in the provided data.'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles with aromatic surfaces, such as aromatic macrocycles, calixarenes, and porphyrins, are known to participate in non-covalent π-interactions, including π-π stacking and anion-π interactions, especially when their aromatic rings are exposed and accessible.', 'Anion-π interactions involve the attraction between anionic species and electron-deficient π-systems, often facilitated by electron-withdrawing substituents on aromatic rings, which can be present in macrocyclic hosts like porphyrins and calixarenes.', 'Porphyrin-based macrocyclic hosts, including metal porphyrins, are characterized by conjugated aromatic systems capable of engaging in π-interactions with anions, especially in aqueous or organic solvents.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils, pillararenes, and β-cyclodextrins are structurally similar to macrocycles but are primarily known for hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions rather than explicit anion-π interactions.', 'The presence of exposed aromatic surfaces and conjugated π-systems in macrocyclic hosts enhances their potential to participate in anion-π interactions, which are increasingly recognized as a significant non-covalent binding mode in supramolecular chemistry.', 'The structural features such as cavity size (large), cavity hydrophobicity (more hydrophobic), and the ability to form inclusion complexes are relevant for the binding affinity and selectivity of macrocyclic hosts for anions via anion-π interactions.', 'The specific macrocyclic molecules like porphyrins and their derivatives are often used in sensing, molecular recognition, and catalysis, where π-interactions, including anion-π, play a crucial role.'], 'relationships': ['Aromatic macrocycles, including calixarenes, porphyrins, and phthalocyanines, are structurally capable of engaging in anion-π interactions due to their conjugated π-systems

when functionalized with electron-withdrawing groups.']}
