{'summary': 'Yes, there are known supramolecular hosts that are derivatives of calixarenes and feature pyrrole functional groups, notably calix(4)pyrrole derivatives, which are structurally based on calixarene frameworks and incorporate pyrrole units.', 'key_points': ["Calixarene derivatives are synthesized via condensation reactions of formaldehyde with p-alkylphenols under basic conditions, with derivatization capabilities described as 'almost unlimited' (source: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).", 'Calix(4)pyrrole is a macrocycle with four pyrrole units, fixed in cone conformation, capable of forming hydrophobic pockets, and can bind anions, especially through its pyrrole units (source: 10.1021/acs.joc.1c00794; 10.1039/c6cc04771h).', 'Calix(4)pyrrole can be modified to water-soluble synthetic receptors and is formed by condensation reactions involving pyrrole or ketone groups, with a structural unit comprising pyrrole and meso_carbon_bridge.', 'Calix(4)pyrrole derivatives are structurally related to calixarenes, sharing features such as the ability to form hydrophobic pockets, bind anions, and be modified for water solubility, making them relevant as supramolecular hosts.'], 'background_information': ['Calixarenes are macrocyclic compounds synthesized through formaldehyde and p-alkylphenol reactions, with extensive derivatization potential and applications in adsorption, sensing, drug detection, and nanocapsulation (sources: 10.1021/jo502825z; 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Calix(4)pyrrole is a specific macrocyclic structure with four pyrrole units, fixed in cone conformation, capable of forming hydrophobic pockets and binding anions, often formed via condensation reactions involving pyrrole or ketone groups (sources: 10.1021/acs.joc.1c00794; 10.1039/c6cc04771h).', 'Both calixarenes and calix(4)pyrroles are studied within supramolecular chemistry for their host-guest interactions, recognition capabilities, and potential for functional modifications, including derivatization to water-soluble forms and incorporation of various functional groups.'], 'relationships': ['Calix(4)pyrrole is a derivative structurally related to calixarenes, sharing the macrocyclic framework but distinguished by pyrrole units.', 'Calixarene derivatives, including calix(4)pyrrole, are synthesized via condensation reactions and can be modified extensively, including functional group modifications and rim modifications.', "Calix(4)pyrrole's ability to form hydrophobic pockets and bind anions links it functionally to calixarene-based hosts, which are also known for their host-guest chemistry, sensing, and biomedical applications."]}
