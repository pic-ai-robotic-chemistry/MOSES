{'summary': 'Cage molecules are primarily used for guest accommodation, including selective binding and encapsulation of specific groups like indole rings and ala-methyl groups, while macrocycles are extensively employed in biomolecular recognition, host-guest chemistry, and sensing applications, with diverse structural features such as apolar surfaces, hydrogen bonding, and fluorescence.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules can accommodate indole_ring OR ala_methyl_group, with cavity sizes described as large and small rim, and can form inclusion complexes with guest molecules, exhibiting hydrogen bond formation and hydrophobic interactions within confined cavities.', 'Macrocycles possess properties such as apolar surface, solubilising groups, hydrogen bonding units, pi-pi stacking interactions (e.g., bipyridinium_salt_g14), and intrinsic fluorescence, enabling their application in biomolecule recognition, water release upon binding, and as supramolecular hosts.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles are used in molecular recognition, but macrocycles have broader applications including biomolecule recognition, sensing, and as components of artificial light harvesting systems, with macrocycle effects on aggregation being minor (e.g., SCX4 vs SCX6).', 'Cage molecules are characterized by limited conformational flexibility, high preorganization, and potential for functionalization at specific sites, making them suitable for selective guest binding and complex formation.', 'Macrocycles are often synthesized via high-temperature condensation of glycouril under acidic conditions, and their structural features include aromatic rings, exposed aromatic surfaces, and the ability to form inclusion complexes, with applications in sensing scaffolds, nanostructures, and solutions.'], 'background_information': ['Cage molecules are a class of supramolecular hosts capable of accommodating specific guest groups such as indole rings and ala-methyl groups, with cavity sizes described as large and small rim, and are often used for inclusion complex formation, guest encapsulation, and in host-guest chemistry.', 'Macrocycles are cyclic small molecules with diverse structural features, including apolar surfaces, solubilising groups, hydrogen bonding units, pi-pi stacking interactions, and intrinsic fluorescence, making them versatile in biomolecular recognition, sensing, and as components of supramolecular systems.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles are part of the broader supramolecular host class, with macrocycles being applied in biomolecule recognition, sensing scaffolds, nanostructures, and artificial light harvesting systems, while cages are more specialized for guest accommodation and encapsulation.', 'The synthesis of macrocycles often involves high-temperature condensation reactions, such as glycouril condensation under acidic conditions, and their structural features include aromatic rings, hydrogen bonding units, and the ability to form inclusion complexes, which are critical for their function in molecular recognition and sensing.', 'The properties of macrocycles such as affinity (micromolar to nanomolar range), rigidity, and the presence of functional groups influence their application in targeted recognition, sensing, and molecular interactions, with some macrocycles exhibiting intrinsic fluorescence and pi-pi stacking interactions.'], 'relationships': ['Cage molecules can accommodate indole_ring OR ala_methyl_group, indicating their role in guest encapsulation.', 'Macrocycles have properties such as apolar surface, hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, and intrinsic fluorescence, which are essential for their applications in biomolecular recognition and sensing.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles are used in molecular recognition, but macrocycles have broader applications including biomolecule recognition, sensing, and artificial light harvesting systems.', "Macrocycles' structural features like aromatic rings, hydrogen bonding units, and ability to form inclusion complexes are related to their diverse applications in supramolecular chemistry.", "Cage molecules' limited conformational flexibility and high preorganization make them suitable for selective guest binding, while macrocycles' structural diversity allows for broader functional applications."]}
