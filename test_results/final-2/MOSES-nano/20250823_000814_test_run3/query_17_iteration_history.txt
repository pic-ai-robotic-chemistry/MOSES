Their three-dimensional, cavity-containing structures enable selective binding of specific molecules or ions, making them valuable in separation processes and catalysis. Macrocycles, including cyclodextrins, crown ethers, and porphyrins, are extensively used in molecular recognition, as ligands in catalysis, and in drug delivery systems due to their ability to form stable complexes with various guest molecules.
