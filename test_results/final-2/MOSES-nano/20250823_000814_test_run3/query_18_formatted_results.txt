{'summary': 'Aromatic macrocycles, calixarenes, porphyrins, and macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils are known to bind anions primarily through non-covalent interactions, including anion-π interactions, facilitated by their large, electron-rich, or aromatic cavities.', 'key_points': ['Aromatic macrocycles, including calixarenes and porphyrins, are capable of anion binding via non-covalent interactions, notably anion-π interactions, due to their aromatic and electron-rich nature.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8) and pillararenes possess large, rigid, and symmetric cavities that enable encapsulation of anions and facilitate anion-π interactions.', 'Calixarenes and cucurbiturils have cavities described as hydrophobic or nano-sized, with macrocyclic structures that can form host-guest complexes with anions, often stabilized by multiple non-covalent interactions.', 'Porphyrins and metal porphyrins exhibit properties such as dimerization, spectral shifts, and frontier orbital interactions that can support anion binding, including through π-electronic interactions.', 'Water-soluble macrocyclic hosts, including derivatives of calixarenes and cucurbiturils, are extensively studied for their ability to recognize and bind anions in aqueous environments, often through anion-π interactions, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic effects.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts such as aromatic macrocycles and macrocyclic compounds are designed to recognize and bind anions through various non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, and anion-π interactions. Aromatic macrocycles like calixarenes and porphyrins are particularly notable for their π-electronic surfaces, which can stabilize anions via anion-π interactions, a non-covalent attraction between the electron-deficient regions of aromatic surfaces and negatively charged species. Macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8) and pillararenes are characterized by their large, symmetric, and often hydrophobic cavities, which can encapsulate anions and support anion-π interactions through their electron-rich or aromatic components. These hosts are often water-soluble derivatives, enabling recognition in aqueous media, which is critical for biological and environmental applications. The structural features, cavity size, and electronic properties of these macrocycles determine their selectivity and binding affinity for specific anions, with some designed explicitly to exploit anion-π interactions for enhanced selectivity and binding strength. The properties such as cavity size (large, nano-sized), symmetry (high symmetry), and functional groups (ammonium, carboxylate, charged moieties) are key parameters influencing their binding modes and mechanisms.'], 'relationships': ['Aromatic macrocycles, calixarenes, and porphyrins are structurally capable of supporting anion-π interactions due to their aromatic and electron-rich surfaces.', 'Macrocyclic hosts like cucurbiturils and pillararenes have large, rigid cavities that facilitate encapsulation and stabilization of anions through non-covalent interactions, including anion-π interactions.', 'Water-soluble derivatives of macrocyclic hosts are optimized for recognition and binding of anions in aqueous environments, often leveraging multiple non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and electrostatic effects alongside anion-π interactions.', "The structural features such as cavity size (large, nano-sized), symmetry (high symmetry), and functional groups (ammonium, charged moieties) are critical determinants of the host's ability to bind anions via anion-π interactions."]}
