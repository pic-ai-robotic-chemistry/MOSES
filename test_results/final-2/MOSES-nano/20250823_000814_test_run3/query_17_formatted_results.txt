{'summary': 'Cage molecules are primarily used for selective binding within cavities, but specific applications are not detailed; macrocycles serve as host molecules in supramolecular chemistry, including molecular recognition, sensing, and complexation.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules are defined as structures with cavities large enough to accommodate multiple residues for selective binding, but no specific applications are provided.', 'Macrocycles are large ring-shaped molecules capable of hosting other molecules within their cavities, with extensive applications in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, sensing scaffolds, nanostructures, and supramolecular systems.', 'Macrocycles such as CB7, calixarenes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils are used in host-guest complex formation, fluorescence enhancement, and recognition of peptides, proteins, cations, and small organic molecules.', 'Quantitative affinity data include high affinity (nM range) for certain biomolecules, and macrocycles can form stable complexes with peptides, amino acids, and other guest molecules.', 'Macrocycles are also used in the development of sensors, fluorescent probes, and in supramolecular host-dye systems, with some macrocycles capable of binding methylated lysines and organophosphonates.'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles are extensively studied for their ability to form host-guest complexes, with applications in chemical sensing, molecular recognition, and supramolecular assembly.', 'They can self-assemble in aqueous environments to isolate aromatic hydrocarbon isomers and can be designed for high affinity binding (nanomolar to micromolar range).', 'Macrocycles such as CB(7), calixarenes, and pillararenes are used as supramolecular hosts, often characterized by their large cavities, preorganization, and controlled flexibility.', "The macrocycle's cavity often drives binding through hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonds, and ionic interactions, with some macrocycles designed for selective recognition of peptides, amino acids, or organophosphates.", 'Applications extend to biomolecular interaction studies, receptor design, and detoxification, with some macrocycles serving as synthetic receptors or biomimetic models.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles serve as host molecules in supramolecular chemistry, with their large cavities enabling selective binding of various guest molecules.', 'Cage molecules, while structurally similar in providing cavities for binding, lack specific application details in the source, but are conceptually related to macrocycles in their binding function.', 'Both macrocycles and cages are used in molecular recognition and sensing, but macrocycles have a broader documented range of applications including fluorescence enhancement, peptide recognition, and nanostructure formation.', 'The structural features of macrocycles, such as their large, preorganized cavities, underpin their diverse applications in host-guest chemistry, whereas cages are primarily defined by their cavity size and binding selectivity without specified applications.']}
