{'summary': 'Supramolecular hosts known to bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions include macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8, cucurbit(n)uril) and resorcinarene derivatives, which can facilitate anion recognition via electron-deficient π-systems.', 'key_points': ['Cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8, cucurbit(n)uril) are highly symmetric, rigid macrocyclic hosts capable of anion binding, often involving anion-π interactions driven by high-energy water and electrostatic potential.', 'Resorcinarene and its derivatives, including water-soluble deep cavitands, are macrocyclic hosts with cavities suitable for anion recognition, potentially through anion-π interactions especially when functionalized with electron-withdrawing groups like cyano.', 'Calixarenes, especially sulfonate calix(n)arenes, are also relevant macrocyclic hosts, with their binding properties modifiable through rim modifications, although their primary interactions are often through hydrogen bonding and electrostatics.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as cavitands and deep cavitands can form complexes with anions, with some evidence suggesting the involvement of anion-π interactions, particularly when electron-rich or electron-deficient aromatic walls are present.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are non-covalent interactions where anions interact with electron-deficient π-systems, often stabilized by macrocyclic hosts with aromatic or heteroaromatic cavities. These interactions are increasingly recognized as important in supramolecular chemistry for selective anion recognition and sensing.', 'Cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8) are among the most studied macrocyclic hosts for anion binding, characterized by their rigid, symmetric structures with carbonyl portals that can engage in ion-dipole and anion-π interactions, especially in aqueous environments where high-energy water molecules influence binding affinity.', 'Resorcinarenes and calixarenes are versatile macrocyclic scaffolds that can be functionalized to enhance anion binding, with some derivatives designed explicitly to promote anion-π interactions by incorporating electron-deficient aromatic walls or substituents that modulate the electron density of the cavity.', 'Deep cavitands and cavitands are specialized macrocyclic hosts with well-defined binding pockets, capable of engaging in various non-covalent interactions, including anion-π, especially when their aromatic walls are electron-deficient or suitably functionalized.'], 'relationships': ['Cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8) are involved in host-guest interactions with amino acids, peptides, and proteins, often through ion-dipole and anion-π interactions.', 'Resorcinarenes and calixarenes are structurally related macrocyclic hosts that can be modified to enhance anion-π interactions, with their cavities providing a microenvironment conducive to such interactions.', 'Water-soluble macrocyclic hosts, including deep cavitands and cavitands, are designed to operate in aqueous media, where high-energy water influences the binding mechanisms, including anion-π interactions.', 'The structural features such as electron-deficient aromatic walls and the presence of carbonyl portals in cucurbiturils facilitate anion-π interactions, which are further stabilized by the high symmetry and rigidity of these macrocycles.']}
