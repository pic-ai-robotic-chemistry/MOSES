{'summary': 'Supramolecular hosts known to bind primarily through cation-π interactions include macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and synthetic macrocyclic molecules, which are often designed for high affinity and selectivity towards methylated amino acids and proteins.', 'key_points': ['Calixarene-based hosts, including sulfonatocalixarenes, are prominent supramolecular hosts that engage in cation-π interactions, especially with methylated amino acids like trimethyllysine and methylated histone proteins.', 'These hosts are characterized by their ability to discriminate methylation states, with binding affinities reaching the micromolar range (e.g., 27 μM for trimethyllysine), and often operate via multipoint hydrophobic interactions that facilitate cation-π binding.', 'Cucurbiturils and other macrocyclic hosts are also known to participate in cation-π interactions, with their binding surfaces smaller than typical proteins, enabling selective recognition of methylated biological targets.', 'The design of these hosts often mimics natural recognition processes, inspired by nature, and they are used in chemical biology and biochemistry for applications such as methylation state discrimination and sequestration of methylated proteins.'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are non-covalent binding forces where a cation interacts with the electron-rich π-system of aromatic rings, playing a crucial role in biological recognition, especially in methylated amino acids and proteins.', 'Supramolecular hosts such as calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and macrocyclic molecules are engineered to exploit cation-π interactions for selective binding, often in aqueous, biologically relevant environments.', 'Calixarenes, particularly sulfonatocalixarenes, are versatile and widely studied for their ability to bind methylated lysines and histones, with selectivity influenced by their hydrophobic and aromatic surface properties.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are often designed for high affinity and selectivity, with binding affinities in the low micromolar range, and are used to disrupt or study biological processes involving methylation, such as chromatin regulation.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarene hosts, including sulfonatocalixarenes, are structurally suited for cation-π interactions due to their aromatic, macrocyclic framework.', 'These hosts are often designed to target methylated amino acids (e.g., trimethyllysine) and methylated histone proteins, which are key in epigenetic regulation.', 'Cation-π interactions complement hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, enhancing binding specificity and strength in aqueous environments.', 'The structural features of macrocyclic hosts, such as their size, aromatic surface area, and functional groups, directly influence their ability to engage in cation-π interactions with biological targets.']}
