{'summary': 'Molecules that typically act as guests for supramolecular hosts include organic molecules with aromatic and hydrophilic or hydrophobic side groups, as well as ionic species, often characterized by specific binding motifs and properties such as hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and π-π interactions.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules encompass organic compounds with aromatic moieties, hydrophilic, hydrophobic, or positively charged side groups, and ionic species.', 'Quantitative properties such as octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) and solubility in water influence guest-host interactions.', ' Specific binding interactions include π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding, and inclusion within hydrophobic cavities, exemplified by cucurbiturils and cyclophanes.', 'Encapsulation often involves macrocyclic structures like cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and macrocycles, which provide hydrophobic cavities for guest inclusion.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts are designed to recognize and bind guest molecules through non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic effects.', 'Organic guest molecules often contain aromatic rings, which facilitate π-π interactions with host molecules such as cucurbiturils and cyclophanes.', 'Ionic guest molecules are stabilized within host cavities through electrostatic interactions and ion-dipole interactions, often requiring counterions like bromide.', 'The affinity and selectivity of guest molecules depend on their physicochemical properties, including hydrophobicity (log P), solubility, and the presence of specific functional groups.'], 'relationships': ['Guest molecules are often encapsulated by macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and macrocycles.', 'Binding interactions are influenced by molecular features like aromatic moieties, side groups, and charge states.', 'The structural compatibility between guest molecules and host cavities determines the stability and specificity of the host-guest complex.']}
