{'summary': 'Cage molecules primarily serve as hosts for specific guest molecules, such as indole rings and methyl groups, enabling applications in molecular encapsulation and selective binding, whereas macrocycles are extensively used in guest exchange, biomolecule recognition, and supramolecular assemblies, with overlapping uses in host-guest chemistry.', 'key_points': ['Macrocycles are characterized by their ability to form inclusion complexes, host-guest interactions, and participate in supramolecular structures, with applications in biomolecule recognition, sensing, and nanostructures.', 'Cage molecules are designed to accommodate specific molecular entities like indole rings and methyl groups, facilitating their use in molecular encapsulation, catalysis, and targeted delivery.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles can form inclusion complexes, but macrocycles are more broadly applied in dynamic host-guest systems and recognition processes, while cages are often used for encapsulation of larger or specific guest molecules.'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles, such as cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, and calixarenes, are cyclic compounds with a defined cavity that enable selective binding and encapsulation of guest molecules, often used in drug delivery, sensing, and nanotechnology.', 'Cage molecules, including metal-organic cages (MOCs) and organic cages, are three-dimensional structures capable of accommodating larger or more complex guests, with applications in catalysis, molecular separation, and targeted drug delivery.', 'The structural features of macrocycles, such as aromatic rings and flexible cavities, facilitate π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions, which are critical for their binding properties.', 'Cage molecules often have rigid, well-defined cavities that can be tailored for specific guest sizes and shapes, enabling their use in selective encapsulation and controlled release systems.'], 'relationships': ['Both cage molecules and macrocycles are used in host-guest chemistry, but macrocycles are more versatile in dynamic recognition and sensing applications.', 'Cage molecules can be viewed as specialized macrocyclic structures with three-dimensional cavities designed for larger or specific guests.', 'Applications such as biomolecule recognition and sensing are common to macrocycles, while cage molecules are more prominent in encapsulation and separation technologies.', 'Structural features like aromatic surfaces and hydrophobic cavities are common in macrocycles, whereas cages are characterized by their ability to accommodate specific molecular entities like indole rings and methyl groups, indicating overlapping uses in molecular encapsulation.']}
