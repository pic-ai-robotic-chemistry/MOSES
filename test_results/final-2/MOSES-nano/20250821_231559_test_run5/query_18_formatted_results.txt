{'summary': 'Supramolecular hosts known to bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions include macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes, cavitands, resorcinarenes, cucurbiturils, and related macrocyclic systems, which often feature electron-rich cavities and specific functional groups facilitating these interactions.', 'key_points': ['Macrocyclic hosts like calixarenes, cavitands, resorcinarenes, and cucurbiturils are prominent classes involved in anion-π interactions.', 'These hosts typically possess electron-rich cavities, high symmetry, and functional groups such as phenol, cyano, or amide groups that enhance anion binding via anion-π interactions.', 'Structural features such as hydrophobic or nano-sized cavities, and specific conformations (e.g., vase, kite) are conducive to stabilizing anions through anion-π interactions.', 'Water-soluble variants and derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups are also capable of engaging in such interactions, often used in chemosensing and molecular recognition applications.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are non-covalent interactions where anions are stabilized near electron-deficient π-systems, but in some cases, electron-rich π-systems can also participate through specific geometries and functional groups.', 'Supramolecular hosts such as calixarenes, cavitands, and cucurbiturils are extensively studied for their ability to recognize and bind anions, often through multiple interaction modes including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and π-interactions.', 'The structural features that favor anion-π interactions include high symmetry, electron-rich cavities, and functional groups capable of modulating the electronic environment of the cavity.', 'Macrocyclic hosts with large, hydrophobic, and electron-rich cavities are particularly effective for binding anions via anion-π interactions, especially when functionalized with electron-withdrawing groups to tune the electronic properties.'], 'relationships': ['Many macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes, cavitands, and cucurbiturils are structurally related as cyclic, macrocyclic compounds with defined cavities.', 'These hosts often share a common feature of high symmetry and the ability to form host-guest complexes with aromatic or anionic guests.', 'Functional groups like phenol, cyano, and amide groups are frequently introduced to enhance anion binding through electronic effects, including anion-π interactions.', 'Water-soluble derivatives expand the applicability of these hosts in biological and sensing contexts, where aqueous environments are essential.']}
