{'summary': 'Molecules that typically act as guests for supramolecular hosts include hydrophobic, aromatic, amino acids, peptides, and various organic molecules with specific size, shape, and functional group compatibilities.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules often possess hydrophobic surfaces, aromatic rings, or specific functional groups such as methyllysine, amino acids, or peptides, which facilitate non-covalent interactions within host cavities.', 'Quantitative affinity data indicate that guest binding affinities can range from nanomolar to kcal/mol levels, with hydrophobic effects and shape complementarity being primary driving forces.', 'Structural features such as conformation flexibility (e.g., U-shaped, J-shaped), cavity size (e.g., 200–300 Å^3 for cucurbiturils, large cavities for calixarenes), and surface properties (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) critically influence guest compatibility and binding strength.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts like cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, and resorcinarenes are designed to recognize and encapsulate specific guest molecules through non-covalent interactions such as hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and electrostatic interactions.', 'The affinity and selectivity of guest binding are often governed by the geometric and electronic complementarity between host cavities and guest molecules, with parameters such as cavity volume (e.g., 200–300 Å^3 for cucurbiturils) and surface hydrophobicity playing key roles.', 'Methodologies such as NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and fluorescence assays are employed to quantify binding thermodynamics, conformational changes, and selectivity profiles, providing detailed insights into host-guest chemistry.'], 'relationships': ['Hydrophobic and aromatic molecules are frequently targeted as guests due to their favorable interactions with hydrophobic cavities and π-systems in hosts.', 'Amino acids and peptides are common biological guests, often recognized via shape complementarity and specific functional group interactions, such as methyllysine recognition by calixarenes and cucurbiturils.', 'Structural parameters like cavity size, shape (bowl, toroidal, funnel-shaped), and surface properties (hydrophobic/hydrophilic) are critical determinants of guest compatibility, with affinities spanning from weak (1.6–5.7 kcal/mol for anions in cucurbiturils) to high (nanomolar range in macrocyclic systems).']}
