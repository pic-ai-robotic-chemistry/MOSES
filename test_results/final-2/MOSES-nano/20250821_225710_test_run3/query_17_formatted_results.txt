{'summary': 'Cage molecules primarily serve as hosts for specific guest molecules like indole rings and methyl groups, facilitating inclusion complex formation, while macrocycles are versatile in molecular recognition, sensing, and supramolecular applications, often involving host-guest interactions and functional modifications.', 'key_points': ['Macrocycles are extensively used in molecular recognition, sensing, and as components of artificial light-harvesting systems, with properties such as intrinsic fluorescence, hydrogen bonding, and aromatic surfaces that enable specific interactions with biomolecules and synthetic guests.', 'Macrocycles can form inclusion complexes, exhibit high affinity for amino acids and peptides, and participate in guest exchange processes, making them valuable in biomolecular recognition and supramolecular chemistry.', 'Cage molecules are characterized by their ability to accommodate specific structural motifs such as indole rings and methyl groups, indicating their role in selective encapsulation and host-guest chemistry.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles can form inclusion complexes, but macrocycles have broader applications in sensing, light harvesting, and molecular recognition, whereas cages are more specialized for encapsulation of particular guest structures.'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles are cyclic compounds with a large ring size, often used as supramolecular hosts due to their ability to bind specific guest molecules through non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic effects. They are integral to fields like artificial light harvesting, biomolecular recognition, and sensor development.', 'Cage molecules are typically three-dimensional, polyhedral structures capable of encapsulating guest molecules within their cavities. They are used in selective encapsulation, drug delivery, and as molecular containers for specific functional groups like indole rings and methyl groups.', 'Both classes are part of the broader field of supramolecular chemistry, which studies non-covalent interactions and self-assembly processes. Macrocycles often serve as building blocks for more complex supramolecular architectures, including cages.', 'The structural features such as aromatic surfaces, hydrogen bonding units, and hydrophobic cavities are critical for the function of macrocycles in recognition and sensing applications. Cages, with their ability to accommodate specific structural motifs, are tailored for selective encapsulation, which is essential in applications like targeted delivery and molecular separation.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles and cages both participate in host-guest chemistry, but macrocycles are more versatile in recognition and sensing due to their functional groups and structural flexibility.', 'Macrocycles can be integrated into nanostructures and sensing scaffolds, enhancing their application scope in biomolecular recognition and artificial systems.', 'Cage molecules are specialized for accommodating particular guest structures, such as indole rings and methyl groups, indicating a focus on selective encapsulation rather than broad recognition.', 'Both classes can form inclusion complexes, but macrocycles are often used in dynamic processes like guest exchange, whereas cages are more static containers for specific guests.']}
