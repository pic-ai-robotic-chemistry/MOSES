{'summary': 'Supramolecular hosts known to bind primarily through cation-π interactions include calixarenes, cucurbiturils, crown ethers, macrocyclic hosts, and aromatic surfaces, each exhibiting specific structural features conducive to such interactions.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes, especially calixarene derivatives, demonstrate affinity for methylated lysine and peptide recognition, with their binding often involving hydrophobic cavities and aromatic units that facilitate cation-π interactions.', 'Cucurbiturils, notably CB8 and CB6, form complexes with cationic guests such as methylene blue and peptides, utilizing their macrocyclic cavities to stabilize cation-π interactions, especially with aromatic amino acids like tyrosine and phenylalanine.', 'Crown ethers, including tetrasulfonated variants, possess cation-complexing properties primarily through their ether oxygen atoms and macrocyclic structure, which can engage in cation-π interactions with ammonium and other cationic guests.', 'Macrocyclic hosts, encompassing various classes such as cyclophanes and pillararenes, are designed with cavities and functional groups that promote non-covalent interactions, including cation-π, especially with organic and inorganic cations.', 'Aromatic surfaces, when exposed and stacked, driven by solvophobic effects, can serve as non-specific but effective sites for cation-π interactions, often in the context of supramolecular assemblies.'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are a type of non-covalent interaction where a cation is stabilized by the electron-rich π-system of an aromatic ring. These interactions are crucial in biological recognition, catalysis, and molecular sensing.', 'Supramolecular hosts such as calixarenes and cucurbiturils are macrocyclic compounds with well-defined cavities that can accommodate various guests, often stabilized through multiple non-covalent interactions including cation-π, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic forces.', 'Crown ethers are macrocyclic polyethers that preferentially bind cations like Na+ and K+ via their oxygen atoms, but their aromatic derivatives can also engage in cation-π interactions, especially with larger or more complex cations.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are extensively studied for their ability to mimic biological receptors, with their cavity size, shape, and functional groups tailored to optimize specific interactions, including cation-π, which is often exploited in sensor design and drug delivery.', 'Aromatic surfaces, especially when exposed and stacked, can facilitate cation-π interactions in the context of nanostructures and molecular assemblies, driven by solvophobic effects and π-electron cloud stabilization.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes and cucurbiturils are both macrocyclic hosts that can stabilize cationic guests through their cavity interactions, with calixarenes often engaging in π-π and cation-π interactions due to their aromatic units.', 'Crown ethers, while primarily known for ion complexation via ether oxygens, can also participate in cation-π interactions when functionalized with aromatic groups, broadening their binding repertoire.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as cyclophanes and pillararenes are structurally designed to promote non-covalent interactions, including cation-π, especially when their cavities are lined with aromatic or electron-rich groups.', 'Aromatic surfaces, when exposed and stacked, can serve as non-specific platforms for cation-π interactions, often in conjunction with other non-covalent forces in supramolecular assemblies.']}
