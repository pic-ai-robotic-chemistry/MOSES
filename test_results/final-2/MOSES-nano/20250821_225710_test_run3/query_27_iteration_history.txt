[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': "The query 'What are the main factors controlling host-guest interaction?' is asking for the key variables and mechanisms that influence how a host molecule (such as a cavity, cage, or receptor) interacts with a guest molecule (such as a ligand, analyte, or substrate). Based on the tool analysis, relevant classes likely include 'Host-guest chemistry', 'Molecular recognition', 'Supramolecular chemistry', and specific host types like 'Cucurbiturils', 'Cyclodextrins', or 'Calixarenes'. These classes are rich in information about the structural, electronic, and environmental factors that govern binding affinity, selectivity, and stability of host-guest complexes. Therefore, the main factors encompass structural complementarity, non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, π-π stacking, electrostatics), solvent effects, and conformational flexibility of both host and guest molecules.", 'hypothetical_answer': 'Host-guest interactions are primarily governed by a combination of structural and electronic factors that facilitate selective binding. Key factors include: \n\n1. Structural Complementarity: The geometric fit between host cavity and guest molecule, including size, shape, and spatial arrangement.\n2. Non-Covalent Interactions: Hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, van der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions that stabilize the complex.\n3. Electronic Properties: Charge distribution and polarity of both host and guest influence electrostatic attraction or repulsion.\n4. Solvent Effects: The polarity and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium can enhance or hinder binding.\n5.
