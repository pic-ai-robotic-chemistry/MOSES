{'summary': 'When a calixarene containing pyrrole groups binds an anion, the primary non-covalent interactions involved are hydrogen bonding (especially via pyrrole NH groups), anion–π interactions, and electrostatic interactions, with additional contributions from van der Waals forces and the hydrophobic effect within the calixarene cavity.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonding is the most relevant and significant non-covalent interaction for anion binding by calixarenes containing pyrrole groups, with the pyrrole NH acting as a hydrogen bond donor to the anion acceptor (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000739, 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Hydrogen bond distances in such systems are typically in the range of 2.1–2.968 Å, with an average hydrogen bond energy of 23.8 kJ/mol (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000739, 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Anion–π interactions may occur between the anion and the electron-rich aromatic systems of the calixarene or pyrrole units, contributing to anion stabilization within the host cavity.', 'Electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged anion and the electron-rich or polarized regions of the calixarene (including the pyrrole moieties) further stabilize the host–guest complex (DOI: 10.1016/j.tca.2017.08.009, 10.1002/chem.201605394).', 'The hydrophobic concavity of the calixarene macrocycle enables and enhances anion binding by providing a low-polarity environment that favors non-covalent interactions (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Van der Waals interactions and the overall host–guest molecular recognition framework also contribute to the stabilization of the anion–calixarene complex (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Anion binding in these systems can be mediated by sigma-hole interactions, particularly when the calixarene is functionalized with groups capable of generating such regions (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).'], 'background_information': ['Calixarenes are macrocyclic synthetic receptors with a hydrophobic cavity, capable of host–guest molecular recognition, and are widely studied in supramolecular chemistry (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398, 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Pyrrole groups, when incorporated into calixarene frameworks, provide NH hydrogen bond donors that are particularly effective for anion binding due to their directional and strong hydrogen bonding capability.', 'Hydrogen bonding is among the strongest and most influential intermolecular forces in molecular recognition, especially for anion binding, but its strength is attenuated in water and enhanced in organic solvents (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Electrostatic interactions are a driving force for guest location within the calixarene cavity, but their strength and relevance for selectivity can be overwhelmed or modulated by solvent effects and competing interactions (DOI: 10.1039/D0QO00649A, 10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004).', 'Anion–π interactions are a class of non-covalent interactions where anions interact with the π-system of aromatic rings, and are increasingly recognized as important in anion recognition by aromatic-rich hosts.', 'The hydrophobic effect, arising from the exclusion of water from the calixarene cavity, further promotes anion encapsulation and stabilization.', 'Anion binding by calixarene–pyrrole systems is often studied using molecular dynamics simulations, NMR, UV-Vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (DOI: 10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107919, 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Sigma-hole interactions, a type of non-covalent interaction involving regions of positive electrostatic potential on otherwise electronegative atoms, can mediate anion binding in appropriately functionalized calixarenes (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).'], 'relationships': ['The pyrrole NH groups in calixarene derivatives act as hydrogen bond donors, directly interacting with anionic guests via strong, directional hydrogen bonds.', 'The hydrophobic cavity of the calixarene macrocycle not only provides a low-dielectric environment that enhances non-covalent interactions but also enables the spatial preorganization of pyrrole groups for optimal anion binding.', 'Anion–π and electrostatic interactions are synergistic with hydrogen bonding, collectively stabilizing the anion within the host cavity.', 'Sigma-hole interactions may be present if the calixarene is functionalized with groups capable of generating such regions, further enhancing anion affinity and selectivity.', 'The overall host–guest complex stability is a result of the interplay between hydrogen bonding, anion–π, electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions, with the relative contribution of each depending on the specific calixarene structure, solvent, and anion identity.']}
