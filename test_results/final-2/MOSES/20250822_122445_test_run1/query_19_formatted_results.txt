{'summary': 'Supramolecular hosts containing pyrrole units are generally effective at binding anions due to the ability of pyrrole NH groups to act as directional hydrogen bond donors, facilitating strong and selective anion recognition, especially when preorganized in host architectures such as calixpyrroles.', 'key_points': ['Pyrrole units in supramolecular hosts provide NH groups that serve as hydrogen bond donors, enabling strong and directional hydrogen bonding interactions with anions.', 'Calixpyrrole, a prototypical pyrrole-based host, contains multiple NH groups ("has_part: nh_group"), which can simultaneously interact with anionic guests, enhancing binding affinity and selectivity (10.1002/anie.202012315).', 'Anion binding in these systems is mediated by hydrogen bonding and can also involve sigma-hole interactions ("is_mediated_by: sigma_hole_interaction"; 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Preorganization of receptor arms ("restricted intramolecular rotation"; 10.1021/jacs.9b00148) in the host structure increases the effective binding affinity by reducing entropic penalties and aligning hydrogen bond donors for optimal anion recognition.', 'Hydrophobic concavity in the host structure ("is_enabled_by: hydrophobic_concavity"; 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259) further stabilizes anion binding by providing a complementary environment for the guest.', 'Hydrogen bonding in these systems is characterized by a typical hydrogen bond distance of 2.1 Ã… and an average hydrogen bond energy of 23.8 kJ/mol (10.1002/chem.202000739), which are significant for molecular recognition.', 'Hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in molecular recognition, particularly in organic media, but its strength is attenuated in water due to competition with solvent molecules.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts are designed to enable host-guest chemistry and molecular recognition, often using weak interactions such as hydrogen bonding for selectivity.', 'Hydrogen bonding is among the strongest and most influential intermolecular forces for anion binding, protein denaturation, and Hofmeister effects (10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'The effectiveness of hydrogen bonding for anion binding is reduced in aqueous environments ("strength_in_water: weakened"), but can be enhanced in organic media or by preorganization of the host.', 'Anion binding stoichiometry can vary; for example, a 2:1 receptor:I- complex has been observed (10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the mechanisms and dynamics of anion binding in pyrrole-based hosts.', 'Porphyrins, another class of pyrrole-containing macrocycles, are not primarily used for anion binding but are relevant for their structural and electronic properties, such as intense extinction coefficients and defined frontier orbitals.'], 'relationships': ['The presence of multiple pyrrole NH groups in calixpyrrole and related hosts enables cooperative hydrogen bonding to anions, increasing binding strength and selectivity.', 'Preorganization of receptor arms (restricted intramolecular rotation) aligns hydrogen bond donors, reducing entropic costs and enhancing anion binding efficiency.', 'Hydrophobic concavity in the host structure complements the anion guest, further stabilizing the host-guest complex.', 'Sigma-hole interactions can supplement hydrogen bonding in anion recognition, providing additional binding modes.', 'Hydrogen bonding is a key interaction for molecular recognition in supramolecular chemistry, but its effectiveness is modulated by the solvent environment.']}
