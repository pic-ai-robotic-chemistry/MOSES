{'summary': 'The principal classes of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions are calixarenes (including calix(n)arenes and their sulfonated derivatives), cyclophanes, and pillararenes. These hosts utilize aromatic cavities to engage cationic guests, such as methylated lysine and methylated arginine side chains, via cation-π interactions.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes (calix(4)arene, calix(6)arene, calix(8)arene, calix(n)arene) and their derivatives (e.g., sulfonatocalixarenes, p-sulfonatocalix(4)arene) are established supramolecular hosts that bind cationic guests primarily through cation-π interactions involving their aromatic cavities (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Cyclophanes and cyclophane derivatives, including cyclophane receptors (e.g., trivalent receptor 13), are recognized for their ability to host cationic species via cation-π interactions with their aromatic panels.', 'Pillararenes (pillar(5)arene, pillar(6)arene, pillar(7)arene, pillar(n)arene) are macrocyclic hosts with electron-rich aromatic cavities that facilitate cation-π binding of cationic guests.', 'Cation-π interactions in these hosts occur between the aromatic panel of the cavity and cationic groups such as methylated lysine, methylated arginine, and guanidinium groups (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398; DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6b04372).', 'The interaction is favored for monomethylated ammonium ions and is evaluated using n_chx_fragment analysis.', 'Calixarene hosts demonstrate strong binding affinity for trimethyllysine, sufficient to out-compete native reader proteins, and show selectivity for methylation state (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts that utilize cation-π interactions are designed to target complex biological molecules, including amino acids, peptides, and proteins, particularly those with posttranslational methylation (e.g., methylated lysine and arginine).', 'These hosts are often inspired by natural protein recognition motifs and are created via de novo design to function as sequestration agents or pan-specific reagents in chemical biology and biochemistry.', 'Cation-π interactions are classified as weak interactions but can provide high selectivity and strong binding affinity, especially in physiologically relevant media (e.g., warm, salty water).', 'The aromatic cavity of these hosts is smaller than that of proteins, enabling discrimination of methylation states and selectivity for biological targets.', 'Calixarene and pillar[n]arene hosts are compatible with biologically relevant solvents and can function in vivo as sequestration agents for methylated biomolecules.', 'Cation-π binding is particularly effective for guests with methylated ammonium or guanidinium groups, such as those found in methylated lysine and arginine side chains.'], 'relationships': ['Cation-π interactions occur specifically between the aromatic panels of host cavities (e.g., calixarene, cyclophane, pillararene) and cationic groups on guest molecules (e.g., methylated lysine, methylated arginine, guanidinium group).', 'Calixarene hosts (including sulfonatocalixarenes) and pillar[n]arenes are structurally optimized for cation-π recognition, with selectivity for methylation state and strong binding affinity for trimethyllysine.', 'These hosts can out-compete native reader proteins for binding to methylated lysine, demonstrating their high affinity and selectivity.', 'The use of cation-π interactions enables these hosts to discriminate between methylated and unmethylated amino acids, with weak binding to unmethylated forms and strong binding to methylated forms.', 'The design and function of these hosts are inspired by natural protein recognition and are compared to protein counterparts in terms of selectivity, binding affinity, and interaction surface area.']}
