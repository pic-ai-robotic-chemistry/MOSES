{'summary': 'A cryptand is a macrobicyclic ligand that functions as a host molecule capable of encapsulating guest species, particularly in the context of host-guest chemistry and molecular recognition.', 'key_points': ['Cryptands are a class of macrobicyclic ligands, structurally characterized by their ability to encapsulate guest molecules within a three-dimensional cavity.', 'Cryptands are macrocyclic compounds that can be functionalized with dyes such as anthracene and naphthalimide to impart selectivity for specific anions, notably sulfate.', 'Cryptands act as receptors, especially when functionalized, and are capable of binding organic guest molecules (as supported by 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).'], 'background_information': ["The term 'macrobicyclic ligand' refers to ligands containing two or more macrocyclic rings fused or bridged together, creating a preorganized, rigid cavity suitable for guest encapsulation.", "Cryptands are a subclass of both 'macrobicyclic_ligand' and 'receptor', reflecting their dual role in supramolecular chemistry as both structural hosts and functional molecular receptors.", 'Functionalization with anthracene or naphthalimide dyes enables cryptands to achieve selective recognition and binding of specific anions, such as sulfate, through tailored host-guest interactions.', 'The encapsulation of guest molecules by cryptands is a key feature in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and supramolecular chemistry, facilitating selective ion binding and guest encapsulation.'], 'relationships': ['Cryptands are related to the broader class of macrobicyclic ligands, sharing the structural feature of a three-dimensional, preorganized cavity.', 'Cryptands, when functionalized with anthracene or naphthalimide dyes, act as selective receptors for anions such as sulfate.', "The property 'has_guest' indicates that cryptands are capable of encapsulating organic guest molecules, establishing their role in host-guest chemistry (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).", "Cryptands' ability to encapsulate guests and bind ions positions them as important agents in molecular recognition, ion binding, and phase transfer processes within supramolecular chemistry."]}
