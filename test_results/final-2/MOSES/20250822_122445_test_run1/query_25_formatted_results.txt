{'summary': 'Host-guest interactions can induce changes in electrochemical signals through a variety of non-covalent mechanisms, including charge transfer interactions, electrostatic attraction and repulsion, hydrogen bonding, and conformational effects. These interactions modulate electron transfer processes, binding affinities, and physicochemical properties, which are directly transduced into measurable electrochemical responses.', 'key_points': ['Host-guest interactions encompass non-covalent binding between host molecules (e.g., cucurbiturils such as CB(7), CB(8), β-cyclodextrin) and guest molecules (e.g., quinine, methylene blue, amino acids, peptides, 7-dccae), resulting in the formation of host-guest complexes and inclusion complexes.', 'Types of host-guest interactions that induce electrochemical signal changes include: (a) charge transfer interactions (e.g., between electron-rich and electron-deficient aromatics, stabilized by hosts like Q(8)), (b) electrostatic attraction (e.g., between sulfonate groups and organic cations, primary driving force for binding), (c) electrostatic repulsion (e.g., between cationic regions or between negatively charged groups and electronegative host cavities), (d) hydrogen bonding, (e) ion-dipole and dipole-dipole interactions, and (f) size/shape complementarity and cavity interactions.', 'Charge transfer interactions are characterized by the formation of charge transfer complexes (e.g., blue-box cyclophane with aromatic amino acids), often observed by red-shifted absorption bands (e.g., 463 nm, above 555 nm) in UV/Vis spectra, and are stabilized by ionic interactions and macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbit(8)uril).', 'Electrostatic interactions (attraction and repulsion) modulate binding strength and selectivity, with electrostatic attraction being the primary driving force in many host-guest systems (e.g., SR4A5 with bispyridinium guests, CB(7) with Gln), and repulsion influencing conformational stability and complex formation.', 'Host-guest interactions can result in dye displacement, fluorescence modulation, pKa shifts, and stimulus-responsive release, all of which can be transduced into electrochemical signals via indicator displacement assays (IDA) and other sensor strategies.', 'Photoinduced electron transfer (e.g., from Q(8) to AC) can extinguish fluorescence and modulate electrochemical signals, with Q(8) acting as electron donor and AC as acceptor.', 'Electrochemical sensors and sensing platforms based on host-guest interactions are constructed using strategies such as IDA, and are verified by techniques including cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and are characterized by high selectivity, reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven electrodes), and stability (86.47% of original DPV signal retained up to 21 days at 4°C).'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest interactions are a subclass of non-covalent interactions and molecular recognition, central to supramolecular chemistry, and are studied using techniques such as 1H NMR spectroscopy, 2D NOESY NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), microcalorimetric titration, UV absorption spectroscopy, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).', 'Binding affinities and thermodynamic parameters (association constant Ka/ka, binding affinity, binding free energy, enthalpy and entropy changes) are critical for quantifying host-guest interactions and their impact on electrochemical signal modulation.', 'Conformational effects, such as restriction of conformational space by geometric confinement and hydrophobic nature, and conformational parameters (distance, torsion angle), influence the geometry and stability of host-guest complexes, thereby affecting electron transfer processes.', 'Host-guest interactions are effective strategies for preparing biological systems, constructing biomaterials, deciphering molecular binding modes, and developing new disease treatments.', 'Electrochemical sensors based on host-guest interactions are used for detection of analytes such as tryptophan, quinine, nucleotides, hydrazine, and monomethylhydrazine, and are based on nanocomposite materials for enhanced performance.', 'Host-guest displacement (e.g., quinine displacing methylene blue from β-cyclodextrin cavity) is a mechanism for signal transduction in indicator displacement assays, directly affecting electrochemical readouts.'], 'relationships': ['Charge transfer interactions are stabilized by macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbit(8)uril), and the resulting charge transfer complexes are formed in aqueous solution and are stabilized by ionic interactions.', 'Electrostatic attraction and repulsion are both types of electrostatic interactions; attraction is the primary driving force for binding in many systems, while repulsion can be counterbalanced by cation-π interactions and modulated by conformational parameters (e.g., distance between charged groups).', 'Host-guest interactions modulate chemical and physicochemical properties of the system, including electron transfer number and resistance, which are directly linked to electrochemical signal changes.', 'Photoinduced electron transfer processes are enabled by specific host-guest pairings (e.g., Q(8) as donor, AC as acceptor), and result in measurable changes in fluorescence and electrochemical signals.', 'Electrochemical sensors and platforms are constructed based on host-guest interactions and are engineered for specific targets (e.g., quinine, tryptophan), with performance verified by multiple electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques.']}
