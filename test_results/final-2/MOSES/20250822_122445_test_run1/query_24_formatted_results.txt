{'summary': 'Multiple types of host-guest interactions—including charge-transfer interactions, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, metal coordination, encapsulation, and conformational changes—can induce changes in optical signals by modulating fluorescence, absorption, or other optical properties of the system.', 'key_points': ['Charge-transfer interactions and formation of charge-transfer complexes can induce optical changes such as red shifts in absorption spectra; these complexes are stabilized by ionic interactions and are formed in aqueous solution (DOI: 10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107919).', 'Hydrogen bonding, particularly in amphiphilic clefts or cavities and mediated by hydroxyl groups, plays a significant role in molecular recognition and can modulate optical signals; hydrogen bond distance is typically 2.1 Å with an average bond energy of 23.8 kJ/mol (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000739).', 'Encapsulation of guest molecules (e.g., alkyl moieties, indole moieties, chromophoric molecules) by hosts such as iQ(7) or CB(7) can result in changes in fluorescence intensity, fluorescence quenching, and shielding of excited singlet states (e.g., Q[7] cavity shields excited singlet state of PAL; DOI: 10.1016/j.saa.2020.118177).', 'Conformational changes in host or guest molecules, tracked by fluorescence, can modulate optical signals (DOI: 10.1039/D0QO00649A).', 'Fluorescence modulation can be caused by dye displacement events within host-guest systems.', 'Host-guest interactions are analyzed by fluorescence data, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and 1H NMR spectroscopy, and are effective for deciphering molecular binding modes and constructing biomaterials.', 'Host-guest displacement (e.g., quinine displacing methylene blue from β-cyclodextrin cavity) can result in optical signal changes.', 'Encapsulation processes are measured by fluorescence quenching and observed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest chemistry occurs in aqueous solution and is investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, 1H NMR, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201800587; 10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107919).', 'Supramolecular host-guest interactions often involve macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils, calixarenes, cyclodextrins) and a variety of guests, including chromophoric molecules and dyes.', 'Hydrogen bonding is among the strongest and most influential intermolecular forces, but its strength is attenuated in water; it is significant in anion binding, protein denaturation, and Hofmeister effects (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Encapsulation can result in complexes with linear or folded structures, and association constants, stoichiometry, and thermodynamic parameters are determined for specific host-guest pairs (e.g., calix(n)arene and ethidium bromide; DOI: 10.1007/s10847-018-0786-0).', 'Metal coordination is applied to cavitands and can influence optical properties (DOI: 10.1021/acs.joc.1c00794).', 'Supramolecular interactions are the basis of response mechanisms in optical sensing and signal translation.'], 'relationships': ['Charge-transfer complexes are formed exclusively by charge-transfer interactions and are stabilized by ionic interactions, leading to observable optical changes such as red shifts.', 'Encapsulation by macrocyclic hosts (e.g., CB(7), iQ(7)) of chromophoric or fluorescent guests modulates fluorescence intensity and can protect against quenching and radiationless transitions.', 'Hydrogen bonding partners (e.g., pyridine dicarboxamide, carbonyl) and the presence of water as a medium influence the feasibility and strength of hydrogen-bond-driven optical changes.', 'Conformational changes in host or guest molecules, as a result of host-guest binding, are directly tracked by changes in fluorescence, linking structural dynamics to optical signal modulation.', 'Dye displacement within host cavities (e.g., β-cyclodextrin) translates molecular recognition events into optical signal changes, providing a mechanism for optical sensing.']}
