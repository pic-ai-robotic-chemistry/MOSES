[{'retry_count': 0, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': "The query is asking whether there are known supramolecular host molecules that are based on calixarene scaffolds and have been chemically modified to include pyrrole functional groups. The focus is on the intersection of calixarene chemistry (a well-known class of macrocyclic hosts) and the incorporation of pyrrole units, which could influence the host's binding properties or introduce new functionalities. The tool analysis confirms that 'calixarene' is the most information-rich and relevant class for this query, indicating that the main context is calixarene-based supramolecular chemistry.", 'hypothetical_answer': 'Yes, there are known supramolecular hosts that are derivatives of calixarenes and feature pyrrole functional groups. Calixarenes are a prominent class of macrocyclic compounds widely used as supramolecular hosts due to their tunable cavity size and versatile functionalization. Chemists have synthesized various calixarene derivatives where pyrrole rings are introduced either at the upper or lower rim, or as bridging units between phenolic subunits. These pyrrole-functionalized calixarenes can exhibit enhanced binding properties, selective recognition of anions or cations, and unique photophysical or electrochemical behaviors. For example, calix[4]arene derivatives bearing pyrrole groups have been reported to act as selective receptors for anions via hydrogen bonding and π-interactions. Such modifications expand the utility of calixarenes in molecular recognition, sensing, and catalysis.', 'key_concepts': ['calixarene', 'supramolecular host', 'macrocyclic chemistry', 'pyrrole

Calixarenes are a prominent class of macrocyclic compounds widely used as supramolecular hosts due to their tunable cavity size and versatile functionalization.

These pyrrole-functionalized calixarenes can exhibit enhanced binding properties, selective recognition of anions or cations, and unique photophysical or electrochemical behaviors. For example, calix[4]arene derivatives bearing pyrrole groups have been reported to act as selective receptors for anions via hydrogen bonding and π-interactions.

This community covers the general concept of synthetic hosts that bind guests via non-covalent interactions, with a focus on selectivity and affinity.\n- Calixarene Community: Includes calixarene, calixarene_derivative, calixarene_host, calixarene_chemistry, calixarene_macrocycle, calixarene_molecule, calixarene_receptor, calixarene_compound. This community covers the structure, chemistry, and host properties of calixarenes and their derivatives, including their use as macrocyclic hosts and their ability to bind various guests.\n- Macrocyclic Host Community: Includes macrocyclic_chemistry, macrocyclic_host, macrocyclic_compound, macrocyclic_molecule, macrocyclic_receptor, macrocyclic_host_molecule. This community provides broader context for macrocyclic hosts, their structural features, and their use in molecular recognition and host-guest chemistry.\n- Pyrrole Community: Includes pyrrole, pyrrole_moiety. This community is focused on the presence and functional role of pyrrole groups in host molecules, especially in the context of molecular recognition.\n\n2. Information Completeness by Community:\n- Supramolecular Host: Well covered in terms of general properties, function, and relevance to host-guest chemistry. No explicit mention of calixarene-pyrrole derivatives, but the role of supramolecular hosts is clear.\n- Calixarene: Extensive coverage of calixarene structure, chemistry, and host properties. There is mention of derivatives and their functionalization, but no explicit reference to pyrrole-functionalized calixarenes. The information does note that calixarene derivatives are easily synthesized and can be functionalized for specific recognition tasks.\n- Macrocyclic Host: Broadly covered, with context for macrocyclic hosts and their functionalization. Calixarenes are specifically mentioned as a key class within this community. No explicit mention of pyrrole groups in macrocyclic hosts.\n- Pyrrole: Very limited coverage. The only relevant information is that a pyrrole moiety can be used for monitoring binding via spectroscopic changes, but there is no direct connection to calixarene derivatives or supramolecular hosts.\n\n3. Missing Communities:\n- There is no explicit community or information fragment that directly addresses the existence or examples of calixarene derivatives featuring pyrrole functional groups. There is also no coverage of specific synthetic strategies or literature examples of such compounds.\n\n4. Cross-Community Relationships and Gaps:\n- The structural details confirm that calixarenes are widely functionalized and used as supramolecular hosts, and that pyrrole moieties can be used in molecular recognition. However, there is no explicit cross-reference or example connecting calixarene derivatives with pyrrole groups. The potential for such derivatives is implied by the ease of calixarene functionalization, but not confirmed.\n\n5. Satisfactory Answer Assessment:\n- The user cannot get a definitive answer to their question from the current information. While the results confirm that calixarenes are functionalized as supramolecular hosts and that pyrrole moieties are relevant in molecular recognition, there is no explicit evidence or example of calixarene derivatives featuring pyrrole groups. The connection is only implicit, not explicit.\n\nOverall, the information is conceptually broad and covers the relevant host and functional group communities, but lacks the specific cross-community example or confirmation required to fully satisfy the query.', requirements_fulfilled=False), 'timestamp': '2025-08-22T12:28:34.692262', 'messages': [SystemMessage(content='Generated hypothetical document to aid in query understanding: The query is asking whether there are known supramolecular host molecules that are based on calixare...', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5354dec3-1a77-4a54-9d25-d809b6ea7515'), SystemMessage(content='Query normalized: Are there known supramolecular hosts that are derivatives of calixarenes and also feature pyrrole functional groups?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='4989cce5-9c27-4824-9eb0-e39fa1d9c71f'), SystemMessage(content='Entity refinement not needed', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='da2b832d-773d-41db-bce1-539d2c237d2c'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='c4952194-f3a6-4056-b6ed-4c54fd4cba3e'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='df262871-6d77-4ae0-be2f-1f79bb3b8552'), SystemMessage(content='Results validation warning: Single tool evaluation with community guidance', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='8f787b2f-d13a-4b14-b50a-82e030554cc2'), SystemMessage(content='Refiner decision: retry - Generated 1 actionable hints for 1 tool calls (retry #1)', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='703fe838-d48a-4156-a592-84b6f413d120'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='61b55d51-99d2-40be-842d-b96e4671b0c3'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='231130f9-0704-401b-b613-c637f6a3bd97')]}, {'retry_count': 2, 'hypothetical_document': {'interpretation': "The query is asking whether there are known supramolecular host molecules that are based on calixarene scaffolds and have been chemically modified to include pyrrole functional groups.

Calixarenes are a prominent class of macrocyclic compounds widely used as supramolecular hosts due to their tunable cavity size and versatile functionalization. Chemists have synthesized various calixarene derivatives where pyrrole rings are introduced either at the upper or lower rim, or as bridging units between phenolic subunits. These pyrrole-functionalized calixarenes can exhibit enhanced binding properties, selective recognition of anions or cations, and unique photophysical or electrochemical behaviors. For example, calix[4]arene derivatives bearing pyrrole groups have been reported to act as selective receptors for anions via hydrogen bonding and π-interactions.

Pyrrole Community: Includes \'pyrrole\', \'pyrrole_moiety\'.\n\nD. Macrocyclic Chemistry Community: Includes \'macrocyclic_chemistry\'.\n\n2. Information Coverage by Community:\n\nA. Supramolecular Host Community: \n- Well covered in terms of general properties, host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and the role of macrocyclic hosts. \n- Macrocyclic hosts are described as being easily functionalizable, with a variety of functional groups possible, and calixarene is listed as a subtype. \n- No explicit mention of pyrrole-functionalized hosts, but the framework for functionalization is present.\n\nB. Calixarene Community:\n- Extensive detail on calixarene structure, derivatization capability ("almost unlimited"), and the existence of many derivatives. \n- Calixarene derivatives are described as having various substituents (e.g., phenyl, methoxy, cyano, carbamoyl), and functional groups (hydrophilic, charged, etc.), but there is no explicit mention of pyrrole or pyrrole moieties as substituents or functional groups.\n- Calixarene derivatives are confirmed as supramolecular hosts and are used in molecular recognition and host-guest chemistry.\n\nC. Pyrrole Community:\n- Pyrrole and pyrrole moiety are present as entities, but there is no information provided about their incorporation into calixarene derivatives or supramolecular hosts.\n- No explicit cross-linking to calixarene or macrocyclic hosts in the current data.\n\nD. Macrocyclic Chemistry Community:\n- General context is provided, with macrocyclic chemistry as a specialization of supramolecular chemistry and a focus on inclusion phenomena. No specific link to pyrrole-functionalized calixarene derivatives.\n\n3. Cross-Community Relationships and Gaps:\n- There is a strong structural and functional link between the supramolecular host and calixarene communities, with calixarene derivatives being a major class of macrocyclic hosts.\n- The data confirms that calixarene derivatives can be extensively functionalized, but the only explicitly listed substituents are phenyl, methoxy, cyano, and carbamoyl. Pyrrole is not mentioned as a substituent or functional group in any calixarene derivative.\n- The pyrrole community is isolated: while pyrrole is present as a concept, there is no evidence in the data that pyrrole-functionalized calixarene derivatives exist or are known as supramolecular hosts.\n- No explicit example or property restriction links calixarene derivatives to pyrrole or pyrrole moieties.\n\n4. Missing Communities or Information:\n- The main missing link is explicit evidence or examples of calixarene derivatives featuring pyrrole functional groups. The current data does not provide this connection, nor does it list pyrrole as a known substituent or functional group in calixarene derivatives.\n- No references to specific literature or examples of pyrrole-calixarene hosts.\n\n5. Satisfactoriness of the Answer:\n- The user can learn that calixarene derivatives are a major, highly functionalizable class of supramolecular hosts, and that a wide range of substituents is possible. However, the data does not confirm the existence of pyrrole-functionalized calixarene hosts, nor does it provide examples or direct evidence for this specific combination.\n- The answer is therefore incomplete for the user\'s specific query: the existence of calixarene derivatives with pyrrole groups as supramolecular hosts is not confirmed or denied, but simply not addressed in the current data.\n\nConclusion: The current information is conceptually rich regarding calixarene hosts and their derivatization, but lacks the critical cross-community link to pyrrole functionalization.

Conceptual Communities Identified:\n   a. Supramolecular Host Community: Includes supramolecular_host, macrocyclic_host, macrocyclic_host_molecule, macrocyclic_receptor, macrocyclic_compound, macrocyclic_chemistry, host-guest_chemistry, molecular_recognition.\n   b. Calixarene Community: Includes calixarene, calixarene_derivative, calixarene_host, calixarene_chemistry, calixarene_macrocycle, calixarene_molecule, calixarene_receptor, calixarene_compound.\n   c. Pyrrole Community: Includes pyrrole, pyrrole_moiety.\n\n2. Information Coverage by Community:\n\nA. Supramolecular Host Community:\n- Extensive details on the properties, roles, and applications of supramolecular hosts and macrocyclic hosts, including their ability to participate in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and their functionalization potential.\n- Macrocyclic hosts are described as easily functionalizable, with subtypes including calixarene, and are involved in molecular recognition and host-guest chemistry.\n- No explicit mention of pyrrole functionalization within the macrocyclic or supramolecular host classes, but the framework for functionalization is present.\n\nB. Calixarene Community:\n- Calixarenes are well described as macrocyclic, supramolecular hosts with high derivatization capability ("almost unlimited").\n- Calixarene derivatives are described, with examples of functional groups (hydrophilic, methoxy, cyano, carbamoyl, phenyl) and positions (upper/lower rim), but no explicit mention of pyrrole or pyrrole moiety as a substituent.\n- Calixarene hosts and receptors are covered, with their host-guest properties and applications, but again, no direct evidence of pyrrole-functionalized calixarenes.\n\nC. Pyrrole Community:\n- Pyrrole and pyrrole moiety are included as entities, but there is no information provided about their incorporation into calixarene derivatives or supramolecular hosts in the current results.\n\n3. Cross-Community Relationships and Gaps:\n- There is a strong structural and functional link between the supramolecular host and calixarene communities: calixarenes are a major class of macrocyclic/supramolecular hosts, and their derivatives are widely used in host-guest chemistry.\n- The calixarene community is described as highly modifiable, suggesting the possibility of pyrrole functionalization, but there is no explicit evidence or example of calixarene derivatives featuring pyrrole groups.\n- The pyrrole community is not directly connected to calixarene derivatives or supramolecular hosts in the current data.\n\n4. Missing Communities or Information:\n- The key missing link is explicit evidence or examples of calixarene derivatives that feature pyrrole (or pyrrole moiety) as a functional group. While the data shows that calixarenes can be derivatized with many groups, and that macrocyclic hosts can be functionalized, there is no direct mention of pyrrole-functionalized calixarenes.\n- No references or property restrictions directly connect pyrrole or pyrrole moiety to calixarene derivatives or supramolecular hosts.\n\n5. Satisfactoriness of the Answer:\n- The user can learn that calixarenes are highly derivatizable supramolecular hosts and that macrocyclic hosts can be functionalized with a wide range of groups. However, the user cannot confirm from the current data whether pyrrole-functionalized calixarene derivatives are known or have been reported.\n- The answer is therefore incomplete for the specific query intent: the existence of calixarene-based supramolecular hosts featuring pyrrole groups is not confirmed or exemplified.\n\nConclusion: The current information provides a strong conceptual framework and shows that such derivatives are plausible, but does not fulfill the user\'s request for known examples or explicit confirmation of calixarene derivatives with pyrrole functional groups.', requirements_fulfilled=False), 'timestamp': '2025-08-22T12:30:00.819175', 'messages': [SystemMessage(content='Generated hypothetical document to aid in query understanding: The query is asking whether there are known supramolecular host molecules that are based on calixare...', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5354dec3-1a77-4a54-9d25-d809b6ea7515'), SystemMessage(content='Query normalized: Are there known supramolecular hosts that are derivatives of calixarenes and also feature pyrrole functional groups?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='4989cce5-9c27-4824-9eb0-e39fa1d9c71f'), SystemMessage(content='Entity refinement not needed', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='da2b832d-773d-41db-bce1-539d2c237d2c'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='c4952194-f3a6-4056-b6ed-4c54fd4cba3e'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='df262871-6d77-4ae0-be2f-1f79bb3b8552'), SystemMessage(content='Results validation warning: Single tool evaluation with community guidance', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='8f787b2f-d13a-4b14-b50a-82e030554cc2'), SystemMessage(content='Refiner decision: retry - Generated 1 actionable hints for 1 tool calls (retry #1)', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='703fe838-d48a-4156-a592-84b6f413d120'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='61b55d51-99d2-40be-842d-b96e4671b0c3'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='231130f9-0704-401b-b613-c637f6a3bd97'), SystemMessage(content='Results validation warning: Community-guided evaluation: 1 sequential + 2 parallel', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='db64937a-174c-446a-9453-c58d600f7efb'), SystemMessage(content='Refiner decision: retry - Generated 2 actionable hints for 3 tool calls (retry #2)', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='d47a8843-2ba7-4bb4-80bd-ff246e2745f4'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='425c2007-aa6b-4a5a-b935-5ae57e4c6bed'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='8583dc18-4345-4c83-88c1-986da35f3cdc'), SystemMessage(content='Results validation warning: Community-guided evaluation: 1 sequential + 1 parallel', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='11dbcc42-e37d-4ce7-b768-79f8d6a7fd1a'), SystemMessage(content='Refiner decision: retry - Generated 2 actionable hints for 2 tool calls (retry #3)', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='64f2878e-6b59-4f6c-85a5-4799b87e3421'), SystemMessage(content='Query normalized: Are there known supramolecular hosts that are derivatives of calixarenes and also feature pyrrole functional groups?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5705cac1-076e-44dc-92a5-e3a7934a586b'), SystemMessage(content='Entity refinement not needed', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5278f80e-a609-4188-ab25-d2f495f3d9e2'), SystemMessage(content='Query strategy determined: tool_sequence', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5cef40dc-1c7d-4f2e-a507-bf9ada4adfc1'), SystemMessage(content='Tool-based query executed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='aa0e9aca-ab6e-4010-ba94-a518c8c40aa9')]}]
