{'summary': 'An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular analytical technique in which an indicator dye, initially bound to a host molecule (receptor), is displaced by an analyte (guest), resulting in a measurable signal—commonly optical—enabling detection and quantification of the analyte.', 'key_points': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a sensing method where a dye (indicator) is displaced from a host molecule by an analyte, producing a measurable signal (e.g., fluorescence or absorbance change).', 'The host molecule (receptor) forms a complex with an indicator dye; upon introduction of a guest (analyte), the dye is competitively displaced due to higher affinity of the host for the analyte.', 'IDA is widely used for the detection of post-translational modifications in proteins, such as trimethylated lysine (10.1039/C7NR02491F), and for the ultrasensitive and specific detection of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in aqueous media.', 'Indicator dyes used in IDA include lucigenin and dye_28 (10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Recognition elements in IDA can include deep cavitands, carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6), and safranine T (ST).', 'IDA can be performed in lipid membrane constructs and living cells, and is compatible with live-cell applications.', 'The interaction type in IDA is non-covalent, relying on supramolecular host–guest chemistry.', 'IDA is selective for specific analytes, such as caffeine, and can be applied for caffeine sensing.', 'IDA is compatible with differential sensing strategies, allowing construction of sensor arrays by combining multiple receptors and indicators.', 'IDA can be coupled with optical sensors for signal output, and is applicable to the detection of analytes, metal cations, anions, drugs, and biological molecules.'], 'background_information': ['IDA is a subclass of pattern-based sensing and reporting element strategies, and is rooted in supramolecular analytical chemistry.', 'The method is highly compatible with differential sensing, enabling the construction of sensor arrays for complex sample analysis (10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'IDA can utilize synthetic receptors, such as deep cavitands and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), as host molecules.', 'Components used in IDA systems may include poly(N-acetylaniline) and graphene, in addition to traditional host–guest pairs.', 'IDA is a non-covalent molecular recognition strategy, making it suitable for reversible and dynamic sensing applications.', 'Fluorescent Indicator Displacement Assay (F-IDA) is a specialized subclass of IDA focused on fluorescence-based detection.', 'IDA is used in supramolecular analytical chemistry for quantification and optical sensing of targets such as tcc_cavitand, choline, butyrylcholine, choline analogs, and betaine.', 'IDA is performed in both aqueous media and inside live cells, and can be used to monitor biological phenomena such as hypoxia.'], 'relationships': ['IDA involves a competitive binding equilibrium between the host (receptor), indicator dye, and analyte (guest), where the analyte displaces the indicator due to higher binding affinity.', 'IDA is a technique of supramolecular analytical chemistry and is a type of pattern-based sensing method.', 'IDA is used in differential sensing, where arrays of multiple receptors and indicators provide enhanced selectivity and sensitivity.', 'IDA systems can be constructed using various host–guest pairs, including deep cavitands, carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6), safranine T (ST), beta-cyclodextrin, poly(N-acetylaniline), and graphene.', 'IDA is applied for the detection of a wide range of analytes, including biological molecules (e.g., trimethylated lysine), drugs (e.g., caffeine), metal cations, and anions.', 'IDA is performed in diverse environments, including lipid membrane constructs, living cells, and aqueous media, and can be used for both in vitro and in vivo sensing applications.', 'IDA is coupled with optical sensors for signal transduction, enabling quantitative and qualitative analysis of analytes.']}
