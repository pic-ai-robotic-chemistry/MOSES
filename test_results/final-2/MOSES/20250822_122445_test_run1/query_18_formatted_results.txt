{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind anions via anion-π interactions are macrocyclic arenes, especially 2,6-helic[6]arene and its derivatives, as well as certain cyclophanes and related macrocycles with electron-deficient aromatic surfaces.', 'key_points': ['Macrocyclic arenes such as 2,6-helic[6]arene, 2,6-helic[6]arene derivatives, and 2,6-helix[6]arene are prominent supramolecular hosts that bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions.', 'Cyclophane derivatives, including those with electron-deficient aromatic rings, are also established as anion-π binding hosts.', 'Calixarenes (e.g., calix[4]arene, calix[6]arene, calix[8]arene) and their derivatives can participate in anion-π interactions, particularly when functionalized to enhance π-acidity.', 'Foldamers such as iodotriazole foldamers are structurally capable of anion-π recognition, though their primary mode may involve other noncovalent interactions.', 'No molecular tweezers were identified in the ontology results as primary anion-π hosts, indicating their lesser relevance in this context.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are noncovalent interactions between an anion and the π-system of an electron-deficient aromatic ring, typically requiring hosts with highly π-acidic surfaces.', 'Macrocycles, especially those with extended π-systems and electron-withdrawing substituents, are designed to maximize anion-π binding affinity and selectivity.', 'Calixarenes and cyclophanes can be chemically modified (e.g., sulfonation, introduction of electron-withdrawing groups) to enhance their π-acidity and thus their ability to engage in anion-π interactions.', 'The ontology lists a wide array of macrocyclic and cyclophane-based hosts, but only those with appropriate π-acidic character are relevant for anion-π binding.', 'Foldamers, while structurally diverse, may incorporate π-acidic units for anion recognition, but are less commonly the primary class for anion-π binding compared to macrocyclic arenes and cyclophanes.'], 'relationships': ['2,6-helic[6]arene and its derivatives are both macrocycles and cyclophanes, representing a structural archetype for anion-π hosts.', 'Calixarenes, while a broad class, only function as anion-π hosts when appropriately functionalized to increase π-acidity.', 'Cyclophane derivatives overlap with macrocyclic arenes in their ability to present π-acidic surfaces for anion binding.', 'Foldamers and molecular tweezers are structurally related to macrocycles but are less frequently the primary hosts for anion-π interactions, as indicated by the ontology results.']}
