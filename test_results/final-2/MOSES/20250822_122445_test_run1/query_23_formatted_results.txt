{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) using optical detection can be designed based on a range of host-guest interactions, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, π-π stacking, and metal coordination, each contributing distinct recognition and selectivity profiles within supramolecular systems.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, π-π stacking, and metal coordination are all established host-guest interaction types suitable for IDA design with optical detection.', 'Hydrogen bonding is mediated by functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, and pyridine dicarboxamide, and is significant in molecular recognition, anion binding, protein denaturation, and Hofmeister effects (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259). Hydrogen bond distance is typically 2.1 Å, with an average bond energy of 23.8 kJ/mol (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000739).', 'Electrostatic interactions are non-covalent forces between charged species (e.g., lysine residue and sulfonate group, methylated lysine and calixarene hosts) and are a primary driving force for guest location and selectivity in host-guest complexes (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201605394). These interactions are extremely sensitive to the environment and can be overwhelmed by high-energy water release (DOI: 10.1039/D0QO00649A; 10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004).', 'Hydrophobic interactions occur between nonpolar moieties (e.g., alkyl chains, aromatic guests) and are influenced by factors such as chain extension, Hofmeister salt ions, and the presence of cavities. Both water-mediated and non-water-mediated hydrophobic effects are relevant (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'π-π stacking, while not detailed in the provided data, is recognized as a key noncovalent interaction in supramolecular host-guest chemistry and can contribute to optical signal changes in IDAs.', 'Metal coordination is applied in systems such as cavitands, providing specific and strong binding sites for guest molecules (DOI: 10.1021/acs.joc.1c00794).', 'Molecular recognition in IDAs is governed by weak interactions, including electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic effect, and ion-dipole interactions, and is influenced by factors such as cavity size and rigid cone conformation (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are supramolecular analytical methods where a host-guest complex with an optical indicator is displaced by an analyte, resulting in a measurable optical signal change.', 'IDAs have been applied for the detection of analytes such as trimethylated lysine and caffeine, using recognition elements like deep cavitands and macrocyclic hosts (e.g., carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6), safranine T (ST), lucigenin, dye_28).', 'Hydrogen bonding is among the strongest and most influential intermolecular forces but is weakened in water and can be hard to deploy under biological conditions. It plays a significant role in molecular recognition and is present in both organic media and aqueous environments.', 'Electrostatic interactions are evaluated by DFT calculations and can occur at specific structural features such as carbonyl portals. They are subject to entropic cancellation with solute-solvent and solvent reorganization entropy (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Hydrophobic interactions are involved in the formation of host-guest complexes within cavities and are affected by environmental factors such as pH and the presence of Hofmeister ions.', 'Molecular recognition efficiency in IDAs can reach up to 55%, with tight binding and improved detection sensitivity achieved by covalent linking of cyclodextrins to fluorescent probes.', 'Supramolecular chemistry, as the overarching field, focuses on noncovalent interactions and the study of host-guest molecular recognition systems, with applications in biological conditions and real-world sensing (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).'], 'relationships': ['Hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions often act cooperatively in host-guest recognition, with selectivity and binding strength modulated by the interplay of these forces.', 'Electrostatic interactions are particularly important for the recognition of charged analytes (e.g., methylated lysine, sulfate) and are often complemented by hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking in complex supramolecular assemblies.', 'Hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions can be concerted, especially in water-soluble architectures, to stabilize host-guest complexes involving aromatic and dianionic guests.', 'The selectivity of IDAs can be tuned by the choice of host structure (e.g., macrocyclic receptors, cavitands) and the nature of the noncovalent interactions employed.', 'Molecular recognition in IDAs is a specialization of supramolecular chemistry, which itself is a subfield of chemical science focused on the design and study of noncovalent host-guest systems.']}
