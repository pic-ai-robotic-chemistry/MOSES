{'summary': 'Host molecules that utilize host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays are primarily macrocyclic hosts, including cyclodextrins (notably β-cyclodextrin), calixarenes (such as p-sulfonatocalix(4)arene), and cucurbiturils (notably cucurbit[7]uril and cucurbit[8]uril). These hosts form selective, non-covalent complexes with guest molecules, enabling sensitive and selective electrochemical detection.', 'key_points': ['Macrocyclic host molecules used in host-guest recognition for electrochemical assays include: cyclodextrins (α-, β-, γ-cyclodextrin and derivatives), calixarenes (calix[4]arene, p-sulfonatocalix(4)arene, sulfonatocalix(n)arene), cucurbiturils (cucurbit[6]uril, cucurbit[7]uril, cucurbit[8]uril), and pillararenes (e.g., pillar[5]arene).', 'β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is specifically identified as a host for methylene blue (MB) and quinine in electrochemical host-guest recognition assays.', 'Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) are used as hosts for amino acids, peptides, and dyes (e.g., 7-DCCAE), forming 1:1 or 1:2 host-guest complexes with high binding constants (e.g., 10^6 M^-1 for 7-DCCAE–CB[8]).', 'Calixarenes, especially p-sulfonatocalix(4)arene (SCX4), are used as water-soluble hosts for cationic and aromatic guests, including viologen and dyes, in electrochemical sensing platforms.', 'Host-guest recognition is integrated with electrochemical sensors and assays, enabling the detection of analytes such as quinine and tryptophan via indicator displacement assays (IDA) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).', 'Host-guest complexes are characterized by non-covalent interactions (hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, cation-π, ion-dipole), and their formation is confirmed by techniques such as 1H NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.', 'Electrochemical sensors based on host-guest recognition exhibit high selectivity, reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven electrodes), stability (86.47% DPV signal retention over 21 days), and reusability (multiple cycles after regeneration).'], 'background_information': ["Cyclodextrins are classical water-soluble macrocyclic hosts with high affinity for hydrophobic amino acids (e.g., phenylalanine) and are frequently used in supramolecular chemistry and electrochemical sensing. Their binding is primarily driven by hydrophobic effects, with some hydrogen bonding at the macrocycle's outer shell.", 'Cucurbiturils are synthetic macrocyclic hosts with high binding affinity and selectivity for methylated lysines, amino acids, peptides, and various organic guests. They are used in molecular recognition, drug delivery, and catalysis, and are characterized by their hydrophobic interior and ability to form strong host-guest complexes in aqueous media.', 'Calixarenes, especially sulfonated derivatives, are macrocyclic hosts with adjustable cavity size and high water solubility. They are particularly useful for binding cationic and aromatic guests, and their derivatization capability is almost unlimited, allowing for tailored selectivity and sensor applications.', 'Host-guest systems in electrochemical assays often employ indicator displacement assays (IDA), where a competitive guest displaces an indicator from the host, resulting in a measurable electrochemical signal. These systems are typically monitored by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).', 'Host-guest complexes can be formed in various stoichiometries (1:1, 1:2, 2:1), with binding constants ranging from 10^4 to 10^6 M^-1, and are stabilized by hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding interactions. The stability and selectivity of these complexes can be modulated by pH, ionic strength, and the presence of co-binders (e.g., methyl viologen).', 'Electrochemical sensing platforms based on host-guest recognition are composed of components such as β-cyclodextrin, glassy carbon electrodes, poly(N-acetylaniline), and reduced graphene oxide, providing high selectivity and minimal interference from common ions and biomolecules (e.g., KCl, MgCl2, SDS, ascorbic acid, glucose, BSA).', 'Host-guest recognition is a type of molecular recognition, governed by weak non-covalent interactions, and is a specialization of supramolecular chemistry.
