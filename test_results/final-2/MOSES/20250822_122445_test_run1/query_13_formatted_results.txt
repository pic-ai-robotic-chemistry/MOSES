{'summary': "Molecules that typically act as guests for supramolecular hosts include a wide range of small organic and inorganic molecules, ions, peptides, and biomolecules, which can be cationic, anionic, or neutral, and are selected based on size, shape, charge, and chemical complementarity to the host's cavity.", 'key_points': ['Guest molecules encompass cationic guests (e.g., acetyl choline, acetyl thiocholine), anionic guests (e.g., TNS, 2,6-ANS, 1,8-ANS, X-(H2O)), neutral guests, neutral organic molecules, peptides, amino acids, oligopeptides, aromatic compounds, alkanes, alcohols, and various small organic and inorganic species.', 'Cationic guests are positively charged molecules, often with n-substituted alkyl chains, that interact with macrocyclic hosts such as Q(8) (DOI: 10.1039/D0QO00649A).', 'Anionic guests include molecules such as TNS, 2,6-ANS, 1,8-ANS, and X-(H2O), which can be solvated at both portals when bound to cyclodextrins (CDs) but not when bound to cavitands (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Neutral organic molecules are also common guests, serving as potential targets for inclusion complexes.', 'Specific examples of guest molecules include: 1,4-ditert-butylbenzene, 4,4-dimethylbiphenyl, acetylcholine, adenine derivatives, alanine hydrochloride, amphiphilic guests, anthracene, betaine, choline, cyclodipeptides, cyclohexane, dicyanamide, dimethylbiphenyl, glycine-containing peptides, l-lysine, l-tryptophan, l-tyrosine, methylamine, n-alkanes, naphthalene, palmatine, phenylalanine, proline hydrochloride, pyrene, quaternary ammonium guests, sodium salts, threonine hydrochloride, toluene, trimethyllysine, tripeptides, and water molecules.', 'Guest molecules can be classified by charge: cationic guests, anionic guests, and neutral guests, as well as by chemical nature: organic guests, inorganic guests, peptide guests, and aromatic guest molecules.', 'Guest molecules often possess structural features such as n-substituted alkyl chains, aromatic moieties, hydrophilic or hydrophobic side groups, and functional groups (e.g., imidazole).', 'Guest molecules may be amphiphilic, chromophoric, biocompatible, or possess specific photophysical properties (e.g., aggregation-induced emission generators, fluorescent dyes).', 'Guest molecules are included in the cavity of supramolecular hosts such as macrocycles, cavitands, cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8), cyclodextrins, and resorcinarene-based hosts, forming host-guest complexes with defined stoichiometry (often 1:1).', 'The selection of guest molecules is governed by size and shape complementarity, charge compatibility, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, and the ability to form non-covalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, ion-dipole interactions).'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts are synthetic molecules designed to bind specific guest molecules with high affinity and selectivity, often targeting natural or biologically relevant molecules such as amino acids, peptides, proteins, and post-translationally modified residues (e.g., methylated lysine).', 'Host-guest chemistry relies on non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, π-π interactions, and electrostatic interactions, to achieve molecular recognition and selective binding.', 'The binding affinity and selectivity of supramolecular hosts are influenced by the degree of structural complementarity, the presence of appended groups (e.g., methyl, butyl, tert-butyl, isopropyl), and the physicochemical properties of the guest (e.g., water solubility, hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity).', 'Guest molecules can facilitate the formation of higher-order assemblies such as nanoparticles, vesicles, supramolecular micelles, and stimuli-responsive nanostructures.', 'The inclusion of guest molecules in host cavities can displace high-energy water molecules, induce conformational changes, and modulate the photophysical or chemical properties of the guest (e.g., fluorescence lifetime, reactivity).', 'Host-guest systems are characterized by association constants (K_a), enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (TΔS), and Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG), which are measured using techniques such as NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis absorption, and isothermal titration calorimetry.', 'Supramolecular hosts are often inspired by natural systems and are used in applications such as chemical biology, biochemistry, drug delivery, molecular sensing, and the study of molecular recognition mechanisms (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).'], 'relationships': ['Guest molecules are included in the cavity of supramolecular hosts, forming host-guest complexes with defined stoichiometry (often 1:1).', 'Cationic guests interact with macrocyclic hosts such as Q(8) via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, often involving n-substituted alkyl chains (DOI: 10.1039/D0QO00649A).', 'Anionic guests can be solvated at both portals when bound to cyclodextrins but not when bound to cavitands, indicating the influence of host structure on guest solvation (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'The selection and binding of guest molecules are governed by size and shape complementarity, charge compatibility, and the ability to form specific non-covalent interactions with the host.', 'Guest molecules can induce the formation of higher-order supramolecular assemblies and modulate the properties of the host-guest system.', 'Supramolecular hosts are designed to discriminate among closely related guest molecules, such as post-translationally methylated amino acids, based on subtle differences in structure and charge (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).']}
