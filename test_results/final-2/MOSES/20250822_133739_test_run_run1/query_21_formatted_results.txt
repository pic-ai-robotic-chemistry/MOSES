{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDA) can detect a broad spectrum of molecular targets, including metal ions, anions, small organic molecules, drugs, and biomacromolecules such as peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids, through non-covalent competitive binding events that displace a reporter indicator from a host receptor.', 'key_points': ['IDA detects analytes including metal ions (e.g., Cu(II), Fe(III)), anions (e.g., halides, oxoanions, Hofmeister series anions), small organic molecules (e.g., amino acids, drugs, neurotransmitters), and biomacromolecules (e.g., peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, post-translationally modified proteins).', 'Specific analytes detected by IDA include trimethylated lysine, caffeine, choline, butyrylcholine, betaine, and various post-translationally modified peptides and proteins.', 'IDA is capable of detecting analytes in complex environments such as aqueous solution, lipid membrane constructs, and inside live cells.', 'The technique is compatible with a wide range of host-guest systems, including synthetic receptors (e.g., deep cavitands, calixarenes, cyclodextrins, pillararenes), and can utilize various indicators (e.g., lucigenin, safranine T, dye 28).', 'IDA can be applied for the detection of both charged (metal cations, anions) and neutral species (small organic molecules, biomolecules), with selectivity and sensitivity modulated by the host structure and indicator choice.', 'Quantitative parameters such as association constants (e.g., 2.0 Ã— 10^2), binding models (e.g., 1:1 host-guest), and experimental conditions (e.g., 95% water/5% deuterium oxide, pH 1) are critical for analyte detection and are routinely reported in IDA studies.'], 'background_information': ['IDA is a supramolecular analytical chemistry technique that relies on competitive binding: an analyte displaces a pre-bound indicator from a host, resulting in a measurable optical signal (e.g., fluorescence, absorbance).', 'The method is highly adaptable, allowing for the construction of sensor arrays by combining multiple receptors and indicators, and is particularly compatible with differential sensing strategies (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Host-guest recognition elements used in IDA include deep cavitands, calixarenes, cyclodextrins, and pillararenes, which can be tailored for specific analyte classes through structural modification.', 'IDA is used for the detection of biologically and environmentally relevant targets, including post-translational modifications (e.g., methylated lysines), drugs, neurotransmitters, and environmental anions.', 'Anion detection by IDA is influenced by factors such as solvation energy, hydration shell, position in the Hofmeister series, and the nature of host-anion interactions (coulombic, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals).', 'Metal ion detection is modulated by the first coordination sphere, Lewis acidity, and competition with solvent molecules (DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02541).', 'IDA can be performed in various environments, including aqueous solution, lipid environments, and live cells, and is compatible with optical sensor outputs.', 'The technique is non-covalent and reversible, allowing for real-time and repeatable measurements.'], 'relationships': ['IDA detects analytes via competitive binding, where the analyte displaces an indicator from a host receptor, leading to a change in optical signal.', "The selectivity and sensitivity of IDA are determined by the interplay between the host structure, the indicator, and the analyte's chemical properties (e.g., charge, size, hydrophobicity, post-translational modifications).", "Anion detection is closely related to the anion's solvation properties, hydration state, and position in the Hofmeister series, which affect binding affinity and signal response (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).", "Metal ion detection is influenced by the host's ability to coordinate metal ions, the nature of the first coordination sphere, and competition with solvent (DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02541).", 'IDA is frequently coupled with differential sensing and pattern-based sensing strategies to enhance analyte discrimination and multiplexed detection capabilities.', 'Host-guest chemistry underpins the molecular recognition events in IDA, with synthetic receptors providing tunable selectivity for diverse analyte classes.']}
