{'summary': 'The principal types of supramolecular hosts that bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions are aromatic macrocycles, specifically calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils. These hosts utilize electron-rich aromatic cavities to engage in selective, high-affinity binding of cationic guests via cation-π interactions.', 'key_points': ['Aromatic macrocycles—including calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils—are established supramolecular hosts that bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions.', 'Calixarenes possess a bowl-shaped, electron-rich aromatic cavity and are fully addressable, with almost unlimited derivatization capability, and are particularly effective for recognition of methylated lysine and other cationic guests via cation-π interactions (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cyclophanes, as cyclic forms of phenylalkanes, act as synthetic container molecules with high binding affinity for alkylammonium ions and acetylcholine, utilizing cation-π interactions within their aromatic cavities (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Pillararenes feature electron-rich cavities and demonstrate cation-π interactions with amine groups, showing high affinity and selectivity for methylated lysine and other cationic analytes (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cucurbiturils, with hydrophobic interiors and high binding affinity, are synthetic container molecules that recognize methylated lysine and amino acids, engaging cationic guests through cation-π and ion-dipole interactions (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'The cation-π interaction is a key non-covalent force in these host-guest systems, enabling selective recognition and high-affinity binding of cationic species such as methylated amino acids, peptides, and neurotransmitters.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts are designed to mimic natural protein recognition sites, using weak interactions such as cation-π, π-π, and hydrogen bonding to achieve selectivity for biological targets (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', "Aromatic macrocycles are structural analogues of the 'aromatic cage' found in protein reader domains, providing a biomimetic platform for selective recognition of post-translationally methylated partners (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).", 'Calixarenes are synthesized via condensation of formaldehyde with p-alkylphenols under basic conditions, are fully addressable, and can be easily modified at the upper or lower rim to tune selectivity and affinity (DOI: 10.1021/jo502825z).', 'Cyclophanes and their derivatives, including water-soluble forms, are involved in host-guest chemistry and are comparable to biological recognition sites, with dissociation constants as low as 50 μM for certain guests (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Pillararenes, though often poorly soluble, possess electron-rich cavities that facilitate cation-π interactions, and are used for recognition of methylated lysine and selective binding of l-asparagine (DOI: 10.1016/j.tetlet.2017.05.095).', 'Cucurbiturils exhibit high binding affinity for cationic guests, are used in catalysis and molecular recognition, and are the basis for artificial light harvesting systems (DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'Host-guest complexes formed by these macrocycles are highly selective for methylation state, enabling discrimination between methylated and unmethylated amino acids and peptides, and can out-compete native reader proteins in binding affinity (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).'], 'relationships': ['Aromatic macrocycles (calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, cucurbiturils) are structurally and functionally related as supramolecular hosts that utilize cation-π interactions for guest binding.', 'Calixarenes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils all share the ability to recognize methylated lysine, highlighting a convergent functional role in biomolecular recognition (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cyclophanes are a typical example of aromatic macrocycles and are structurally analogous to the aromatic cage in protein domains, reinforcing the biomimetic aspect of these hosts (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'The selectivity and affinity of these hosts for cationic guests are tunable via derivatization and structural modification, allowing for tailored recognition properties in chemical biology and sensor applications.', 'Cation-π interactions are a unifying non-covalent force across these host classes, enabling selective sequestration and discrimination of biologically relevant cationic species, including post-translationally methylated amino acids and neurotransmitters.']}
