{'summary': 'The principal types of supramolecular hosts known to bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions are electron-deficient aromatic macrocycles, notably triazine-based hosts (including heterocalix[2]arene[2]triazine) and certain calixarene derivatives with electron-deficient π-surfaces. These hosts exploit the anion-π interaction as a primary non-covalent binding mode for anion recognition and encapsulation.', 'key_points': ['Triazine-based hosts, especially those containing the electron-deficient triazine ring, exhibit anion-π interaction capability (DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663). The triazine ring is electron-deficient and located within a hydrophobic cavity, enabling strong anion-π interactions with anionic guests.', 'Heterocalix[2]arene[2]triazine is a subtype of triazine-based host specifically designed for anion recognition via anion-π interactions (DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663).', 'Calixarene derivatives, particularly those with upper or lower rim modifications introducing electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano, carbamoyl, phenyl), can create electron-deficient π-surfaces that facilitate anion-π interactions. Water-soluble calixarene derivatives with hydrophilic or charged groups also enhance anion binding in aqueous media (DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663, DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Difluorobenzene and its regioisomers (o-, m-, p-difluorobenzene) are electron-deficient aromatic systems that can serve as π-surfaces for anion-π interactions, and are used as model systems or components in supramolecular host design (DOI:10.1021/acs.joc.1c00794).', 'The anion-π interaction is a non-covalent interaction that occurs between an anion and an electron-deficient aromatic π-system, and is a recognized driving force for anion binding in supramolecular chemistry (DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663).'], 'background_information': ['Triazine-based hosts are synthesized from cyanuric chloride, diamine, and diol, and possess hydrophobic characteristics and broad guest molecule binding range. Their anion sensing capability is demonstrated for fluoride and chloride ions (DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663).', "The triazine ring's electron deficiency (average C–N bond distance: 1.38 Å) and its location in a hydrophobic cavity are critical for anion-π interaction capability. Post-modification (e.g., metal-catalyzed cross-coupling) can further tune the electronic properties of the triazine ring (DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663).", 'Calixarene derivatives are fully addressable synthetic macrocycles, easily synthesized by condensation of formaldehyde with p-alkylphenols under basic conditions. Their derivatization capability is almost unlimited, allowing for the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents to modulate π-acidity and anion affinity (DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Water-soluble calixarene derivatives are obtained by introducing hydrophilic groups at the upper or lower rim, improving compatibility and reducing cytotoxicity compared to natural calixarenes. These modifications also enhance anion binding in aqueous solution (DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663).', 'Difluorobenzene regioisomers are used as model π-systems for studying anion-π interactions. Their binding stability order for anion complexes is o-difluorobenzene (highest), p-difluorobenzene (intermediate), m-difluorobenzene (lowest), with quantitative recovery yields in extraction experiments (DOI:10.1021/acs.joc.1c00794).', 'Anion-π interactions are a subclass of non-covalent interactions, distinct from hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, and π–π interactions, and are particularly important in the design of precision supramolecular anion receptors (DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663).'], 'relationships': ['Triazine-based hosts and calixarene derivatives both utilize electron-deficient aromatic π-systems to enable anion-π interactions as the primary mode of anion binding.', 'The electron deficiency of the π-system (e.g., triazine ring, difluorobenzene) is essential for effective anion-π interaction, and can be tuned by chemical modification (e.g., introduction of cyano, carbamoyl, or phenyl substituents).', 'Water solubility and hydrophilic group introduction in calixarene derivatives enhance their practical application for anion binding in aqueous environments, which is otherwise rare for anion receptors (DOI:10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Difluorobenzene and its regioisomers serve as both model systems for fundamental studies and as building blocks in the design of larger supramolecular hosts with anion-π binding capability.', 'Anion-π interactions are a key driving force in supramolecular engineering, enabling selective and reversible anion recognition in both organic and aqueous media.']}
