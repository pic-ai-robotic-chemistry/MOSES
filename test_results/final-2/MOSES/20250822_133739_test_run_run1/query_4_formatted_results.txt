{'summary': 'An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is composed of a synthetic receptor, an indicator, and an analyte, typically operating via non-covalent interactions in an appropriate solvent or buffer system. The assay may also include specific components such as beta-cyclodextrin, graphene, or poly(N-acetylaniline), and is often coupled with optical sensor output for detection.', 'key_points': ['Essential components of an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) include: indicator, synthetic receptor, and analyte.', 'The indicator is a molecular species whose signal (often optical) changes upon displacement from the receptor by the analyte.', 'The synthetic receptor is designed to bind both the indicator and the analyte, with higher affinity for the analyte, enabling displacement.', 'The analyte can be a metal cation, anion, drug, or biological molecule, serving as the sensing target.', 'IDA operates via non-covalent interactions between the receptor, indicator, and analyte.', 'The assay is typically performed in aqueous media, and can be conducted inside live cells.', 'Specific assay components may include beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), graphene, or poly(N-acetylaniline) as part of the receptor or sensor matrix.', 'Sensor output is commonly optical (optical sensor), enabling ultrasensitive detection.', 'IDA possesses sensor conversion capability (sensor_conversion_capability: yes).'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is classified under molecular recognition, sensing strategy, and supramolecular chemistry.', 'IDA can be coupled with differential sensing strategies to enhance selectivity and sensitivity (see DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'A notable application is the ultrasensitive fluorescence detection of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in aqueous media.', 'The IDA platform can be adapted for monitoring specific biological targets, such as hypoxia, and is compatible with live-cell environments.', 'A subclass of IDA is the fluorescent indicator displacement assay (F-IDA), which specifically utilizes fluorescence as the signaling modality.'], 'relationships': ['The indicator binds to the synthetic receptor, and is displaced upon introduction of the analyte, resulting in a measurable signal change.', 'The synthetic receptor must have differential binding affinities for the indicator and the analyte, favoring analyte binding for effective displacement.', 'Non-covalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, π-π stacking) govern the association and displacement processes.', 'The presence of specific components such as beta-cyclodextrin, graphene, or poly(N-acetylaniline) can modulate receptor properties and sensor performance.', 'IDA is often integrated with optical sensors to transduce the displacement event into a quantifiable output.', 'IDA can be performed in live-cell environments, enabling real-time biological monitoring.']}
