{'summary': 'In an electrochemical sensor using an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA), quinine displaces methylene blue (MB) from the β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) host via competitive host-guest binding, due to its higher affinity for β-CD, resulting in a measurable electrochemical signal change.', 'key_points': ['Quinine acts as the target analyte and methylene blue (MB) serves as the probe in the IDA-based electrochemical sensor.', 'MB forms a 1:1 inclusion complex with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) via host-guest interaction, with MB located inside the β-CD cavity.', 'Upon introduction, quinine competitively binds to β-CD, displacing MB from the β-CD/MB complex due to its higher binding affinity for β-CD.', 'The displacement of MB by quinine is mediated by host-guest chemistry and competitive binding, resulting in the release of MB from the β-CD cavity.', 'The process is characterized by a measurable change in the electrochemical signal (peak current at 0.24 V for MB), which decreases as MB is displaced by quinine.', 'Quantitative parameters: MB concentration is typically 10 µM (surface density: 1.18 × 10^15 molecules/cm^2), quinine is used at a 1:1 molar ratio with β-CD, and the incubation time for displacement is 40 min.', 'The mechanism is confirmed by techniques such as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR), which show a slight proton peak shift upon complexation and displacement.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is an analytical technique where a host molecule (β-CD) binds an indicator dye (MB), and the displacement of the dye by a guest molecule (quinine) is used to detect the presence of the guest via a measurable signal.', 'Host-guest chemistry underpins the mechanism, with β-CD acting as the host and both MB and quinine as guests; the process occurs in aqueous solution and is investigated by methods such as H NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', 'Electrochemical sensors constructed by IDA exhibit properties such as good reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven electrodes), high stability (86.47% of original DPV signal retained up to 21 days at 4°C), and superior selectivity over common interfering molecules.', 'MB is enriched on β-CD/poly(n-acetylaniline) nanointerconnected network/reduced graphene oxide/glassy carbon electrodes, and its adsorption can be restrained by poly(n-acetylaniline) film.', 'The IDA approach is also applied for the detection of other analytes (e.g., tryptophan, caffeine, trimethylated lysine) and can use other indicator dyes (e.g., lucigenin, safranine T).'], 'relationships': ['MB is initially located in the β-CD cavity via host-guest recognition; quinine competitively binds to β-CD, displacing MB through competitive binding.', 'The displacement of MB by quinine is mediated by host-guest interaction, resulting in a decrease in the electrochemical signal associated with MB.', 'Both MB and quinine form 1:1 inclusion complexes with β-CD, but quinine has a higher affinity, enabling it to displace MB.', "The electrochemical sensor's detection of quinine is based on the measurable change in MB's signal upon displacement, verified by DPV, CV, and H NMR.", 'Competitive binding is the underlying mechanism, where the guest with higher affinity (quinine) replaces the indicator (MB) in the host (β-CD).']}
