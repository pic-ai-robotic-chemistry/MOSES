{'summary': 'An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular analytical technique in which an indicator dye, initially bound to a host (receptor), is competitively displaced by an analyte, resulting in a measurable optical signal change that enables sensitive and selective analyte detection.', 'key_points': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a sensing method where a dye (indicator) is displaced from a host molecule (receptor) by an analyte, producing a measurable signal, typically optical (e.g., fluorescence or absorbance).', 'The mechanism relies on competitive binding: the indicator forms a complex with the receptor, and upon introduction of the analyte (guest), the analyte outcompetes the indicator for binding to the receptor, displacing the indicator and altering the optical signal.', 'IDA is characterized by non-covalent interactions between the receptor, indicator, and analyte, allowing reversible and dynamic sensing.', 'IDA can be performed in various environments, including lipid membrane constructs and living cells, and is compatible with aqueous media.', 'Common indicators include lucigenin and dye_28; receptors can include deep cavitands, carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene (WP6), and synthetic receptors.', 'IDA is applied for the detection of a wide range of analytes, including trimethylated lysine, caffeine, LPA (lysophosphatidic acid), metal cations, anions, drugs, and biological molecules.', 'IDA is highly compatible with differential sensing strategies, enabling the construction of sensor arrays by combining multiple receptors and indicators for pattern-based recognition.', 'IDA exhibits high selectivity and sensitivity, as demonstrated in applications such as ultrasensitive fluorescence detection of LPA and selective caffeine sensing.'], 'background_information': ['IDA is a subclass of pattern-based sensing and reporting element methodologies, and is a key technique in supramolecular analytical chemistry.', 'The technique is often coupled with differential sensing, which leverages sensor arrays for enhanced discrimination among analytes (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'IDA can utilize a variety of components, including beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), poly(N-acetylaniline), graphene, and safranine T (ST), depending on the specific sensing application.', 'The sensor output is typically optical, with changes in fluorescence or absorbance serving as the readout for analyte detection.', 'IDA is used to measure binding affinities and to detect post-translational modifications in proteins, such as trimethylated lysine (DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F).', 'The method is suitable for live-cell applications and can monitor biological phenomena such as hypoxia.', 'IDA is more compatible with differential sensing than many other techniques, facilitating the construction of multiplexed sensor arrays.'], 'relationships': ['IDA involves a ternary system: receptor (host), indicator (dye), and analyte (guest), with competitive binding as the central mechanism.', 'The displacement of the indicator by the analyte leads to a quantifiable optical signal change, which is the basis for analyte detection.', 'IDA is applied for the detection of specific targets such as trimethylated lysine (DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F) and caffeine, and is used in caffeine sensing and LPA detection.', 'Recognition elements such as deep cavitands and carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene (WP6) are used as hosts, while indicators such as lucigenin and dye_28 serve as optical reporters (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'IDA is a technique within supramolecular analytical chemistry and is used in conjunction with differential sensing for pattern-based analyte recognition (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).']}
