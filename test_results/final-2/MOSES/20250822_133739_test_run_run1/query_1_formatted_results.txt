{'summary': 'Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid with low solubility in water, primarily used as an antimalarial agent and bittering agent, and is characterized by specific analytical, physicochemical, and toxicological properties.', 'key_points': ['Quinine is classified as an alkaloid and is a component of cinchona tree bark.', 'It exhibits low solubility in water and is hydrophobic.', 'Stock solutions of quinine are typically prepared in ethanol at a concentration of 10 mM and can be diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS).', 'Quinine forms a 1:1 molar ratio complex with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD).', 'Analytical detection and quantification of quinine utilize methods such as quantitative electrochemical methods, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), electrochemiluminescence biosensors, and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).', 'Quinine is analyzed by electrochemical techniques, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), colorimetric assays, fluorescence assays, and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).', 'In NMR analysis, quinine exhibits a slight proton peak shift.', 'Recovery rates for quinine in analytical procedures range from 98.3% to 109.3%, with an incubation time of 40 minutes.', 'Quinine is used for the treatment of malaria, lupus, arthritis, and muscle cramps, and as a bittering agent in food and beverages.', 'Adverse health effects induced by quinine include thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, blindness, and acute kidney injury.'], 'background_information': ['Quinine serves as a target analyte in various detection schemes, reflecting its importance in pharmaceutical and food analysis.', 'Its hydrophobic nature and low aqueous solubility necessitate the use of organic solvents such as ethanol for stock solution preparation.', 'The 1:1 molar ratio with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is relevant for inclusion complex formation, which can affect its solubility and analytical behavior.', 'Electrochemical and chromatographic methods are preferred for sensitive and selective quantification of quinine in complex matrices.', 'The use of quinine as a bittering agent is significant in the beverage industry, notably in tonic water.', 'Toxicological concerns, including hematological and renal adverse effects, are critical in clinical and regulatory contexts.'], 'relationships': ['Quinine is detected by quantitative electrochemical methods, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), and electrochemiluminescence biosensors, and is determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).', 'It is analyzed by a range of techniques: electrochemical techniques, HPLC, colorimetric assays, fluorescence assays, and HRMS.', 'Quinine is dissolved in ethanol for stock solutions and diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for analytical applications.', 'It is a natural alkaloid derived from cinchona tree bark.', 'Quinine is used therapeutically for malaria, lupus, arthritis, and muscle cramps, and industrially as a bittering agent.', 'Adverse health effects such as thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, blindness, and acute kidney injury are directly induced by quinine exposure.']}
