{'summary': 'Non-covalent interactions, particularly hydrogen bonds and anion-π interactions, are fundamental driving forces in the formation, stability, selectivity, and function of supramolecular host-guest complexes, governing molecular recognition, self-assembly, and binding affinity through specific, directional, and tunable interactions.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonds are among the most relevant non-covalent interactions for selectivity and stabilization in host-guest complexation, maintaining capsular architectures (e.g., dimeric capsules) and stabilizing specific conformations such as the vase form and host-guest complexes (DOI: 10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004, 10.1021/ja0727058).', 'Hydrogen bonds are formed between defined donor and acceptor sites, such as pyridine NH binding

for supramolecular engineering and molecular recognition (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'Host-guest complexation is reversible, enthalpy-dominated, and often occurs in aqueous solution, with the strength and selectivity of binding modulated by the nature and arrangement of non-covalent interactions.', 'Hydrogen bonds are most relevant for selectivity, especially in aqueous environments, and are influenced by the presence of polar X-H donors, the geometry of donor-acceptor pairs, and the solvent environment.', 'Selectivity in host-guest systems is measured by NMR and fluorescence displacement assays and is influenced by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions.', 'Binding affinity is characterized by thermodynamic signatures (enthalpy and entropy contributions), is measured by ITC and fluorescence displacement models, and is affected by factors such as hydrophobicity, ionic strength, and sequence dependence.', 'Host-guest complexes are formed from a wide range of hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils, calixarenes, cyclodextrins, pillararenes) and guests (e.g., amino acids, peptides, dyes, small molecules), with complexation driven by size/shape complementarity and specific non-covalent interactions.', 'Hydrogen bonding is critical for maintaining supramolecular architectures such as dimeric capsules and for stabilizing specific conformations (e.g., vase conformation), and is validated by advanced computational and spectroscopic analyses.', 'Host-guest interactions involve desolvation of both host cavity and guest, with the enthalpic gain from non-covalent interactions often offset by entropic penalties.', 'Anion-π interactions, though not detailed in the data, are known to play a role in anion recognition and selectivity in
