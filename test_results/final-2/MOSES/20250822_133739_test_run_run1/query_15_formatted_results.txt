{'summary': 'When a calixarene containing pyrrole groups binds an anion, the primary non-covalent interactions involved are hydrogen bonding and anion–π interactions, with the macrocyclic structure of calixarene acting as a secondary contributor to binding specificity and cooperativity.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonding is a principal non-covalent interaction in anion binding by calixarene derivatives containing pyrrole groups. Pyrrole NH units serve as hydrogen bond donors to the anion.', 'Anion–π interactions may also contribute, where the electron-rich π-system of the pyrrole or aromatic units in the calixarene interacts with the anion.', 'The macrocyclic (calixarene) framework acts as a secondary contributor, providing a preorganized binding pocket that enhances the cooperativity and selectivity of non-covalent interactions.', 'Non-covalent interactions in these systems are rationally controlled to achieve precision supramolecular engineering, as referenced in the literature (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'Hydrophobic concavity of the calixarene cavity can enable or enhance anion binding by providing a suitable microenvironment for the guest anion.'], 'background_information': ['Calixarenes are macrocyclic, supramolecular hosts with a bowl-shaped hydrophobic cavity, often used in host–guest chemistry and molecular recognition.', 'Pyrrole groups, when incorporated into calixarene frameworks, introduce additional hydrogen bond donor sites, increasing the binding affinity and selectivity for anions.', 'Non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonds and anion–π interactions, are fundamental to the design and function of supramolecular assemblies and materials.', 'The cooperative effect of multiple non-covalent interactions is critical for the stability and specificity of anion binding in supramolecular systems.', 'Hydrogen bonding motifs involving pyrrole NH and anionic guests are validated by techniques such as atoms-in-molecules analysis and reduced density gradients analysis.', 'Macrocycles, such as calixarenes, are frequently employed in precision supramolecular engineering due to their ability to preorganize binding sites and facilitate cooperative non-covalent interactions.'], 'relationships': ['The macrocyclic structure of calixarene (macrocycle) is a secondary contributor to non-covalent interaction strength and selectivity in anion binding.', 'Hydrogen bonds are formed between the NH groups of pyrrole units and the bound anion, stabilizing the host–guest complex.', 'Anion–π interactions may occur between the anion and the π-system of pyrrole or aromatic units in the calixarene framework.', 'The hydrophobic cavity of calixarene provides a microenvironment that can enhance the effectiveness of non-covalent interactions with anions.', 'Non-covalent interactions in these systems are employed in precision supramolecular engineering, as documented in the literature (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).']}
