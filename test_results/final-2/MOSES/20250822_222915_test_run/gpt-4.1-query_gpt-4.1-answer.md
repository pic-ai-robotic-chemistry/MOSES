## 1. Are there electrochemical sensors using Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) to detect Quinine?

Yes, electrochemical sensors employing the Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) have been developed for the selective detection of quinine, leveraging the principles of supramolecular chemistry and host–guest interactions.

**Principle and Design:**
In these systems, a synthetic receptor—most notably calixarene derivatives—serves as the supramolecular host. Calixarenes are macrocyclic, bowl-shaped molecules with a hydrophobic cavity, which can be finely tuned through chemical derivatization to optimize selectivity and binding affinity for specific guest molecules such as quinine. The IDA format involves the non-covalent binding of a signaling indicator (often a redox-active or fluorescent molecule) to the calixarene host. Upon introduction of quinine, competitive binding occurs: quinine, having a higher affinity for the calixarene cavity, displaces the indicator. This displacement event leads to a measurable change in the electrochemical signal, which is directly correlated to the concentration of quinine.

**Electrochemical Sensing and Performance:**
Electrochemical transduction in these sensors is typically achieved via techniques such as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The displacement of the indicator by quinine alters the redox properties at the electrode interface, providing a sensitive and quantitative readout. These sensors have demonstrated high repeatability and reproducibility (e.g., relative standard deviation as low as 2.06% across multiple electrodes), excellent stability (retaining over 86% of the original signal after 21 days at 4°C), and superior selectivity against common interfering substances. The host–guest binding constants between calixarene and quinine are typically in the micromolar to nanomolar range, reflecting strong and selective molecular recognition, which underpins the sensor’s high sensitivity.

**Mechanistic and Structural Considerations:**
The effectiveness of calixarene-based IDA sensors for quinine detection arises from the complementarity between the hydrophobic, π-rich cavity of the calixarene and the aromatic, hydrophobic nature of quinine. Non-covalent interactions—such as π–π stacking, hydrophobic effects, and hydrogen bonding—govern the host–guest complexation. The modularity of calixarene synthesis (via condensation of formaldehyde and p-alkylphenols) allows for the introduction of functional groups that further enhance selectivity and binding strength.

**Advantages and Applications:**
These IDA-based electrochemical sensors offer several advantages: they are cost-effective, straightforward to fabricate, and amenable to miniaturization and multiplexing. Their high selectivity and sensitivity make them particularly suitable for pharmaceutical analysis, drug quality control, and potentially for in situ or point-of-care detection of quinine in complex matrices.

**Summary:**
In summary, the use of calixarene-based indicator displacement assays in electrochemical sensor platforms represents a robust and elegant application of supramolecular chemistry for the selective and sensitive detection of quinine. The approach exploits the tunable host–guest chemistry of calixarenes, the competitive binding mechanism of IDA, and the quantitative capabilities of modern electrochemical techniques, resulting in sensors with excellent analytical performance and practical utility.
