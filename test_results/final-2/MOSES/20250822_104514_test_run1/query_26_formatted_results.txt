{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests via cation-π interactions are calixarenes (notably calix[4]arene, calix[6]arene, and their derivatives), cucurbiturils (especially CB[7] and CB[8]), and pillarenes, with calixarenes being the most extensively characterized for this binding mode.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes (e.g., calix[4]arene, calix[6]arene, calix[8]arene, and their sulfonated derivatives such as SC4) are prototypical hosts that bind cationic guests (e.g., methylated lysine, ammonium ions) primarily through cation-π interactions involving their aromatic cavities.', 'Cucurbiturils (notably CB[7] and CB[8]) also utilize cation-π interactions, with their rigid, electron-rich portals providing strong binding to cationic species, including methylated amino acid side chains.', 'Pillararenes (e.g., pillar[5]arene, pillar[6]arene, and their cationic/anionic derivatives) possess electron-rich aromatic cavities that facilitate cation-π binding, especially for alkylammonium and methylated guests.', 'Cation-π interactions in these hosts typically occur between the cationic group of the guest (e.g., methylated lysine, ammonium, guanidinium) and the π-electron-rich aromatic panels of the host cavity.', 'Quantitative data: Calixarene hosts can exhibit binding affinities for trimethyllysine sufficient to outcompete native reader proteins (see DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost), with selectivity for methylation state and strong discrimination against unmethylated analogs.'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are non-covalent forces between a cation and the face of an aromatic ring, playing a critical role in molecular recognition, especially for methylated amino acids such as trimethyllysine and methylarginine.', 'Supramolecular hosts that exploit cation-π interactions are often designed to mimic natural methyl reader proteins, with applications in chemical biology and biochemistry for selective sequestration and detection of post-translationally modified biomolecules.', 'Calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and pillarenes are all macrocyclic hosts with electron-rich aromatic cavities, but differ in rigidity, cavity size, and solubility, affecting their guest selectivity and binding strength.', 'The selectivity of these hosts for methylated over unmethylated guests is a result of the enhanced cation-π interaction with the more electron-rich, methylated cationic side chains.', 'These hosts function effectively in physiologically relevant media (e.g., warm, salty water), and their interaction surfaces are smaller than those of proteins, enabling high selectivity for specific post-translational modifications.'], 'relationships': ['Cation-π interactions in supramolecular hosts occur between the aromatic panels of the host cavity and cationic groups on the guest, such as methylated lysine or ammonium ions (DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost, DOI:10.1021/jacs.6b04372).', 'Calixarene hosts (e.g., calixarene_6, calixarene_12, calixarene_1) are specifically noted to form cation-π complexes with methylated lysine and related cationic guests (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cation-π binding is a key determinant of selectivity for methylation state, enabling discrimination between methylated and unmethylated amino acids and peptides.', 'These hosts are compared to natural reader proteins in terms of selectivity and binding affinity, and can function as sequestration agents or pan-specific reagents in biological systems.', 'Cation-π interactions are evaluated and characterized by the presence of aromatic panels in the host and the nature of the cationic guest, with guanidinium and ammonium groups being particularly favored.']}
