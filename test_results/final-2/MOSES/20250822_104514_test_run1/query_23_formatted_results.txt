{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) using optical detection can be designed with a variety of host-guest interactions, including electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effects, π-π stacking, and metal coordination, each contributing distinct selectivity and sensitivity profiles.', 'key_points': ['Electrostatic interactions are a primary type of non-covalent host-guest interaction used in IDA design, especially between charged hosts (e.g., calixarenes, cucurbiturils) and charged or polar guests (e.g., amino acids, dyes, anions such as sulfate).', 'Electrostatic interactions are extremely sensitive to environmental conditions (e.g., solvent, ionic strength) and can be a driving force for guest localization within the host cavity (DOI:10.1002/chem.201605394; DOI:10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004).', 'Hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effects, π-π stacking, and metal coordination are also commonly exploited in IDA host-guest systems, often in combination with electrostatic interactions to enhance selectivity and binding affinity.', 'Host-guest interactions can be monitored optically via fluorescence, UV-Vis spectroscopy, or NMR, with displacement of an indicator (dye or probe) providing a measurable signal change (DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081; DOI:10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Host-guest systems such as β-cyclodextrin, cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), and cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) are frequently used, with guests including small organic molecules, dyes, and biomolecules.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest interactions are a central concept in supramolecular chemistry and molecular recognition, underpinning the selectivity and sensitivity of IDAs.', 'Electrostatic interactions are a subclass of non-covalent forces, including both attractions and repulsions, and are often complemented by other interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic effects to achieve high-affinity binding.', 'The effectiveness of a given host-guest interaction in IDA design depends on the chemical nature of both host and guest, the presence of functional groups (e.g., sulfonate, ammonium, carbonyl), and the physicochemical environment (e.g., solvent, pH, ionic strength).', "Optical detection in IDAs relies on measurable changes in the indicator's properties (e.g., fluorescence intensity, absorbance) upon displacement, which is directly linked to the strength and specificity of the host-guest interaction.", 'Host-guest interactions are not only used for sensing but also for constructing biomaterials, deciphering molecular binding modes, and developing new disease treatments, highlighting their versatility (DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).'], 'relationships': ['Electrostatic interactions often occur between specific functional groups, such as lysine residues and sulfonate groups, or between cationic hosts and anionic guests (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'Host-guest complexes can be formed in aqueous environments (e.g., D2O), and their formation/displacement can be analyzed by fluorescence, UV-Vis, and NMR spectroscopy (DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081; DOI:10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Electrostatic interactions can be entropically canceled by solute-solvent and solvent reorganization entropies, affecting the net binding energetics (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Host-guest recognition is a hierarchical concept, with electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions as subclasses of supramolecular interactions, all contributing to the overall binding and selectivity in IDAs.', 'The selectivity of electrostatic interactions can be less relevant for zwitterionic or neutral guests, emphasizing the need to tailor host-guest chemistry to the target analyte.']}
