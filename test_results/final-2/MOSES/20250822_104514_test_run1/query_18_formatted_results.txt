{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind anions through anion-π interactions are electron-deficient macrocyclic hosts, including triazolophanes, triazine-based hosts, naphthalimide-containing macrocycles, and certain foldamers and cyclophanes with electron-deficient aromatic surfaces.', 'key_points': ['Anion-π interactions are a specific type of noncovalent interaction where an anion is stabilized by the π-system of an electron-deficient aromatic ring within a host molecule.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as triazolophanes, triazine-based macrocycles, naphthalimide-containing macrocycles, and electron-deficient cyclophanes are specifically designed to present electron-deficient π-surfaces for anion binding.', 'Foldamers with electron-deficient aromatic units and molecular clips with π-acidic surfaces can also act as anion-π hosts.', 'These hosts often feature rigid, preorganized cavities or surfaces that maximize the overlap between the anion and the π-system, enhancing selectivity and binding strength.', 'Electron-deficient cavities are a key structural feature, often achieved by incorporating electron-withdrawing groups or heteroatoms into the aromatic framework.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are a relatively recent addition to the supramolecular chemist’s toolkit, complementing more traditional anion binding motifs such as hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions.', 'The strength and selectivity of anion-π binding depend on the electron deficiency of the aromatic surface, which can be tuned by chemical modification (e.g., triazine, triazole, or naphthalimide incorporation).', 'Macrocyclic hosts (macrocycles, calixarenes, cyclophanes, triazolophanes) provide a preorganized, often rigid, framework that enhances the directionality and strength of anion-π interactions.', 'Triazolophanes are a prototypical class of anion-π hosts, featuring multiple triazole rings that create a highly electron-deficient π-surface ideal for anion binding.', 'Triazine-based hosts and naphthalimide-containing macrocycles are also prominent due to their strong π-acidity and ability to form stable host-guest complexes with anions.', 'Foldamers and molecular clips can be engineered to present extended π-acidic surfaces, further broadening the scope of anion-π recognition.', 'Anion-π interactions are typically weaker than classical hydrogen bonds but can be highly selective and are often used in combination with other noncovalent interactions for enhanced binding.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocyclic hosts (e.g., triazolophanes, triazine-based macrocycles) are subtypes of supramolecular hosts and are specifically designed to exploit anion-π interactions by presenting electron-deficient aromatic surfaces.', 'Electron-deficient cavities are a unifying structural feature among these hosts, achieved by incorporating electron-withdrawing groups or heteroatoms (e.g., triazine, triazole, naphthalimide) into the macrocyclic framework.', 'Noncovalent interactions, including anion-π, hydrogen bonding, and π-π stacking, often act synergistically in these systems to enhance anion binding affinity and selectivity.', 'Foldamers and molecular clips expand the design space for anion-π hosts by enabling non-macrocyclic, yet highly preorganized, π-acidic binding sites.', 'The design of these hosts is informed by computational methods (e.g., DFT optimization) and structure-property relationships, allowing fine-tuning of binding affinity and selectivity for specific anions.']}
