{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) can detect a wide range of molecules, including small organic compounds, metal cations, anions, drugs, and biological molecules, by exploiting competitive binding interactions with synthetic or supramolecular receptors.', 'key_points': ['IDAs are capable of detecting diverse analytes such as trimethylated lysine, caffeine, choline, butyrylcholine, betaine, and various choline analogs.', 'The assay can target classes of molecules including metal cations, anions, drugs, and biological molecules (e.g., peptides, proteins, nucleic acids).', 'Specific examples of detectable molecules include amino acids (e.g., lysine, arginine, tryptophan), peptides (e.g., H3 histone tail, tripeptides), nucleic acids (DNA, RNA), and small molecule drugs (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, cocaine).', 'IDAs can be performed in complex environments such as aqueous solutions, lipid membranes, and live cells, enabling detection in biologically relevant contexts.', 'Quantitative detection is possible, with reported association constants (e.g., 2.0 Ã— 10^2 for certain analyte-receptor complexes).', 'Detection is based on non-covalent, competitive binding, often monitored via optical (fluorescent or colorimetric) signals.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are a class of supramolecular analytical techniques that utilize a competitive binding mechanism: an indicator dye is initially bound to a receptor, and the presence of an analyte displaces the indicator, resulting in a measurable signal change.', 'IDAs are highly versatile due to the modularity of their components: the receptor (e.g., calixarene, deep cavitand, cyclodextrin, pillararene), the indicator (e.g., lucigenin, safranine T, fluorescent dyes), and the analyte.', 'The technique is compatible with differential sensing strategies, allowing for the discrimination of structurally similar analytes in complex mixtures (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'IDAs are widely used in supramolecular analytical chemistry for applications such as drug detection, biomarker sensing, and environmental monitoring.', 'The method is particularly suited for optical sensing, with outputs including fluorescence, absorbance, or colorimetric changes, and can be adapted for use in live cells or membrane constructs (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'The selectivity and sensitivity of IDAs depend on the choice of receptor and indicator, as well as the binding affinity for the target analyte.'], 'relationships': ['IDAs rely on competitive, non-covalent interactions between the analyte and the indicator for binding to a synthetic receptor, leading to displacement and signal generation.', 'The analyte can form parallel or perpendicular complexes with the receptor (e.g., calixarene), and the stability of these complexes is preserved under assay conditions (DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F).', "Receptors such as deep cavitands, calixarenes, and cyclodextrins provide molecular recognition elements that determine the assay's selectivity for specific analytes.", 'The modular nature of IDA components (receptor, indicator, analyte) allows for broad adaptability to different molecular targets, including post-translationally modified proteins, small molecule drugs, and ions.', 'IDAs are compatible with differential sensing arrays, enhancing their ability to distinguish between closely related analytes in complex samples (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).']}
