{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind anions via anion-π interactions are aromatic macrocycles, including calixarenes, cyclophanes, and related macrocyclic and acyclic aromatic receptors, as well as molecular tweezers and foldamers with electron-deficient aromatic surfaces.', 'key_points': ['Aromatic macrocycles (e.g., calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes) are the principal supramolecular hosts that bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions, leveraging their electron-deficient aromatic cavities or surfaces.', 'Calixarenes, especially sulfonatocalix[n]arenes (e.g., SCX4, SCX6), are well-established for anion-π binding due to their bowl-shaped, π-rich cavities and tunable functionalization (e.g., upper/lower rim modifications, hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance).', 'Cyclophanes, including both neutral and charged (anionic/cationic) derivatives, provide rigid, preorganized aromatic platforms for anion-π recognition, with dissociation constants reported in the low micromolar range (e.g., 50 μM for some synthetic cyclophanes).', 'Molecular tweezers with electron-deficient aromatic arms (e.g., perylene bisimide, crown ether derivatives) can bind anions in pocket-like, π-rich environments, with high affinity at micromolar or sub-micromolar concentrations.', 'Foldamers, particularly those incorporating triazole or phenylene units, can present extended π-surfaces for anion-π binding, and are often water-soluble with hydrophobic interiors and hydrophilic exteriors, enabling anion binding in aqueous media.', 'Acyclic aromatic receptors and certain cavitands/cavitand derivatives can also participate in anion-π binding, though macrocyclic hosts are generally more preorganized and selective.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are noncovalent, attractive forces between an electron-deficient aromatic π-system and an anion, and are generally weaker than hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions but can be highly selective when properly engineered (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes and cyclophanes are favored for anion-π recognition due to their rigid, preorganized aromatic frameworks, which reduce entropic penalties and enhance selectivity (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Calixarenes can be extensively functionalized at the upper and lower rims, allowing for fine-tuning of cavity size, hydrophobicity, and charge, which is critical for optimizing anion-π binding in different solvents (e.g., water vs. organic media).', 'Cyclophanes, as cyclic arrangements of aromatic units (e.g., xylene, ethenoanthracene), provide a tunable π-electronic environment and can be designed to favor anion-π over cation-π or hydrogen bonding interactions.', 'Molecular tweezers and foldamers offer semi-rigid, open-chain or helical architectures that can present π-surfaces in a convergent fashion, mimicking biological recognition sites and enabling selective anion binding even in competitive aqueous environments.', 'Anion-π binding is often enhanced in electron-deficient aromatic systems (e.g., perfluorinated aromatics, nitro-substituted rings), and the presence of hydrophobic cavities or confined environments further stabilizes the anion-π complex.', 'Anion-π interactions are typically characterized by NMR titration, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and X-ray crystallography, with binding affinities ranging from micromolar to nanomolar depending on host design and solvent conditions.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes and cyclophanes are both macrocyclic hosts with aromatic π-surfaces, but calixarenes offer greater synthetic flexibility for functionalization, while cyclophanes provide more rigid, preorganized cavities.', 'Molecular tweezers and foldamers represent a bridge between macrocyclic and acyclic hosts, combining the preorganization of macrocycles with the modularity of acyclic systems.', 'The effectiveness of anion-π binding is closely related to the electron deficiency of the aromatic surface, the preorganization of the host, and the ability to exclude competing interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, cation-π).', 'Water solubility and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance are critical for anion-π binding in biological or aqueous environments, and are often achieved through rim modifications or incorporation of solubilizing groups (e.g., sulfonates, tri(ethylene glycol)).', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes and cyclophanes are structurally related to biological recognition sites (e.g., aromatic cages in proteins), and their design is often inspired by natural systems (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Anion-π interactions are one of several noncovalent forces (alongside hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions) that contribute to the overall selectivity and affinity of supramolecular anion receptors.']}
