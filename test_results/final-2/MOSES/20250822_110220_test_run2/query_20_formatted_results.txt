{'summary': 'Non-covalent interactions, particularly hydrogen bonds and anion-π interactions, play critical roles in the formation, stabilization, and selectivity of supramolecular host-guest complexes by mediating molecular recognition and self-assembly processes.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonds directly stabilize host-guest complexes and specific conformations (e.g., vase form, dimeric capsules), with typical bond distances ranging from 2.508 Å to 2.968 Å (DOI: 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Hydrogen bonds are formed between functional groups such as carbonyl oxygen atoms and pyridine NH binding sites, and are present in a variety of host-guest systems, including complexes with amine linkers and nucleobases.', 'Hydrogen bonding is a primary contributor to selectivity and is validated by advanced analyses (e.g., atoms-in-molecules, reduced density gradients;
