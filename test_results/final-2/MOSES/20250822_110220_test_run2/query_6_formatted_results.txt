{'summary': 'Cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, crown ethers, and related macrocyclic host molecules utilize host-guest recognition mechanisms in electrochemical assays, enabling selective detection and signal transduction through non-covalent interactions with guest molecules.', 'key_points': ['Key host molecules used in electrochemical assays via host-guest recognition include cyclodextrins (α-, β-, γ-CD and derivatives), cucurbiturils (CB[n], especially CB(7), CB(8)), calixarenes (calix[n]arene, sulfonatocalixarenes, derivatives), and crown ethers.', 'These host molecules possess macrocyclic cavities (e.g., large bowl-shaped or toroidal) that enable the formation of inclusion complexes with guest molecules, such as drug molecules, ions, or aromatic compounds.', 'Host-guest recognition is mediated by non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic effects, charge transfer), which are critical for selective binding and signal modulation in electrochemical assays.', 'Host molecules can reduce the critical aggregation concentration of guest molecules, promote aggregation of amphiphilic or aromatic guests, and facilitate charge transfer, all of which can modulate electrochemical signals.', 'Quantitative data: For example, host-guest systems may involve up to 3000 water molecules in the solvation shell (10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479), and electron localization function (ELF) mapping shows electron condensation in interacting regions (10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest recognition is a cornerstone of supramolecular chemistry, enabling molecular recognition, signal transduction, and amplification in electrochemical sensors and assays.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, and crown ethers are widely used due to their tunable cavity sizes, chemical functionality, and water solubility, which are essential for compatibility with electrochemical platforms.', 'The formation of inclusion complexes (host-guest complexes) is often optimized using computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT) to predict equilibrium geometries and binding energies (10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Host-guest interactions can alter the chemical hardness of the system (typically decreased after adsorption), and can be monitored by changes in electrostatic potential (ESP) and electron density distribution.', 'Electrochemical assays benefit from the selectivity and reversibility of host-guest interactions, allowing for the detection of a wide range of analytes, including drugs, ions, and biomolecules, with high sensitivity and specificity.'], 'relationships': ['Host molecules form inclusion complexes with guest molecules, which is central to their function in electrochemical assays (10.1007/s10847-018-0786-0).', 'Macrocyclic hosts interact with functional groups such as NH and OH groups, and with π-systems of drug molecules, facilitating selective recognition (10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Charge transfer and π-bonding between host and guest molecules can directly influence electrochemical signal output.', 'Host-guest complexation can be modulated by protonation state, aggregation behavior, and the presence of water or other solvents, affecting assay performance.', 'The structural diversity of macrocyclic hosts (e.g., different ring sizes, functionalization) allows for tailored selectivity and sensitivity in electrochemical applications.']}
