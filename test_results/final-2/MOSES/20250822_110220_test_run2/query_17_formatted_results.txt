{'summary': 'Cage molecules and macrocycles both serve as hosts in supramolecular chemistry, with overlapping applications in molecular recognition, host-guest chemistry, and drug delivery, but differ in their structural features and specific application profilesâ€”cages excel in encapsulation and 3D guest isolation, while macrocycles are more versatile in 2D host-guest interactions, ion binding, and catalysis.', 'key_points': ['Both cage molecules and macrocycles are central to host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and drug delivery systems, but their structural differences lead to distinct application emphases.', 'Cage molecules (including molecular cages and capsules) are particularly suited for molecular encapsulation, providing a 3D cavity that can fully enclose guests such as small molecules, ions, or functional groups (e.g., accommodating indole rings or methyl groups).', 'Macrocycles (e.g., cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararenes) are highly developed for 2D host-guest interactions, ion binding, ion transport, catalysis, and sensing, often forming inclusion complexes and enabling selective molecular recognition via their hydrophobic cavities.', 'Macrocyclic hosts and receptors are widely used in catalysis, chemosensing, fluorescence switching, nanotechnology, separation, and as artificial receptors for biomolecules, ions, and drugs.', 'Overlapping applications include drug delivery (as carriers or delivery vehicles), molecular recognition (of amino acids, peptides, proteins, and small molecules), and formation of host-guest complexes for sensing and separation.', 'Macrocycles are more frequently used for ion binding and transport, while cages are more specialized for complete molecular encapsulation and isolation of reactive species or unstable intermediates.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest chemistry is a subfield of supramolecular chemistry focused on noncovalent interactions between a host (macrocycle or cage) and a guest molecule, with applications in aqueous and biological environments.', 'Macrocycles are typically planar or cyclic structures with a defined cavity, enabling selective binding of guests through hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions; common macrocycles include cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and pillararenes.', 'Cage molecules are 3D, often polyhedral, structures that can encapsulate guests entirely, providing unique microenvironments for chemical reactions, stabilization of labile species, and protection from external influences.', 'Both classes are integral to the development of molecular machines, smart materials, and supramolecular assemblies, with macrocycles often serving as building blocks for larger supramolecular architectures.', 'Analytical techniques for studying host-guest systems include fluorescence spectroscopy, NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry, and UV-Vis spectroscopy, which provide quantitative data on binding constants, stoichiometry, and guest conformations.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are often functionalized to enhance selectivity, solubility, or binding affinity, and can be tailored for specific applications such as drug delivery (e.g., water-soluble hosts for biological compatibility).', 'Cage molecules are increasingly used in materials science for encapsulation, controlled release, and as nanoreactors for catalysis.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles and cages both participate in host-guest chemistry, but macrocycles are more commonly used for 2D inclusion complexes, while cages provide 3D encapsulation.', 'Macrocyclic hosts and receptors are subtypes of macrocycles, with specialized roles in molecular recognition, catalysis, and drug delivery; many macrocycles (e.g., cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins) are also used as hosts in cage-like assemblies.', "Host-guest complexes formed by macrocycles and cages are stabilized by noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, electrostatic and dispersion forces), with the nature of the interaction influenced by the host's structure (planar vs. 3D).", 'Macrocycles and cages are both involved in supramolecular chemistry, contributing to the development of molecular machines, smart materials, and nanotechnology applications.', 'There is significant overlap in the use of macrocycles and cages for drug delivery, molecular recognition, and sensing, but cages are uniquely suited for complete guest encapsulation and isolation, while macrocycles excel in selective binding and transport of ions and small molecules.']}
