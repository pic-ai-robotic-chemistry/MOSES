{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests via cation-π interactions are calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, and, to a lesser extent, cucurbiturils, with calixarenes and pillararenes being especially prominent due to their electron-rich aromatic cavities.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes (e.g., calix(4)arene, calix(6)arene, sulfonatocalixarenes) are archetypal hosts for cation-π binding, with their bowl-shaped, electron-rich aromatic cavities facilitating strong interactions with cationic guests such as methylated lysines and ammonium ions.', 'Pillararenes (notably pillar[5]arene and its derivatives) possess electron-rich, rigid, cylindrical cavities that enable selective cation-π interactions, particularly with amine-containing guests.', 'Cyclophanes, including various substituted derivatives, act as synthetic receptors for cationic guests (e.g., alkylammonium ions) via cation-π interactions, leveraging their aromatic ring systems.', 'Cucurbiturils (e.g., CB[7], CB[8]) can participate in cation-π interactions, especially with aromatic side chains of amino acids, but their primary binding mode often involves ion-dipole and hydrophobic effects; cation-π contributions are significant in certain contexts (e.g., methylated lysine recognition).', 'Macrocycles as a broader class (including the above) are structurally adapted for cation-π recognition, with exposed aromatic surfaces and hydrophobic cavities enhancing selectivity and affinity for cationic guests.'], 'background_information': ['Cation-π interactions are non-covalent forces between a cation and the π-electron cloud of an aromatic system, playing a critical role in molecular recognition, especially for biologically relevant targets such as methylated amino acids and neurotransmitters.', 'Calixarenes are synthesized via condensation reactions and can be functionalized at the upper or lower rim to tune selectivity and solubility; sulfonatocalixarenes are particularly water-soluble and effective in biological media.', 'Pillararenes, with their rigid, electron-rich cavities, are used for selective recognition of methylated lysines and other cationic species, and can be modified to enhance water solubility or introduce additional binding motifs.', 'Cyclophanes are cyclic aromatic compounds that mimic biological recognition sites and are used as synthetic receptors for organic cations, often studied for their host-guest chemistry and binding affinity for neurotransmitters and peptides.', 'Cucurbiturils, while primarily known for ion-dipole and hydrophobic interactions, can also engage in cation-π interactions, especially with aromatic cationic guests; their high binding affinities and selectivity make them valuable in catalysis, sensing, and biomedical applications.', 'Host-guest interactions involving cation-π binding are typically characterized by NMR spectroscopy, fluorescence, isothermal titration calorimetry, and quantum chemical calculations, with association constants (Ka) and binding free energies providing quantitative measures of affinity.', 'Supramolecular hosts are often designed to discriminate between methylation states of amino acids (e.g., trimethyllysine vs. unmethylated lysine), with cation-π interactions providing the necessary selectivity and strength to outcompete native protein readers in biological environments (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes, pillararenes, and cyclophanes are all aromatic macrocycles, sharing a common structural motif that enables cation-π recognition; their differences in cavity size, shape, and functionalization dictate guest selectivity and binding strength.', 'Cation-π interactions are often complemented by other non-covalent forces (e.g., hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effects, ion-dipole interactions) within the host cavity, leading to enhanced selectivity and affinity for specific guests.', 'Functionalization of host molecules (e.g., sulfonation of calixarenes, introduction of charged groups in pillararenes) modulates solubility, cavity polarity, and binding properties, allowing for fine-tuning of cation-π interaction strength and selectivity.', 'Supramolecular hosts are inspired by natural protein recognition motifs (e.g., methyl reader proteins) but offer smaller interaction surfaces and can be engineered for selectivity toward post-translationally modified amino acids, functioning as sequestration agents or affinity reagents in chemical biology (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'The interplay between host structure (aromaticity, cavity size, rigidity) and guest properties (cationic charge, aromaticity, methylation state) determines the thermodynamics and kinetics of cation-π-driven host-guest complexation.']}
