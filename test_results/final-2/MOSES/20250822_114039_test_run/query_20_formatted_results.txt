{'summary': 'Non-covalent interactions, particularly hydrogen bonds and anion-π interactions, are fundamental to the formation, stabilization, and selectivity of supramolecular host-guest complexes, governing their affinity, specificity, and dynamic behavior.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonds and anion-π interactions are key non-covalent forces that drive the assembly and stabilization of supramolecular host-guest complexes (host-guest_complex, host_guest_complex, supramolecular_host_guest_complex).', 'Hydrogen bonds stabilize host-guest complexes by providing directional, specific interactions between host and guest, often involving NH-donor sites and polar functional groups (e.g., host-guest complexes with amino acids, peptides, or nucleobases).', 'Anion-π interactions, a subtype of non-covalent interaction, contribute to the binding and selectivity of anionic guests within electron-deficient aromatic host cavities, enhancing affinity and selectivity for specific anions (e.g., I-, ClO4-, SCN-).', 'Quantitative binding data: Host-guest complexes exhibit high binding constants (e.g., Ka > 10^4 M^-1, up to 10^6 M^-1 for strong complexes), with selectivity and stability modulated by the nature and arrangement of non-covalent interactions (DOI: 10.1021/ja0727058, 10.1039/c8ob02180e).', 'Hydrogen bonding networks can be formed by water molecules within hydrophobic host cavities, further stabilizing the complex and influencing guest dynamics (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479).', 'Host-guest complex stoichiometry is typically 1:1, but higher-order complexes (e.g., 2:1) are possible depending on the host and guest structure (e.g., Q(8)-AC, DOI: 10.1039/D0QO00649A).', 'The presence and strength of non-covalent interactions are confirmed by experimental techniques such as NMR, ITC, X-ray crystallography, and fluorescence titration, and are supported by computational modeling (DFT, molecular dynamics).'], 'background_information': ['Non-covalent interactions include hydrogen bonding, anion-π, cation-π, van der Waals, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions;
