{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) can detect a wide range of molecules, including metal ions, anions, biomolecules (such as amino acids and proteins), and small organic molecules, by exploiting competitive binding interactions with a host–indicator complex.', 'key_points': ['IDAs are capable of detecting: (1) metal ions (e.g., Cu(II), Fe(III)), (2) a broad spectrum of anions (e.g., halides, oxoanions, Hofmeister series anions), (3) biomolecules (amino acids, peptides, proteins, nucleic acids), and (4) small organic molecules (including metabolites and drug-like compounds).', 'Metal ions detected by IDA include Cu(II) and Fe(III), with binding constants that are moderate in competitive aqueous media (DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02541).', 'Anions detectable by IDA span a wide range, including halides (Cl−, Br−, I−), oxoanions (sulfate, phosphate, oxalate, perchlorate, perrhenate, pertechnetate), and more complex or highly charged species (e.g., SCX4, SCX6).', 'Biomolecules detected include amino acids (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine), peptides (e.g., histone tails, methylated lysine derivatives), proteins (e.g., insulin, hemoglobin, lysozyme), and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA).', 'Small organic molecules recognized by IDA include amino acid derivatives, carbohydrates (e.g., glucose), and other metabolites.', 'Anion binding in IDA is often characterized by 1:1 host–guest stoichiometry, with affinities ranked by the Hofmeister series and influenced by solvation and hydration properties (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are supramolecular sensing techniques where an analyte displaces a pre-bound indicator from a host, resulting in a measurable signal change (often optical or fluorescent).', "The selectivity and sensitivity of IDA depend on the host's binding affinity for both the indicator and the analyte, as well as the competitive environment (e.g., solvent, presence of competing ions).", "Metal ions act as Lewis acids and are coordinated by host molecules, with their detection modulated by the first coordination sphere and the host's structural features (DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02541).", "Anion detection is influenced by the anion's position in the Hofmeister series, with more weakly hydrated (salting-in) anions generally showing higher affinities for hydrophobic or nonpolar host sites (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).", 'Anion–host interactions are governed by Coulombic, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces, and are often measured by NMR titration or isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', 'Biomolecule detection by IDA leverages specific recognition of side chains, post-translational modifications (e.g., methylation, acetylation), or secondary structure motifs by the host.', 'Small organic molecules, including metabolites and drug-like compounds, are recognized by hosts such as cavitands, calixarenes, and cyclodextrins, which can be tailored for selectivity.', 'The competitive binding environment (e.g., water, presence of amphiphiles or other ions) can modulate the sensitivity and selectivity of IDA-based detection.'], 'relationships': ['Metal ions and anions both serve as analytes in IDA, often competing for the same host binding sites; their relative affinities are influenced by solvation, hydration, and host structure.', 'Anion binding is ranked by the Hofmeister series, with more polarizable, weakly hydrated anions (e.g., I−, ReO4−) showing stronger binding to nonpolar host sites (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Anion–host interactions are mediated by multiple noncovalent forces (Coulombic, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals), and the degree of desolvation upon binding is typically partial, analogous to interface desolvation.', 'Biomolecules and small organic molecules can be detected by IDA if they compete effectively with the indicator for the host, often requiring specific structural or functional group recognition.', 'The host–guest binding model in IDA is frequently 1:1, but can vary depending on the analyte and host design.', 'Solvent and competing species (e.g., amphiphiles, other ions) can compete with analytes for host binding, affecting assay performance and selectivity.']}
