{'summary': 'A wide range of host-guest interactions—including hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic effects, and coordination bonds—can induce changes in electrochemical signals by modulating the electronic environment or accessibility of redox-active species.', 'key_points': ['Host-guest interactions that induce electrochemical signal changes include: hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, van der Waals interactions, electrostatic attraction/repulsion, hydrophobic interactions, ion-dipole interactions, and coordination complex formation.', 'Specific host-guest complexes (e.g., pseudorotaxanes, inclusion complexes, charge-transfer complexes) and macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils CB7/CB8, calixarenes, cyclodextrins) are involved in these processes.', 'Host-guest displacement events (e.g., quinine displacing methylene blue from β-cyclodextrin) can directly modulate electrochemical signals by altering the redox environment.', 'Host-guest interactions are effective strategies for deciphering molecular binding modes, constructing biomaterials, and developing new disease treatments, often studied using fluorescence, UV-Vis, and NMR spectroscopy.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest chemistry is a specialization of supramolecular chemistry, focusing on non-covalent molecular recognition between a host (often a macrocycle or molecular cage) and a guest (small molecule, ion, or biomolecule).', 'Non-covalent supramolecular interactions (hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, van der Waals, hydrophobic, and electrostatic) are central to the assembly and function of host-guest systems, and their modulation can be exploited in electrochemical sensors and molecular recognition platforms.', 'Host-guest interactions are influenced by factors such as solvent (e.g., D2O), co-solutes, salt concentration, and the structure of the solute, which can affect the strength and selectivity of binding and thus the electrochemical response.', 'Applications of supramolecular host-guest chemistry include catalysis, drug delivery, nanotechnology, optical and electrochemical sensing, and the design of stimuli-responsive materials.', 'Experimental analysis of host-guest interactions often employs fluorescence data, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and 1H NMR spectroscopy to monitor binding events and their effects on electronic properties (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081; 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).'], 'relationships': ['Host-guest interactions form specific complexes (e.g., 1:1, 2:1, charge-transfer, inclusion complexes) that can alter the accessibility or redox properties of guest molecules, leading to measurable changes in electrochemical signals.', 'Macrocyclic hosts (CB7, CB8, calixarenes, cyclodextrins) provide defined cavities for guest binding, and the nature of the interaction (hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, etc.) determines the selectivity and sensitivity of electrochemical response.', 'Displacement of one guest by another (e.g., quinine displacing methylene blue from β-cyclodextrin) is a dynamic process that can be harnessed for signal transduction in chemical sensors.', 'Host-guest interactions are not only central to molecular recognition but also to the construction of functional materials and devices, with their properties tunable by external stimuli or environmental conditions.']}
