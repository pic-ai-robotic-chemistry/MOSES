{'summary': 'Cage molecules and macrocycles are both pivotal in supramolecular chemistry, with overlapping applications in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, encapsulation, catalysis, and drug delivery, but they differ in structural features and specific application profiles due to their distinct three-dimensional (cages) versus two-dimensional (macrocycles) architectures.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules (molecular cages) are three-dimensional, hollow structures capable of encapsulating guest molecules such as methyl groups and indole rings, making them highly effective for molecular encapsulation and selective guest binding.', 'Macrocycles are typically two-dimensional or quasi-planar ring structures with a central cavity, widely used as supramolecular hosts for molecular recognition, catalysis, drug delivery, chemosensing, and as building blocks for nanostructures and artificial light-harvesting systems.', 'Both cages and macrocycles participate in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and encapsulation, but cages offer a more enclosed environment, enhancing selectivity and protection of guests, while macrocycles provide easier access and tunable binding through functionalization.', 'Macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, pillararenes) are extensively used in catalysis, drug delivery, fluorescence switching, molecular sensing, and nanotechnology, often leveraging their hydrophobic cavities and ability to form inclusion complexes.', 'Macrocycles are integral to supramolecular assemblies, with applications in bioimaging, photodynamic therapy, targeted drug delivery, and light-harvesting energy transfer, often due to their stimulus-responsive and preorganized binding site geometries.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular chemistry focuses on noncovalent interactions and the design of host-guest systems, with macrocycles and cages as central motifs for creating molecular machines, sensors, and delivery vehicles.', 'Host-guest chemistry is a subfield where both macrocycles and cages are used to form complexes with guest molecules, studied by techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, NMR, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', 'Molecular recognition by macrocycles is governed by weak interactions (hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, ion-dipole interactions), with selectivity influenced by cavity size, rigidity, and functional group modification.', 'Encapsulation by cages and macrocycles can modulate guest properties, such as fluorescence intensity, and protect against quenching or degradation, with applications in sensing and controlled release.', 'Macrocyclic systems are being developed to improve chemotherapy drug delivery, leveraging their ability to encapsulate and transport drugs to targeted sites, while cages offer enhanced guest protection and selectivity due to their closed architecture.', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies are key in advanced applications like topological morphology control and stimulus-responsive systems, often using cucurbiturils and cyclodextrins as structural motifs.'], 'relationships': ['Cage molecules and macrocycles both function as hosts in host-guest chemistry, but cages provide a more enclosed, protective environment for guests, while macrocycles offer greater accessibility and tunability.', 'Macrocycles are structurally related to cages; some macrocycles can be precursors or components of cage-like architectures, and both can be functionalized for specific recognition or delivery tasks.', 'Macrocyclic hosts have subtypes (e.g., cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, pillararenes) that are widely used in supramolecular chemistry for diverse applications, often overlapping with those of cages in encapsulation and molecular recognition.', 'Both classes are integral to supramolecular assemblies, with macrocycles often serving as the key component in stimulus-responsive and multifunctional systems, while cages are favored for applications requiring high selectivity and guest protection.', 'The effectiveness of both cages and macrocycles in molecular recognition and encapsulation is influenced by their cavity size, rigidity, and functional group composition, which can be tailored for specific applications.']}
