{'summary': 'The primary host molecules that utilize host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays are cyclodextrins (especially β-cyclodextrin), calixarenes (including derivatives and sulfonated forms), and cucurbiturils (notably CB7 and CB8). These macrocyclic hosts form selective, non-covalent complexes with guest molecules, enabling sensitive and selective electrochemical detection of analytes.', 'key_points': ['Cyclodextrins (CDs), especially β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), are widely used as host molecules in electrochemical assays, forming inclusion complexes with guests such as methylene blue (MB) and quinine. β-CD is specifically cited as the host in the first integration of host-guest recognition with electrochemical assays for quinine determination.', 'Calixarenes, including sulfonated and water-soluble derivatives (e.g., p-sulfonatocalix(4)arene, calixarene_6, calixarene_14), are employed as host molecules for electrochemical sensing, with high selectivity for methylated lysine, trimethyllysine, and other biomolecules. Calixarene-based systems are also used in fluorescent and affinity-based electrochemical sensors.', 'Cucurbiturils, particularly CB7 and CB8, are macrocyclic hosts with high affinity and selectivity for amino acids, peptides, and aromatic/cationic residues. They are used in indicator displacement assays (IDAs) and electrochemical sensors for analytes such as tryptophan and quinine, with binding constants up to 10^6 M^-1 and nanomolar detection limits.', 'Host-guest complexes in these systems are typically characterized by 1:1 stoichiometry, high binding constants (e.g., 10^4–10^6 M^-1), and are stabilized by hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding interactions. The selectivity can be tuned by host structure and functionalization (e.g., rim modifications in calixarenes, cavity size in cucurbiturils).', 'Electrochemical sensors based on these host-guest systems demonstrate high selectivity, reproducibility (relative standard deviation ~2%), reusability, and stability (e.g., >86% signal retention over 21 days), and are verified by techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest recognition is a central concept in supramolecular chemistry, involving the selective, non-covalent binding of a guest molecule within the cavity of a host. This principle is exploited in electrochemical assays to achieve high selectivity and sensitivity for target analytes.', 'Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides with hydrophobic inner cavities and hydrophilic exteriors, enabling them to encapsulate hydrophobic guests. They are commercially available, affordable, and have a long history of use in analytical chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and food science. Their binding is primarily driven by hydrophobic effects, with binding constants for analytes and indicators typically in the 10^3–10^5 M^-1 range.', 'Calixarenes are phenolic macrocycles with tunable cavity sizes and rim functionalities. They are easier to modify than cucurbiturils, allowing for tailored selectivity and water solubility. Calixarene derivatives can be functionalized with hydrophilic groups to enhance solubility and biocompatibility, and are used for the recognition of methylated lysines, neurotransmitters, and drugs. Selectivity ratios for trimethyllysine can reach 150 (calixarene_6) with dissociation constants in the low micromolar range.', 'Cucurbiturils are rigid, barrel-shaped macrocycles composed of glycoluril units. CB7 and CB8 are the most commonly used homologues in electrochemical sensing, with cavity sizes suitable for encapsulating aromatic and cationic guests. Their binding is driven by hydrophobic and ion-dipole interactions, with binding affinities ranging from 10^3 to 10^12 M^-1 depending on the guest. They are highly selective for aromatic/cationic residues and are used in fluorescent indicator displacement assays (F-IDAs) and electrochemical sensors.', 'Host-guest complexation is typically monitored and characterized by NMR, fluorescence titration, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and mass spectrometry. Electrochemical sensors based on these systems are constructed using nanocomposites and are validated by multiple analytical techniques. The use of host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays allows for the detection of analytes in complex biological matrices (e.g., urine) with high specificity and minimal interference.', 'The selectivity and sensitivity of these systems can be further enhanced by modifying the host structure (e.g., rim functionalization in calixarenes, cavity size in cucurbiturils, alkylation in cyclodextrins) and by optimizing assay conditions (e.g., pH, buffer composition, co-binders).'], 'relationships': ['Host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays is realized through the formation of stable, selective complexes between macrocyclic hosts (cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils) and guest analytes (e.g., drugs, amino acids, peptides, dyes).', 'The integration of host-guest systems with electrochemical sensors is often achieved via indicator displacement assays (IDAs), where the binding of the analyte displaces a reporter molecule (e.g., methylene blue), resulting in a measurable electrochemical signal.', "The selectivity of the host-guest system is determined by the complementarity between the host cavity and the guest's size, shape, and charge. For example, CB7 and CB8 show high selectivity for aromatic/cationic residues, while calixarenes can be tuned for methylated lysines by rim modification.", 'Electrochemical sensors based on these host-guest systems benefit from the modularity and tunability of the host structure, allowing for the development of sensors with tailored selectivity, sensitivity, and stability for specific analytical applications.', 'There is a strong methodological relationship between supramolecular host-guest chemistry and the development of advanced electrochemical sensors, with cross-validation by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques ensuring robust analyte detection in real-world samples.']}
