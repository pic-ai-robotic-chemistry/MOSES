{'summary': 'A cryptand is a macrobicyclic ligand designed to encapsulate guest molecules, particularly in host-guest and supramolecular chemistry, enabling selective molecular recognition.', 'key_points': ['Cryptands are macrobicyclic ligands (macrocyclic compounds with two or more bridges) that form three-dimensional cavities capable of encapsulating guest species, especially organic guests (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'They are functionalized with specific dyes such as anthracene and naphthalimide, which can impart selectivity for particular anions (e.g., sulfate) and enable optical sensing capabilities.', 'Cryptands act as molecular receptors, forming stable host-guest complexes (cryptates) through non-covalent interactions, a hallmark of supramolecular chemistry.', 'The encapsulation process is highly selective, often governed by the size, shape, and electronic properties of both the cryptand and the guest molecule.'], 'background_information': ['Cryptands were first developed as an extension of crown ethers, offering enhanced selectivity and binding strength due to their three-dimensional, cage-like structure.', 'They are central to the field of supramolecular chemistry, which studies non-covalent interactions and molecular recognition processes.', 'Cryptands are used in host-guest chemistry to study and exploit selective binding, with applications in ion transport, sensing, and catalysis.', 'Functionalization with fluorescent dyes (e.g., anthracene, naphthalimide) allows cryptands to serve as optical sensors for specific ions or molecules, expanding their utility in analytical and bioanalytical chemistry.', "The term 'cryptate' refers to the complex formed when a cryptand encapsulates a guest ion or molecule, often a metal cation or anion."], 'relationships': ['Cryptands are a subclass of macrobicyclic ligands and receptors, linking them to broader classes involved in molecular recognition and supramolecular chemistry (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'They are directly related to crown ethers but provide greater selectivity and encapsulation ability due to their 3D structure.', "The property 'has_guest' specifies that cryptands encapsulate organic guests, highlighting their role in selective host-guest interactions.", 'Functionalization with anthracene or naphthalimide dyes connects cryptands to the field of chemical sensing, as these modifications enable detection of specific anions such as sulfate.', 'Cryptands are integral to the study of molecular recognition, a foundational concept in supramolecular chemistry, and are related to other receptor molecules through their ability to form stable, selective complexes.']}
