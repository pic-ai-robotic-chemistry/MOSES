{'summary': "Guest molecules for supramolecular hosts encompass a wide range of chemical species, including cations, anions, neutral organic molecules, peptides, dyes, and fullerenes, characterized by their ability to engage in non-covalent interactions and fit within the host's cavity or binding site. Their suitability as guests is determined by structural features such as size, shape, charge, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, and the presence of specific binding motifs or functional groups.", 'key_points': ['Guest molecules include cations (e.g., ammonium, quaternary ammonium salts), anions, neutral organic molecules (alkanes, aromatics, alcohols), peptides, dyes (fluorescein, rhodamine), and fullerenes.', 'Key structural features: presence of binding motifs (e.g., aromatic moieties, pi-pi stacking motifs, imidazole groups), hydrophilic or hydrophobic side groups, alkyl chains, and benzyl groups (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'Guest molecules can be amphiphilic, hydrophilic, or hydrophobic, and may contain positively charged, neutral, or apolar regions.', "Quantitative properties: octanol-water partition coefficient (logP), hydration level (e.g., 'readily hydrated'), and solubility in water are relevant for guest selection (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).", 'Photophysical and photochemical properties (e.g., UV-vis absorption spectrum, blue/red-shifted absorbance peaks, fluorescence response) are often modulated upon complexation (DOI: 10.1039/D0QO00649A; 10.1016/j.dyepig.2016.04.013).', 'Guest molecules may exhibit cooperativity (positive, negative, or non-cooperative binding) and can induce property changes in the host-guest complex (e.g., logic gate, on/off switch, drug delivery system).', "Examples of guest molecules: 1,4-dimethylcyclohexane, 4,4'-bipyridinium salt, 5-fluorouracil, amino acids (lysine, arginine), peptides, naphthalimide derivatives, porphyrins, and various dyes."], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular chemistry relies on non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, electrostatic, pi-pi stacking) for host-guest recognition and assembly.', 'Macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes) provide hydrophobic or hydrophilic cavities that selectively encapsulate guest molecules based on size, shape, and chemical compatibility (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).', "Guest encapsulation can modulate the guest's chemical reactivity, photophysical properties, and stability, enabling applications in sensing, drug delivery, and materials science.", 'The inclusion/exclusion of guests is governed by equilibrium processes, often characterized by titration profiles and interaction parameters (alpha), and can be influenced by the presence of counterions (e.g., bromide) or specific protonation states.', 'The diversity of guest molecules is reflected in the ontology, with hundreds of specific examples ranging from small inorganic ions to complex organic dyes and peptides.', 'Computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT) are used to optimize guest structures and predict binding affinities (DOI: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Guest-induced property changes in host-guest assemblies underpin advanced functional materials, including photofunctional materials, fluorescent sensors, and molecular logic gates (DOI: 10.1016/j.dyepig.2016.04.013).'], 'relationships': ['Guest molecules form host-guest complexes with macrocyclic hosts via non-covalent interactions, with selectivity determined by complementarity in size, shape, and chemical functionality.', 'The presence of specific side groups (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, aromatic, charged) in guests correlates with their affinity for particular host environments (e.g., hydrophobic cavities, charged binding sites).', "Photophysical changes (e.g., absorbance shifts, fluorescence modulation) upon complexation are directly related to the guest's electronic structure and its interaction with the host's microenvironment.", 'Cooperativity in binding (positive, negative, or non-cooperative) reflects the interplay between multiple guest molecules and the host, influencing the stoichiometry and stability of the complex.', 'Guest molecules can induce displacement of other guests (e.g., fluorescent dyes), shift equilibrium states (e.g., vase conformations), or trigger functional responses in the host-guest assembly.', 'The inclusion of guests in macrocyclic hosts is often reversible, allowing dynamic control over assembly and disassembly processes, which is critical for applications in responsive materials and molecular devices.']}
