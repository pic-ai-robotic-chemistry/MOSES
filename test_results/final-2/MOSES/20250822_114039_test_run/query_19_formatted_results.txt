{'summary': "Supramolecular hosts containing pyrrole units are generally effective at binding anions due to the pyrrole NH group's strong hydrogen-bond donating ability, the preorganized multidentate binding sites they form, and the complementary electronic and geometric features of the pyrrole moiety for anion recognition.", 'key_points': ['Pyrrole units possess an NH group that acts as a potent hydrogen-bond donor, enabling strong and directional hydrogen-bonding interactions with anionic guests (hydrogen bond distances typically 2.5–3.0 Å).', 'Supramolecular hosts often arrange multiple pyrrole units to create multidentate anion binding sites, enhancing binding affinity and selectivity through cooperative effects (affinity can exceed standard receptors by several orders of magnitude, e.g., for iodide).', 'The aromatic and heteroaromatic nature of pyrrole contributes to the electronic environment, stabilizing anion binding via π interactions and providing a preorganized, rigid framework for molecular recognition.', 'Hydrogen bonding is the most relevant interaction for selectivity in anion binding, and is stabilized in suitable solvents (organic, polar, or aqueous).', 'Anion binding sites formed by pyrrole-containing hosts are common in functionally important regions of proteins, highlighting their biological relevance.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest chemistry is a specialization of supramolecular chemistry, with a primary goal of molecular recognition, and is realized by macrocyclic compounds, molecular cages, capsules, and receptors (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost, 10.1002/anie.202012315).', 'The effectiveness of anion binding is influenced by the structure of the solute, the nature of the solvent, and the presence of salts or cosolutes (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Hydrogen bonds in these systems are validated by advanced analyses such as atoms-in-molecules and reduced density gradient methods (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Aromatic rings, including pyrrole, can provide shielding effects, hydrophobic contacts, and contribute to the overall dipole of the host, further stabilizing the host-guest complex.', 'Multidentate anion binding sites are often formed by self-assembly and stabilized by hydrophobic collapse, leading to high affinity and selectivity (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Applications of supramolecular host-guest chemistry include drug delivery, catalysis, nanotechnology, and biosensing, demonstrating the practical importance of effective anion binding.'], 'relationships': ['Pyrrole NH groups form strong hydrogen bonds with anions, which is the primary mode of recognition and stabilization in these hosts.', 'Multiple pyrrole units in a host act cooperatively, creating multidentate binding sites that significantly enhance anion affinity and selectivity compared to monodentate systems.', 'The aromatic and heteroaromatic character of pyrrole units contributes to the preorganization and rigidity of the host, optimizing the geometry for anion binding and reducing entropic penalties.', 'Hydrogen bonding interactions are most effective in suitable solvents (organic, polar, or aqueous), and the presence of aromatic walls or rings can further stabilize the complex via π interactions and hydrophobic effects.', 'Anion binding sites in synthetic hosts mimic those found in proteins, underscoring the biomimetic and functional relevance of pyrrole-based supramolecular systems.']}
