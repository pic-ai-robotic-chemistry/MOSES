{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind anions via anion-π interactions are aromatic macrocycles, molecular tweezers, and certain aromatic cages, with macrocycles such as calixarenes, pillararenes, and helicarenes being the most prominent.', 'key_points': ['Aromatic macrocycles (e.g., calixarenes, pillararenes, helicarenes) are the principal supramolecular hosts that utilize anion-π interactions for anion binding, leveraging their electron-deficient aromatic surfaces.', 'Molecular tweezers with aromatic or electron-deficient π-surfaces (e.g., carboxylate, phosphate, and phosphonate molecular tweezers) can bind anions through anion-π interactions, often with high selectivity and tunable cavity size.', 'Aromatic cages, though less common, can be engineered to present multiple π-surfaces for anion binding, but are more typically associated with cation-π interactions.', 'Macrocycles such as 2,6-helic[6]arene, calix[n]arenes (C4A, C5A, C6A, C8A), pillar[n]arenes, and their anionic or electron-deficient derivatives are specifically implicated in anion-π recognition.', 'Technical features supporting anion-π binding include exposed aromatic surfaces, electron-deficient π-systems, and rigid macrocyclic frameworks that preorganize the π-surface for optimal anion interaction.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are noncovalent forces where anions are stabilized above or below electron-deficient aromatic rings, a phenomenon exploited in supramolecular chemistry for selective anion recognition.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes and pillararenes can be chemically modified (e.g., sulfonation, introduction of electron-withdrawing groups) to enhance their anion-π binding capabilities by increasing the electron deficiency of the aromatic rings.', 'Molecular tweezers are typically constructed from two parallel aromatic arms connected by a spacer, creating a cleft that can accommodate anions and facilitate anion-π interactions; their selectivity can be tuned by varying the arm composition and cavity size.', 'Aromatic cages, while more commonly associated with cation-π interactions, can be designed for anion-π recognition by strategic placement of electron-deficient aromatic residues.', 'Anion-π binding is generally weaker than classical hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions, but can provide unique selectivity profiles, especially in competitive or aqueous environments.', 'Applications of anion-π binding hosts include sensing, separation, and catalysis, particularly in biochemistry and chemical biology, where selective recognition of biologically relevant anions is critical.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles, molecular tweezers, and aromatic cages are all subclasses of supramolecular hosts, but differ in their structural motifs and modes of anion recognition.', 'Macrocycles such as calixarenes and pillararenes are structurally related, both featuring cyclic arrays of aromatic units, but differ in ring size, conformational flexibility, and ease of functionalization.', 'Molecular tweezers are structurally distinct from macrocycles, offering a more open, cleft-like binding site, but can be functionally related through the use of aromatic π-surfaces for anion binding.', 'The effectiveness of anion-π interactions is closely tied to the electron deficiency of the aromatic surface, which can be modulated by chemical modification (e.g., sulfonation, nitration) of the host framework.', 'There is a significant overlap between hosts designed for cation-π and anion-π interactions, with selectivity determined by the electronic properties of the aromatic surfaces and the overall host architecture.']}
