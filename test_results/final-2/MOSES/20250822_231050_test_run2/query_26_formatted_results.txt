{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests predominantly through cation-π interactions are calixarenes (including sulfonatocalixarenes), cyclophanes, and pillararenes, with specific subclasses such as calix(n)arenes, sulfonatocalix(n)arenes, and cationic pillar(n)arenes exhibiting strong cation-π binding motifs.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes (including calix(4)arene, calix(6)arene, calix(8)arene, and their sulfonated derivatives such as p-sulfonatocalix(4)arene (SC4), SC6, SC8, and SCXn) possess hydrophobic cavities and electron-rich aromatic surfaces that facilitate strong cation-π interactions with cationic guests, particularly methylated lysine and trimethyllysine (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398, DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Cyclophanes, including their derivatives and subfamilies such as calix(n)arenes, act as synthetic receptors for organic guest molecules and alkylammonium ions, utilizing electron-rich aromatic rings to engage in cation-π interactions (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Pillararenes (notably pillar(5)arene, pillar(6)arene, pillar(7)arene, and their cationic/anionic derivatives) feature electron-rich cavities and are explicitly noted to bind amine groups via cation-π interactions, with high selectivity for methylated lysine and other cationic analytes (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cucurbiturils, while primarily recognized for high-affinity binding and molecular recognition of methylated lysine, are not explicitly described as relying primarily on cation-π interactions in the provided data, but rather on hydrophobic and ion-dipole interactions.', 'Crown ethers, although they complex cations (e.g., ammonium, trimethylammonium), do so mainly via ion-dipole interactions rather than cation-π interactions (DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).'], 'background_information': ['Calixarenes are macrocyclic hosts with adjustable size and shape, hydrophobic cavities, and electron-donor character, making them particularly effective for cation-π recognition of methylated amino acids and peptides. Their derivatization (e.g., sulfonation) enhances water solubility and selectivity for biological targets (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398, DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Pillararenes are macrocyclic, synthetic container molecules with electron-rich cavities, poor solubility in their native form, but can be functionalized for water solubility and selectivity. They are used for recognition of methylated lysine and exhibit high affinity for fluorescent indicators and analytes via cation-π interactions (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cyclophanes are synthetic container molecules, often water-soluble, with dissociation constants as low as 50 μM for certain guests. They are structurally related to calixarenes and are designed to mimic biological recognition sites, particularly for alkylammonium ions and acetylcholine, through cation-π interactions (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cucurbiturils are synthetic container molecules with hydrophobic interiors and high binding affinity for methylated lysine, but their primary binding mode is not cation-π interaction. They are used in catalysis, high-affinity binding, and molecular recognition (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Crown ethers are macrocyclic compounds with cation-complexing properties, binding ammonium cations and amine groups via ion-dipole interactions, not cation-π interactions (DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes, cyclophanes, and pillararenes all share the structural feature of electron-rich aromatic cavities, which is essential for cation-π interaction-based guest binding.', 'Calixarenes and pillararenes are both used for selective recognition of methylated lysine, a process that relies on cation-π interactions for discrimination between methylation states (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398, DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Cyclophanes are structurally related to calixarenes and share similar cation-π binding motifs, especially for alkylammonium ions and acetylcholine.', 'Cucurbiturils and crown ethers, while effective in cation binding, primarily utilize hydrophobic or ion-dipole interactions, respectively, and are not classified as cation-π interaction-dominant hosts in the provided data.', 'The selectivity and affinity of these hosts for cationic guests (e.g., methylated lysine, trimethyllysine, alkylammonium ions) are directly linked to the presence and arrangement of electron-rich aromatic surfaces within their macrocyclic frameworks.']}
