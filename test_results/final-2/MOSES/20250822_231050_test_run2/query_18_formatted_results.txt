{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind anions via anion-π interactions are electron-deficient macrocyclic hosts, especially cyclophanes (notably 2,6-helic[6]arene and its derivatives), calixarenes, foldamers, and molecular tweezers incorporating π-acidic aromatic surfaces.', 'key_points': ['Macrocyclic hosts such as cyclophanes (e.g., 2,6-helic[6]arene, 2,6-helix[6]arene, and their derivatives) are established supramolecular hosts for anion binding via anion-π interactions, due to their electron-deficient aromatic cavities.', 'Calixarenes, particularly sulfonatocalix[n]arenes (e.g., SCX4, SCXn_complex, SC4), are macrocyclic hosts with hydrophobic, π-rich cavities that can engage in anion-π interactions with various anions.', 'Foldamers, such as iodotriazole foldamers, possess folded, π-acidic aromatic surfaces and hydrophobic interiors, enabling selective anion binding through anion-π interactions.', 'Molecular tweezers, including carboxylate molecular tweezers and phosphate molecular tweezers, feature open-chain, semi-rigid, electron-deficient aromatic binding pockets that facilitate anion-π recognition.', 'Naphthalimide and perylene bisimide dye (PBI) derivatives, when incorporated into host frameworks, provide π-acidic surfaces capable of anion-π interactions, though their primary use is often in sensing rather than strong binding.', 'Macrocyclic hosts with π-acidic aromatic rings (e.g., triazine-based hosts, pillararene derivatives) are also implicated in anion-π binding, especially when functionalized to enhance electron deficiency.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are noncovalent interactions between an anion and the π-system of an electron-deficient aromatic ring, typically requiring a π-acidic (electron-poor) surface for effective binding.', 'Macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cyclophanes, calixarenes, pillararene derivatives) provide a preorganized, rigid, and hydrophobic cavity that can stabilize anions via anion-π interactions, often in competition with solvation and other noncovalent forces.', 'Foldamers and molecular tweezers are designed to present π-acidic surfaces in a spatially defined manner, enhancing selectivity and affinity for anionic guests through anion-π recognition.', 'The effectiveness of anion-π binding is influenced by the electron deficiency of the aromatic surface, the geometry and size of the host cavity, and the solvation/desolvation properties of the target anion (e.g., as ranked by the Hofmeister series).', 'Water-soluble derivatives of macrocyclic hosts (e.g., sulfonatocalix[4]arene, SCX4) are particularly relevant for anion-π binding in aqueous environments, where competition with hydration is significant.', 'Anion-π interactions are often studied using NMR titration experiments and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to quantify binding affinities and thermodynamic parameters.'], 'relationships': ['Cyclophanes (e.g., 2,6-helic[6]arene) and their derivatives are direct descendants of both the macrocyclic host and cyclophane classes, and are specifically listed as anion receptors, highlighting their central role in anion-π binding.', 'Calixarenes (e.g., SCX4, SCXn_complex, SC4) are both macrocyclic hosts and calixarene derivatives, and are structurally related to cyclophanes, further supporting their function as anion-π hosts.', 'Foldamers (e.g., iodotriazole foldamer) are classified as foldamer descendants and are explicitly noted for enabling anion binding, with structural features (π-acidic aromatic units, hydrophobic interiors) that promote anion-π interactions.', 'Molecular tweezers (e.g., carboxylate molecular tweezer, phosphate molecular tweezer) are acyclic receptors with open, π-acidic binding sites, and are listed as descendants of both the acyclic receptor and molecular tweezer classes, indicating their relevance for anion-π recognition.', 'Naphthalimide and perylene bisimide dye (PBI) units, while primarily used for sensing, are incorporated into host frameworks to provide π-acidic surfaces for anion-π interactions, and are structurally related to macrocyclic and acyclic host classes.', 'The presence of electron-deficient aromatic rings, hydrophobic cavities, and rigid preorganization are recurring structural motifs across all host types that facilitate anion-π binding.']}
