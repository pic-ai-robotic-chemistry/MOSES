{'summary': 'Macrocycles encompass a diverse class of large, ring-shaped molecules, including calixarenes, cyclophanes, cyclodextrins, porphyrins, crown ethers, and cryptands, each with distinct structural and functional properties. Specific examples include calixarene_1, cyclophane_1a, beta_cyclodextrin, porphyrin_tweezer_system, tetrasulfonated_crown_ether, and calix(6)aza-cryptand, among others.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes: calixarene_1, calixarene_6, calixarene_14—exhibit high selectivity and affinity for methylated lysine residues (e.g., trimethyllysine), with dissociation constants such as 28 μM for cytochrome_c complexes and selectivity ratios up to 150 (trimethyllysine) (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398). Calixarene_14 is used in supramolecular affinity chromatography and is linked to agarose beads.', 'Cyclophanes: cyclophane_1a, disulfide_cyclophane, cyclophane_monoamine, fluorophore_appended_cyclophane—feature aromatic units (e.g., phenylene, benzene, naphthalene rings), synthetic receptor properties, and are used for protein sensing and recognition of methylated lysine. Cyclophane_1a demonstrates binding affinities of 1.5e5 M^-1 for myoglobin and 4.3e3–8.1e3 M^-1 for fluorescent probes (DOI: 10.1007/s10847-015-0546-3).', 'Cyclodextrins: beta_cyclodextrin, alpha_cyclodextrin, cyclodextrin_3—characterized by cyclic oligosaccharide structures with variable cavity sizes (e.g., large for beta_cyclodextrin), capable of self-assembly, and functionalized with alkyl groups (octyl, dodecyl). Alpha_cyclodextrin forms complexes with peptides and modulates dissociation and charge states (DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429). Cyclodextrin_3 contains hydrogen-bond donor groups and exhibits weaker binding than per-methylated analogs (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Porphyrin-based macrocycles: porphyrin_tweezer_system, metal_porphyrin, zn-porphyrin_capsule—include rigid linkers, increased Lewis acidity, and D4h symmetry. Zn-porphyrin_capsule is used in 1:1 acetonitrile:water solvent systems (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'Crown ethers: tetrasulfonated_crown_ether—macrocyclic polyethers with sulfonate groups, used for cation binding and molecular recognition.', 'Cryptands: calix(6)aza-cryptand—affects binding of neutral versus anionic guests (DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02541).', 'Macrocycle_33, macrocycle_37, macrocycle_9—synthetic macrocycles generated by dynamic combinatorial library (DCL) approaches, with selectivity values of 8.1–35 and carboxylate function counts of 2. Macrocycle_9 is synthesized from anthracenyl_diamine and isophthaloyl_spacer, exhibiting exceptionally high binding affinity for squaraine dye (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles are defined by their large, cyclic molecular frameworks, which enable unique host–guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and selective binding of ions, peptides, and small molecules.', 'Calixarenes are phenolic macrocycles with tunable cavity sizes and functional groups, widely used in molecular recognition, protein binding, and as affinity chromatography media.', 'Cyclophanes are macrocycles containing aromatic units linked by aliphatic or heteroatom bridges, notable for their rigid, preorganized structures and applications in supramolecular chemistry and sensing.', 'Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma forms) with hydrophobic cavities, enabling inclusion complex formation with a variety of guest molecules. Functionalization (e.g., alkylation) modulates their self-assembly and binding properties.', 'Porphyrins and metalloporphyrins are macrocycles with conjugated tetrapyrrole rings, central to biological processes (e.g., heme, chlorophyll) and synthetic host–guest systems. Rigid linkers and metalation alter their electronic and binding properties.', 'Crown ethers are macrocyclic polyethers that selectively bind cations via their electron-rich cavities, with sulfonated derivatives enhancing water solubility and selectivity.', 'Cryptands are three-dimensional, bicyclic or polycyclic macrocycles that encapsulate ions or molecules, providing high selectivity for guest binding.', 'Dynamic combinatorial library (DCL) approaches enable the generation of diverse synthetic macrocycles with tailored selectivity and binding properties, as exemplified by macrocycle_33 and macrocycle_37.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes, cyclophanes, cyclodextrins, porphyrins, crown ethers, and cryptands represent structurally and functionally distinct families of macrocycles, each with characteristic host–guest chemistry.', 'Functionalization (e.g., sulfonation, alkylation, conjugation with fluorophores or agarose beads) modulates the selectivity, affinity, and application of macrocycles in molecular recognition and sensing.', 'Macrocycles such as calixarene_1 and calixarene_6 show high selectivity for methylated lysine residues, relevant for epigenetic studies and protein interaction analysis.', 'Cyclophane derivatives are used for protein sensing, with fluorescence changes upon binding to various proteins (e.g., myoglobin, albumins, lysozyme).', "Cyclodextrins' cavity size and functionalization determine their guest binding specificity and self-assembly behavior.", "Porphyrin-based macrocycles' electronic properties and guest binding are influenced by linker rigidity and metalation state.", 'Dynamic combinatorial library (DCL) synthesis enables the discovery of macrocycles with specific selectivity and binding profiles, as demonstrated by macrocycle_33 and macrocycle_37.']}
