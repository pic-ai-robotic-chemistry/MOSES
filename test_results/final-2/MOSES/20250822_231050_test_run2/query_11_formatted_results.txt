{'summary': 'A cryptand is a macrobicyclic ligand that encapsulates guest molecules, functioning as a host in host-guest chemistry and often used in supramolecular chemistry for selective molecular recognition.', 'key_points': ['Cryptands are a class of macrobicyclic ligands specifically designed to encapsulate guest molecules, particularly in host-guest chemistry contexts.', 'Cryptands are macrocyclic compounds that can be functionalized with anthracene dye or naphthalimide dye, enabling selectivity for specific anions such as sulfate.', "The property 'is_functionalized_with' specifies that cryptands may incorporate anthracene dye or naphthalimide dye as functional groups (union(anthracene_dye, naphthalimide_dye)).", "The property 'has_guest' indicates that cryptands are capable of encapsulating organic guest molecules (single(organic_guest)), as referenced in 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429.", "Cryptands are classified as both 'macrobicyclic_ligand' and 'receptor', reflecting their dual role in molecular encapsulation and selective molecular recognition."], 'background_information': ['Cryptands are central to the field of supramolecular chemistry, where they serve as host molecules in host-guest systems, facilitating the study of molecular recognition and selective binding.', 'Functionalization with specific dyes (anthracene, naphthalimide) is used to tune the selectivity and sensing capabilities of cryptands, particularly for anion recognition such as sulfate.', 'The encapsulation ability of cryptands is structurally enabled by their macrobicyclic framework, which provides a preorganized cavity for guest binding.', 'Cryptands are related to other macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers, but are distinguished by their three-dimensional, bicyclic structure that enhances guest encapsulation and selectivity.', 'The formation of a cryptate refers to the complex formed when a cryptand encapsulates a guest ion or molecule.'], 'relationships': ['Cryptands are a subclass of macrobicyclic_ligand (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429) and receptor, indicating their structural and functional roles.', 'The functionalization of cryptands with anthracene dye or naphthalimide dye is directly linked to their selectivity for specific anions, such as sulfate.', 'The host-guest relationship is explicit: cryptands (host) encapsulate organic guest molecules (guest), forming cryptates.', 'Cryptands are conceptually and functionally related to crown ethers, but provide enhanced encapsulation due to their macrobicyclic (bicyclic) architecture.']}
