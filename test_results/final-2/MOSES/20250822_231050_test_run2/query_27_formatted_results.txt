{'summary': 'The main factors controlling host-guest interaction are the interplay of non-covalent interactions (hydrophobic effect, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, and π-π stacking), molecular complementarity (size, shape, and surface), solvent effects, and thermodynamic parameters, all modulated by the chemical environment and functional group composition of host and guest.', 'key_points': ['Non-covalent interactions are the primary forces governing host-guest interaction, including hydrophobic effect (classical and non-classical), hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, electrostatic attraction/repulsion, ion-dipole and dipole-dipole interactions, and π-π stacking.', 'Hydrophobic effect: A major driving force for molecular association in aqueous solution, with classical hydrophobic effect providing favorable entropic compensation (release of surface-bound solvent molecules) and non-classical hydrophobic effect providing favorable enthalpic gain (release of high-energy water from host cavity). The hydrophobic effect is influenced by molecular shape and is complemented by ion-dipole interactions.', 'Hydrogen bonding: Critical for selectivity and stabilization of host-guest complexes, with hydrogen bond distances in the range of 2.508–2.968 Å. Hydrogen bonds are formed between specific donor and acceptor sites (e.g., pyridine NH binding site and carbonyl oxygen atom) and are validated by atoms-in-molecules and reduced density gradient analyses.', 'Van der Waals interactions: Weak intermolecular forces that are most relevant for selectivity, especially in hosts with polarizable, saturated nonpolar pockets. They contribute to favorable enthalpy changes and stabilization of inclusion complexes.', 'Electrostatic interactions: Include both attraction (primary driving force for binding strength, e.g., between sulfonate groups and organic cations) and repulsion (can be diminished by greater distance, leading to more stable binding). Electrostatic interactions are extremely sensitive to the environment and can be overwhelmed by other forces (e.g., high-energy water release).', 'Molecular complementarity: Size, shape, and surface complementarity between host and guest are essential for strong binding. Spherical shape complementarity can override other non-covalent forces such as π-stacking and hydrophobic interactions.', 'Solvent effects: The solvent environment (e.g., water, D2O, organic solvents) significantly influences host-guest interaction strength and selectivity. Solvent effects are evaluated using models such as the polarizable continuum model (PCM) and can weaken or enhance binding depending on polarity and solvation thermodynamics.', 'Thermodynamic parameters: Host-guest interactions are characterized by enthalpy change (ΔH), entropy change (ΔS), binding free energy (ΔG), and association constant (Ka). The process is studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), NMR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations.', 'Functional group effects: Introduction and positioning of functional groups (e.g., anionic, imidazole) on host or guest modulate binding properties, selectivity, and reactivity. Functional groups can be introduced at specific positions (meso, beta) to fine-tune host-guest recognition.', 'Desolvation: The removal of solvent from the host cavity and guest is a key step in complex formation, contributing to the overall thermodynamics of binding.', 'Cooperativity: The interplay between classical and non-classical hydrophobic effects, as well as other non-covalent interactions, can be tuned to control positive or negative cooperativity in binding.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest interaction is a subclass of molecular recognition and supramolecular chemistry, involving the non-covalent binding of a host molecule (often a macrocyclic compound such as cucurbituril, cyclodextrin, or calixarene) and a guest molecule (e.g., amino acid, peptide, small organic molecule).', 'Supramolecular chemistry focuses on the study of non-covalent interactions and assemblies, with host-guest chemistry as a key subfield. Applications include drug delivery, catalysis, nanotechnology, and biosensing.', 'Molecular recognition is governed by weak interactions and is influenced by cavity size, conformational rigidity, and substitution patterns on the host. Recognition efficiency can reach 55% in optimized systems.', 'Hydrophobic effect is a non-classical, enthalpy-driven phenomenon in water, attributed to the selective binding and stability of molecular complexes. It is modeled by synthetic receptors and membranes, and is illustrated by guest binding data (e.g., Table 3, 10.1021/ja0727058).', 'Electrostatic interactions are evaluated by DFT calculations and are significant for guest location within the host cavity. They are less relevant for selectivity compared to van der Waals forces but are primary drivers for binding strength.', 'Hydrogen bonding is most relevant for selectivity and stabilization, with bond lengths typically in the range of 2.5–3.0 Å. Hydrogen bonds stabilize specific conformations (e.g., vase conformation) and are validated by computational analyses.', 'Solvent effects are critical in modulating host-guest interactions, with water often enhancing hydrophobic effects and organic solvents weakening them. Solvent grade, drying, and distillation procedures are important experimental considerations.', 'Functional group introduction is a required chemical synthetic procedure for tuning host-guest systems, with anionic functional groups (e.g., phosphate, sulfate) showing a stability trend: O-methylenecarboxylate < phosphonate < sulfate < phosphate.', 'Shape and surface complementarity are quantified by volume occupancy (e.g., 55% for long-chain hydrocarbons) and are essential for strong binding in both biological and synthetic systems.', 'Host-guest interactions are studied by a range of techniques: NMR (1H, 2D NOESY), ITC, UV-Vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, ESI-MS, molecular dynamics simulation, and quantum chemical calculations.'], 'relationships': ['Non-covalent interactions (hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, electrostatic, π-π stacking) act synergistically to determine host-guest binding strength and selectivity.', 'Classical hydrophobic effect dominates negative cooperativity and is essential in the initial binding step, while non-classical hydrophobic effect explains positive cooperativity and can outweigh the classical effect in systems with higher hydrophilicity.', 'Spherical shape complementarity can override hydrophobic and π-stacking interactions, highlighting the importance of geometric fit.', 'Electrostatic attraction is the primary driving force for binding strength, especially between oppositely charged groups, but can be counterbalanced by cation-π interactions or diminished by increased distance.', 'Desolvation of both host cavity and guest is a prerequisite for inclusion and contributes to the enthalpic and entropic profile of binding.', 'Functional group introduction and positioning modulate binding properties and selectivity, with specific groups (e.g., imidazole) interacting with host features (e.g., Zn-porphyrin capsule wall).', 'Solvent effects are evaluated and can either weaken (e.g., in organic solvents) or enhance (e.g., in water) host-guest interactions, influencing the overall thermodynamics and selectivity.', 'Thermodynamic parameters (ΔH, ΔS, ΔG, Ka) are interdependent and collectively define the favorability and mechanism of host-guest complexation.', 'Cooperativity in binding can be rationally controlled by tuning the interplay of hydrophobic effects and other non-covalent interactions.']}
