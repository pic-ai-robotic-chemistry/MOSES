{'summary': 'Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid derived from cinchona tree bark, primarily used as an antimalarial agent and for other medical and analytical applications. It exhibits low solubility in water, is typically dissolved in ethanol for stock solutions, and is associated with specific adverse health effects and distinct analytical detection methods.', 'key_points': ['Quinine is classified as an alkaloid and is a component of cinchona tree bark.', 'It is primarily used for the treatment of malaria, but also for lupus, arthritis, muscle cramp, and as a bittering agent.', 'Quinine exhibits low solubility in water and is hydrophobic; it is commonly dissolved in ethanol for stock solutions at a concentration of 10 mM.', 'Stock solutions of quinine are often diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS).', 'Quinine can induce adverse health effects including thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, blindness, and acute kidney injury.', 'Analytical detection and quantification of quinine utilize methods such as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), electrochemical techniques, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), colorimetric assay, fluorescence assay, and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).', 'Quinine is detected by quantitative electrochemical methods, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), and electrochemiluminescence biosensors.', 'In detection schemes, quinine serves as the target analyte.', 'A 1:1 molar ratio with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is noted in complexation studies.', 'Proton NMR analysis of quinine may show a slight proton peak shift.', 'Reported recovery rates for quinine in analytical methods range from 98.3% to 109.3%.', 'Typical incubation time in certain analytical protocols is 40 minutes.'], 'background_information': ["Quinine's role as a bittering agent is significant in the food and beverage industry, particularly in tonic water.", 'Its hydrophobic nature and low aqueous solubility necessitate the use of organic solvents such as ethanol for preparation of concentrated solutions.', 'The use of phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for dilution is standard in analytical and biochemical assays to maintain pH and ionic strength.', 'Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and other electrochemical techniques provide sensitive and selective detection of quinine, often in complex matrices.', 'High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) are employed for precise quantification and structural analysis.', "Fluorescence and colorimetric assays exploit quinine's intrinsic optical properties for detection.", 'The adverse health effects associated with quinine, such as thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury, are clinically significant and limit its use in some populations.', "Complexation with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) can enhance quinine's solubility and stability, which is relevant for pharmaceutical formulation and analytical chemistry."], 'relationships': ["Quinine's alkaloid structure and origin from cinchona tree bark underpin its pharmacological and analytical properties.", 'Its hydrophobicity and low water solubility dictate the use of ethanol as a solvent and PBS as a diluent in laboratory protocols.', 'The range of analytical techniques (DPV, HPLC, HRMS, fluorescence, colorimetric assays) reflects the need for sensitive, selective, and quantitative detection of quinine in diverse matrices.', 'Adverse health effects are directly related to quinine exposure and are critical considerations in therapeutic and analytical contexts.', 'The 1:1 molar ratio with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) indicates a specific host-guest interaction, relevant for solubility enhancement and analytical applications.', "A slight proton peak shift in NMR analysis suggests specific interactions or environmental changes around quinine's protons, useful for structural elucidation."]}
