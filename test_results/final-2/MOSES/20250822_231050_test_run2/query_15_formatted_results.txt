{'summary': 'When a calixarene containing pyrrole groups binds an anion, the primary non-covalent interactions involved are hydrogen bonding (notably via pyrrole NH groups), electrostatic interactions, and anion–π interactions, all within the context of host–guest molecular recognition.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonding is the most relevant and influential non-covalent interaction in anion binding by calixarenes containing pyrrole groups, with hydrogen bond distances typically in the range of 2.508–2.968 Å (10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Pyrrole NH groups act as hydrogen bond donors to the anion, facilitating strong and directional hydrogen bonding interactions.', 'Electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged anion and the electron-rich regions of the calixarene (including pyrrole and phenolic units) contribute to binding, with electrostatic attraction identified as a primary driving force for molecular recognition (10.1021/jo502825z).', 'Anion–π interactions may occur between the anion and the π-system of the pyrrole or aromatic rings in the calixarene scaffold, further stabilizing the complex.', 'The hydrophobic cavity of calixarene provides a preorganized environment that enables and enhances these non-covalent interactions, particularly by facilitating hydrophobic effects and spatially organizing binding sites.', 'Anion binding is also enabled by hydrophobic concavity and can be mediated by sigma-hole interactions, as supported by molecular dynamics simulations (10.1021/jacs.9b00148).'], 'background_information': ['Calixarenes are macrocyclic synthetic receptors with a hydrophobic cavity and are fully addressable and easily modifiable, allowing for the incorporation of functional groups such as pyrrole to tailor binding properties (10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Hydrogen bonding is among the strongest and most influential intermolecular forces in supramolecular chemistry, playing a significant role in molecular recognition and host–guest chemistry, but its strength can be attenuated in water (10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Electrostatic interactions are extremely sensitive to the environment and can be overwhelmed or modulated by solvent effects and entropic factors (10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004; 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Anion binding by calixarene-based receptors is often studied using molecular dynamics simulations and is influenced by the hydrophobic effect, ion–dipole interactions, and the presence of sigma-holes (10.1021/jacs.9b00148; 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Host–guest chemistry and molecular recognition are governed by weak interactions, with the goal of forming stable host–guest complexes; the process is influenced by cavity size, conformation, and the nature of substituents on the macrocycle (10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Hydrogen bonding in these systems is validated by atoms-in-molecules analysis and reduced density gradients analysis (10.1039/C7SC04989G).'], 'relationships': ['Hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and anion–π interactions act cooperatively to stabilize the anion–calixarene complex, with the hydrophobic cavity preorganizing the binding site for optimal interaction.', 'The presence of pyrrole groups in calixarene increases the number and strength of hydrogen bond donors, enhancing anion binding selectivity and affinity.', 'Electrostatic attraction is the primary driving force for molecular recognition in these host–guest systems, but its contribution is modulated by solvent and entropic effects.', 'Anion–π interactions provide additional stabilization, especially when the anion is positioned above the π-system of the pyrrole or aromatic rings.', 'The overall binding process is a specialization of supramolecular chemistry, realized through macrocyclic compounds and governed by weak, non-covalent interactions.']}
