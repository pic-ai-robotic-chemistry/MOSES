{'summary': 'An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) consists of a host (receptor), an indicator (dye), and an analyte, operating via competitive binding in a supramolecular context to detect specific target molecules through indicator displacement.', 'key_points': ['Essential components of an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) include: a host (receptor), an indicator (dye), and an analyte.', 'Specific hosts used in IDAs include carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene (WP6) and deep_cavitand.', 'Indicators employed in IDAs include safranine_T (ST), lucigenin, and dye_28.', 'The assay operates on the principle of competitive binding: the indicator forms a complex with the host, which is then displaced by the analyte, resulting in a measurable signal change.', 'IDAs are applied for the detection of specific analytes such as caffeine and trimethylated_lysine.', 'Assay locations include lipid membrane constructs and living cells (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assays are a class of supramolecular analytical techniques that exploit host-guest chemistry for selective analyte detection.', 'The selectivity of the assay can be tuned by the choice of host and indicator; for example, deep_cavitand as a recognition element provides selectivity for trimethylated_lysine (DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F).', 'The displacement of the indicator by the analyte is typically monitored via optical changes (e.g., fluorescence or absorbance) associated with the indicator.', 'IDAs have been specifically applied to caffeine sensing and detection of post-translational modifications such as trimethylated_lysine.', 'The use of supramolecular hosts such as carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene (WP6) and deep_cavitand enables high specificity and tunable binding affinities.'], 'relationships': ['The host (e.g., carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene, deep_cavitand) forms a non-covalent complex with the indicator (e.g., safranine_T, lucigenin, dye_28); introduction of the analyte leads to competitive displacement of the indicator.', 'The choice of host and indicator directly determines the selectivity and sensitivity of the IDA for a given analyte (e.g., caffeine, trimethylated_lysine).', 'Assay performance and applicability are influenced by the assay environment, with demonstrated operation in lipid membrane constructs and living cells.', 'The IDA framework is extensible to a variety of analytes by appropriate selection of host-guest pairs and indicators, as evidenced by applications in caffeine sensing and detection of trimethylated_lysine.']}
