{'summary': 'An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular analytical technique in which an indicator dye, initially bound to a host molecule (receptor), is displaced by an analyte (guest), resulting in a measurable signal that enables detection and quantification of the analyte.', 'key_points': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a sensing method where a dye (indicator) is displaced from a host molecule by an analyte, producing a measurable signal.', 'The host molecule (receptor) forms a complex with an indicator dye; upon introduction of a guest (analyte), the dye is displaced due to competitive binding, and this displacement is detected optically (e.g., fluorescence, absorbance).', 'IDA is applied for ultrasensitive fluorescence detection of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in aqueous media and is compatible with live cell assays.', 'Indicator dyes used in IDA include lucigenin and dye_28; host molecules include carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene (WP6), safranine T (ST), deep cavitand, beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), poly(N-acetylaniline), and graphene.', 'IDA is selective for specific analytes, such as caffeine and trimethylated lysine, and can be used for caffeine sensing and detection of post-translational modifications in proteins.', 'The interaction type in IDA is non-covalent, and the assay can be performed in lipid membrane constructs and living cells.', 'IDA is compatible with differential sensing strategies, allowing construction of sensor arrays by combining multiple receptors and indicators.'], 'background_information': ['IDA is a subclass of pattern-based sensing and reporting element methodologies, and is a technique within supramolecular analytical chemistry and molecular recognition.', 'IDA is often coupled with differential sensing, which enables ultrasensitive and specific detection of analytes such as LPA (lysophosphatidic acid) and hypoxia markers.', 'The assay is performed in various biological locations, including inside live cells and lipid membrane constructs, and is suitable for optical sensing applications.', 'IDA arrays can be constructed for multiplexed detection by combining multiple synthetic receptors and indicators, enhancing compatibility with differential sensing approaches.', 'IDA is used to measure the affinity of host-guest complexes under different conditions, providing quantitative information about molecular interactions.', 'The sensing targets of IDA include analytes, metal cations, anions, drugs, and biological molecules.', 'IDA is a non-covalent, reversible, and modular approach, making it suitable for real-time and in situ monitoring in complex biological environments.'], 'relationships': ['IDA involves a competitive binding equilibrium between the host (receptor), indicator dye, and analyte (guest), where the analyte displaces the indicator from the host.', 'The measurable signal generated by dye displacement is typically optical (fluorescence or absorbance), and the magnitude of the signal correlates with analyte concentration.', 'IDA is applied for caffeine sensing and detection of trimethylated lysine, demonstrating selectivity for specific molecular targets.', 'Host molecules such as deep cavitand, carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene (WP6), and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) serve as recognition elements, while indicator dyes such as lucigenin and dye_28 provide the optical signal.', 'IDA is integrated with differential sensing strategies, enabling the construction of sensor arrays for multiplexed analyte detection (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'IDA is a technique of supramolecular analytical chemistry and is used in optical sensing applications, including live cell and lipid membrane environments.']}
