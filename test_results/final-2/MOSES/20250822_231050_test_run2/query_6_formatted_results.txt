{'summary': 'The principal host molecules used for host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays are macrocyclic hosts, specifically cyclodextrins (notably β-cyclodextrin), cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8, and their homologues/derivatives), and calixarenes (including sulfonatocalixarenes and their derivatives).', 'key_points': ['Cyclodextrins (CDs), especially β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), are widely used as host molecules in electrochemical assays employing host-guest recognition. β-CD forms inclusion complexes with guest molecules such as methylene blue (MB) and quinine, and is integrated into electrochemical sensors and sensing platforms for analyte detection (e.g., quinine, tryptophan).', 'Cucurbiturils, particularly cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), cucurbit[8]uril (CB8), and their homologues (CB(n), Q(n)), are established host molecules in electrochemical host-guest assays. CB7 and CB8 form strong inclusion complexes with a range of guests (e.g., amino acids, peptides, methylene blue, tripeptides) and are used in indicator displacement assays (IDA) and electrochemical sensors for analyte quantification (e.g., tryptophan, quinine).', 'Calixarenes, including sulfonatocalix(n)arenes (e.g., SC4, SCX4) and their derivatives, are employed as host molecules in electrochemical host-guest systems. These macrocycles form complexes with various guests (e.g., amines, drugs, peptides) and are used in sensor applications, including fluorescent and electrochemical sensing platforms.', 'Host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays is typically realized via non-covalent interactions (hydrophobic, ion-dipole, hydrogen bonding, π-π, cation-π), with host molecules providing a hydrophobic cavity for guest encapsulation. The resulting host-guest complexes are characterized by high binding affinities (association constants up to 10^12 M^-1 for cucurbiturils), selectivity, and tunable properties via host derivatization.', 'Electrochemical sensors and sensing platforms based on host-guest recognition are constructed using macrocyclic hosts (β-CD, CB7, CB8, calixarenes) integrated with nanocomposites, glassy carbon electrodes, or other conductive materials. Detection is achieved via techniques such as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).', 'Host-guest recognition is central to indicator displacement assays (IDA) in electrochemical sensing, where a competitive guest displaces an indicator (e.g., MB) from the host, modulating the electrochemical signal for analyte quantification.'], 'background_information': ['Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides with a hydrophobic inner cavity and hydrophilic exterior, capable of forming inclusion complexes with a wide range of guest molecules (amino acids, peptides, dyes, drugs). β-CD is the most commonly used CD in electrochemical host-guest assays due to its optimal cavity size and commercial availability. CDs are driven by hydrophobic effects and hydrogen bonding, and their binding affinities for hydrophobic amino acids (e.g., phenylalanine) are well-documented (affinity range: 1.6–5.7 kcal mol^-1 for anions). CDs are also used as recognition motifs in molecular sensing platforms and can be covalently linked to fluorescent probes to enhance detection sensitivity.', 'Cucurbiturils (CBs, Q(n)) are synthetic macrocyclic hosts composed of glycoluril units linked by methylene bridges, with rigid, hydrophobic cavities and polar carbonyl-laced portals. CB7 and CB8 are the most relevant homologues for electrochemical host-guest assays, exhibiting high water solubility, strong binding affinities (association constants up to 10^12 M^-1 for amines), and selectivity for cationic and aromatic guests. CB7 and CB8 form 1:1 or 2:1 inclusion complexes with guests such as methylene blue, tripeptides, and amino acids, and are used in indicator displacement assays (F-IDA, E-IDA) and electrochemical sensors for analyte detection (e.g., tryptophan, quinine). CB-based assemblies can be integrated into nanomaterials and biomacromolecular assemblies for biosensing and therapeutic applications.', 'Calixarenes are macrocyclic phenolic compounds with tunable cavity sizes and functionalizable upper/lower rims, allowing for water solubility and selective guest binding. Sulfonatocalixarenes (e.g., SC4, SCX4) and their derivatives are used as hosts in electrochemical and fluorescent sensing systems, forming complexes with amines, drugs, peptides, and neurotransmitters. Calixarene derivatives can be tailored for enhanced water solubility, selectivity (e.g., for trimethyllysine), and sensor integration. Calixarene-based dimers and affinity reagents are also used in biological fluids and affinity chromatography.', 'Host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays is characterized by non-covalent interactions: hydrophobic, ion-dipole, hydrogen bonding, π-π, cation-π, and size/shape complementarity. The formation of host-guest complexes is confirmed by techniques such as NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Electrochemical detection is achieved via DPV, CV, EIS, and is often coupled with nanocomposite materials (e.g., polyaniline, reduced graphene oxide) for signal enhancement.', 'Host-guest systems in electrochemical assays exhibit high selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and reusability. For example, β-CD-based sensors display negligible interference from common ions and biomolecules, high signal retention (86.47% over 21 days), and low relative standard deviation (2.06% across seven electrodes). CB8-based sensors have been used for tryptophan detection in real samples, and calixarene-based systems for drug and neurotransmitter sensing.', 'Macrocyclic host molecules (CDs, CBs, calixarenes) are fully addressable, easily derivatized, and can be integrated into multivalent or nanostructured platforms for advanced molecular recognition and sensing applications. Their use in electrochemical assays is a direct application of supramolecular chemistry principles, leveraging non-covalent host-guest interactions for selective, sensitive, and robust analyte detection.'], 'relationships': ['β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) forms host-guest complexes with methylene blue (MB) and quinine, enabling their use in electrochemical sensors and indicator displacement assays (IDA) for analyte quantification via DPV and CV.', 'Cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) and cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) form strong inclusion complexes with amino acids, peptides, and dyes (e.g., MB), and are used in electrochemical sensors for tryptophan and quinine detection.
