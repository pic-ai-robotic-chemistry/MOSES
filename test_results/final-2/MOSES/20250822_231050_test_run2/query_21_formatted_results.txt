{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) can detect a broad spectrum of molecular targets, including anions, metal ions, small molecules, small organic molecules, and biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and metabolites.', 'key_points': ['IDAs detect analytes by displacement of an indicator dye from a host molecule, resulting in a measurable signal (e.g., fluorescence, optical change).', 'Molecular types detected by IDA include: anions (e.g., sulfate, oxalate, halides, perchlorate, perrhenate, phosphate, thiocyanate, oxalate, acetate, bicarbonate, PF6-, SCN-, ClO4-, ReO4-, I-, F-, Br-, Cl-, SO4^2-, HCO3-, oxoanions, chaotropic anions, polarizable anions, Hofmeister series anions), metal ions (e.g., Cu(II), Fe(III)), small molecules (e.g., benzene, acetylcholine, betaine, choline, butyrylcholine, caffeine), small organic molecules (e.g., amino acids, peptides, post-translationally modified residues, drugs), and biomolecules (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, metabolites, histones, insulin, enzymes, antibodies).', 'Specific examples of detected analytes include trimethylated lysine, L-tryptophan, acetylated histone H4Kac, AR-Kme_1-STGGK, AR-Kme_2-STGGK, AR-Kme_3-STGGK, PATGGV-Kme_1-KPHRY, PATGGV-Kme_2-KPHRY, PATGGV-Kme_3-KPHRY, and various amino acids (L-arginine, L-histidine, L-lysine, L-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan, etc.).', 'IDAs are capable of detecting analytes in complex environments, including live cells, lipid membrane constructs, aqueous solutions, and lipid environments.', 'Detection is not limited to a single class; IDAs can be tailored for selective or broad-spectrum detection by varying the host, indicator, and recognition element (e.g., deep cavitand, calixarene, beta-cyclodextrin, synthetic receptor).', 'Quantitative parameters for analyte detection include association constants (e.g., 2.0 Ã— 10^2), binding models (e.g., 1:1 host-guest), and experimental conditions (e.g., 95% water/5% deuterium oxide, pH 1).'], 'background_information': ['IDAs are analytical techniques in which a host molecule binds an indicator dye; displacement of the dye by an analyte (guest) produces a measurable signal, often optical or fluorescent.', 'IDAs are widely used for the detection of post-translational modifications in proteins, small molecule drugs, and biologically relevant ions.', 'The selectivity and sensitivity of IDAs can be enhanced by coupling with differential sensing strategies, enabling discrimination among closely related analytes (e.g., methylation states of lysine).', 'Host molecules used in IDAs include macrocyclic receptors such as calixarenes, cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, pillararenes, and deep cavitands, which provide specific binding sites for target analytes.', 'Anions detected by IDA are often ranked by the Hofmeister series, with binding influenced by solvation, hydration, and polarizability; large, weakly hydrated anions (e.g., I-, ReO4-) are bound with high affinity (10^3 M^-1 in CH3CN).', 'Metal ion detection by IDA depends on the Lewis acidity and coordination environment of the metal ion, with binding constants described as moderate in competitive aqueous media.', 'Biomolecule detection includes proteins (e.g., insulin, hemoglobin, lysozyme), nucleic acids (DNA, RNA), peptides, and post-translationally modified residues (e.g., methylated lysine, acetylated histone).', 'Small molecule detection includes neurotransmitters (acetylcholine), drugs (doxorubicin, methotrexate), and metabolites (glucose, GABA).', 'IDAs can be performed in live cells, lipid membranes, and aqueous solutions, demonstrating versatility for biological and environmental sensing applications.', 'Detection is based on non-covalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrophobic effects) between the host, indicator, and analyte.'], 'relationships': ['IDAs operate via competitive binding: the analyte displaces the indicator from the host, with the resulting signal proportional to analyte concentration.', "Host-guest chemistry underpins IDA selectivity: the host's structure (e.g., deep cavitand, calixarene) determines which analytes can be detected based on size, charge, and functional group complementarity.", 'Anion detection is influenced by the Hofmeister series, solvation energy, and hydration shell properties; large, polarizable anions are more readily detected due to weaker solvation and higher affinity for hydrophobic or nonpolar host sites (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Metal ion detection is modulated by the first coordination sphere and competition with solvent molecules (DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02541).', "Biomolecule and small molecule detection is enabled by the host's ability to recognize specific post-translational modifications, side chains, or molecular motifs.", 'Differential sensing arrays using multiple hosts and indicators expand the range and specificity of detectable analytes, allowing for pattern-based recognition of complex mixtures.', 'Quantitative detection is governed by association constants, binding models (e.g., 1:1), and experimental conditions (e.g., solvent composition, pH).']}
