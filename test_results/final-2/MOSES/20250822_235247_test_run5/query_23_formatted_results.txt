{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) using optical detection can be designed utilizing a range of host-guest interactions, including hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and metal-ligand coordination, all of which are central to supramolecular chemistry and molecular recognition.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonding: Occurs in organic media and aqueous environments, mediated by functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, and pyridine dicarboxamide; attenuated by water; involved in amphiphilic cavities and clefts; plays a role in molecular recognition (has_hydrogen_bonding_partner: carbonyl, pyridine_dicarboxamide; is_deployed_in: amphiphilic_cavity, amphiphilic_cleft).', 'π-π stacking: Although not detailed in the data, π-π stacking is a recognized non-covalent interaction in supramolecular host-guest systems and can contribute to optical signal changes in IDAs.', 'Electrostatic interactions: Non-covalent forces between charged groups (e.g., between sulfonate and lysine residues, or carboxylate and cationic side chains); significant for guest recognition and selectivity; can be evaluated by DFT calculations; extremely sensitive to environment (sensitivity_to_environment: extremely sensitive, DOI:10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004); can be a driving force for guest location (electrostatic_interaction_role: driving_force_for_guest_location, DOI:10.1002/chem.201605394); involved in binding events with calixarenes, methylated lysine, sulfonato groups, and sulfate anions.', 'Hydrophobic interactions: Occur between alkyl chains and within cavities; affected by chain extension and Hofmeister salt ions; involved in the stabilization of host-guest complexes, especially with aromatic and dianionic guests and positively charged hosts.', 'Metal-ligand coordination: Recognized as a host-guest interaction type in supramolecular chemistry, though specific details are not provided in the current data.', 'Molecular recognition: Driven by hydrophobic effect, ion-dipole interaction, and electrostatic attraction; occurs in aqueous media and at solid-liquid interfaces; involves synthetic receptors and macrocyclic hosts; results in host-guest complexes and can trigger fluorescence turn-on operations.', 'Supramolecular chemistry: Encompasses all these interaction types, focusing on noncovalent interactions and inclusion phenomena in water; studies host-guest molecular recognition systems and is enriched by both classical and non-classical hydrophobic effects.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are supramolecular analytical techniques that rely on competitive binding events between a host, an indicator, and an analyte, where the displacement of the indicator by the analyte leads to an optical signal change.', 'Host-guest interactions in IDAs are typically non-covalent and reversible, allowing for dynamic sensing and signal transduction.', 'The choice of interaction type (hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, electrostatic, hydrophobic, or metal-ligand coordination) is dictated by the chemical nature of the host, guest, and indicator, as well as the medium (e.g., aqueous vs. organic).', 'Electrostatic interactions are particularly important in aqueous environments for the recognition of charged analytes (e.g., sulfate, methylated lysine), but their strength and selectivity can be modulated by solvation and entropic effects (e.g., solute-solvent reorganization entropy, DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Hydrogen bonding is often attenuated in water but can be enhanced in organic media or within hydrophobic cavities.', 'Hydrophobic interactions and π-π stacking are especially relevant for aromatic guests and hosts with large hydrophobic surfaces or cavities.', "Molecular recognition in IDAs can be fine-tuned by modifying the host's cavity size, conformation, and substitution pattern (e.g., triazine ring substitution).", 'Supramolecular chemistry provides the conceptual and methodological framework for designing IDAs, with applications in biological sensing (e.g., protein, insulin, arginine/lysine methylation) and materials science.'], 'relationships': ['Hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, hydrophobic, and π-π stacking interactions are all non-covalent forces that can act cooperatively or competitively in host-guest recognition, directly influencing the sensitivity and selectivity of IDAs.', 'Electrostatic interactions are often primary drivers for recognition events in aqueous IDAs, especially for charged analytes, but can be overwhelmed by high-energy water release (DOI:10.1039/D0QO00649A).', 'Hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions can act in concert to stabilize host-guest complexes, particularly in water-soluble architectures (e.g., between positively charged hosts and aromatic/dianionic guests).', 'The entropic contribution of electrostatic interactions can be canceled by solute-solvent and solvent reorganization entropy, affecting the net binding energetics (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Host-guest recognition in IDAs is a specialization of supramolecular chemistry, which itself is a subfield of chemical science focused on noncovalent interactions and molecular assemblies.', 'The design of IDAs can leverage macrocyclic hosts (e.g., calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillarenes) that provide defined cavities for selective guest binding via multiple interaction types.']}
