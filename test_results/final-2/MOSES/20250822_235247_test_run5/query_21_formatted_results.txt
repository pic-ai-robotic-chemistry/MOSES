{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are capable of detecting a wide range of molecular analytes, including small molecules, ions, peptides, proteins, post-translationally modified biomolecules, and drugs, by exploiting competitive binding interactions with host recognition elements and indicator dyes.', 'key_points': ['IDAs detect analytes via competitive binding, where the analyte displaces an indicator dye from a host recognition element (e.g., deep_cavitand, calixarene, carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene(WP6)).', 'Specific analytes detected by IDA include trimethylated_lysine, caffeine, and a broad spectrum of amino acids (e.g., L_lysine, L_arginine, L_histidine, L_tryptophan, L_phenylalanine), peptides (e.g., AR-Kme_1-STGGK, PATGGV-Kme_3-KPHRY), proteins (e.g., histone_h3, cytochrome_c, human_insulin), and post-translationally modified peptides (e.g., monomethyllysine(Kme_1), dimethyllysine(Kme_2), trimethyllysine(Kme_3), acetylated_histone_h4kac).', 'IDA can detect a variety of ions, including metal ions (e.g., copper_center), anions (e.g., chloride_ion(Cl-), bromide_ion(Br-), iodide_ion(I-), sulfate_anion, phosphate_anion, oxalate(c2o4)2-, perchlorate_ion(ClO4-), perrhenate_ion(ReO4-), thiocyanate_ion(SCN-), fluoride_ion(F-)), and cations (e.g., ammonium, alkyldiammonium_cation).', 'IDA is applicable to the detection of drugs and pharmaceuticals (e.g., doxorubicin, five_fluorouracil(5-FU), ethambutol, methotrexate(MTX), cocaine, ranitidine, sotalol, paraquat, dibucaine(DC), MDMA).', 'IDA can be used for the detection of biomolecules such as nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, RNA, single_stranded_dna(ssDNA)), carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, beta_D_glucopyranose), and saccharides.', 'Analytes can be detected in diverse environments, including aqueous solution, lipid membrane constructs, and living cells.', 'Quantitative parameters: Association constant for analyte-host interaction can be as low as 2.0 Ã— 10^2 (unit not specified), with analyte stability preserved under conditions such as 95% water/5% deuterium oxide at pH 1.'], 'background_information': ['IDA utilizes host-guest chemistry, where a host molecule (e.g., deep_cavitand, calixarene, pillararene, cyclodextrin, cucurbituril, resorcinarene) forms a complex with an indicator dye; the presence of an analyte with higher affinity results in displacement of the dye, producing a measurable signal (often optical or fluorescent).', 'Indicator dyes used in IDA include lucigenin, dye_28, safranine_T(ST), and various fluorescent indicators, enabling detection via changes in absorbance or fluorescence.', 'Recognition elements in IDA can be tailored for selectivity towards specific analytes, such as methylated lysine derivatives or caffeine, by modifying the host structure or the indicator.', 'IDA is compatible with complex biological matrices, including living cells and lipid membrane constructs, allowing for in situ or real-time detection of analytes.', 'Analytes detected by IDA span a wide chemical space: small organic molecules, charged and neutral species, peptides, proteins, post-translationally modified biomolecules, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and drugs.', 'Competitive binding in IDA can involve parallel or perpendicular complex conformations between analyte and host (e.g., calixarene), and analyte-host complexes can be characterized by association constants and stability under specific experimental conditions.'], 'relationships': ['IDA relies on competitive binding between the analyte and indicator dye for the host recognition element, with displacement of the indicator serving as the detection mechanism.', 'Host molecules (e.g., deep_cavitand, calixarene, pillararene, cyclodextrin, cucurbituril) determine the selectivity and affinity for specific analytes, enabling detection of structurally diverse molecules.', 'Indicator dyes (e.g., lucigenin, safranine_T(ST)) provide the optical or fluorescent readout upon displacement, linking molecular recognition to signal generation.', 'Analyte detection is influenced by the chemical environment (e.g., aqueous solution, lipid membrane, living cells), host-analyte association constants, and the stability of the analyte-host complex.', 'IDA can be applied for the selective detection of post-translational modifications (e.g., methylation, acetylation) on peptides and proteins, as well as for the sensing of drugs, ions, and biomolecules in complex samples.']}
