{'summary': 'Cage molecules and macrocycles both serve as hosts in supramolecular chemistry, with significant overlap in applications such as molecular recognition, host-guest chemistry, catalysis, and drug delivery, but differ in structural features and specific application profiles due to their distinct cavity architectures.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules (including molecular cages and cage-like compounds) are characterized by their ability to accommodate specific guest moieties (e.g., indole ring, ala methyl group) within a well-defined, often enclosed, three-dimensional cavity, enabling applications in molecular encapsulation, selective binding, and host-guest complex formation.', 'Macrocycles (macrocyclic compounds, macrocyclic hosts, macrocyclic receptors) possess large, often hydrophobic, rigid, and preorganized cavities with high symmetry, enabling high-affinity and selective binding of a wide range of guests (amino acids, peptides, proteins, metal ions, organic guests) and are widely used in molecular recognition, chemosensing, catalysis, drug delivery, and supramolecular assembly.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are applied in drug delivery, catalysis, chemosensing, fluorescence switching, molecular delivery, separation, nanotechnology, and supramolecular dye lasers, with high selectivity and affinity for biologically relevant molecules, metal ions, and organic guests (DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081; DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663).', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies (e.g., cyclodextrin, cucurbituril) are used for bioimaging, light harvesting energy transfer, photodynamic therapy, targeted drug delivery, and topological morphology control, leveraging their stimulus responsiveness and structural motifs.', 'Macrocyclic receptors are crucial for biomedical applications, drug delivery, drug design, and self-assembly processes, with high selectivity and affinity for amino acids, peptides, proteins, and ions, driven by noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, ion-dipole, van der Waals) (DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479).', 'Both cages and macrocycles are involved in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and selective binding, but macrocycles offer greater design diversity, functionalization, and integration into nanostructures and sensing scaffolds (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Macrocycles are readily modified and tuned, with well-developed synthetic procedures, high yields (e.g., 64% for certain macrocycles, DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663), and excellent host-guest properties, making them convenient building blocks for supramolecular aggregates and molecular architectures.', 'Cage-like compounds (e.g., sulfonatocalix(n)arene) feature p-electron rich cavities and multiple sulfonate groups, supporting selective encapsulation and host-guest interactions.'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles include a broad range of subtypes such as cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararene, and triazine-based hosts, each with unique cavity sizes, hydrophobicity, and functional group compatibility, allowing for tailored guest binding and application-specific design (DOI:10.1002/ejoc.201601663).', 'Macrocyclic hosts and receptors are often water-soluble (improved by hydrophilic group introduction), rigid, and possess high symmetry and electron-rich cavities, supporting complexation with a wide range of guests, especially electron-deficient species (DOI:10.1002/chem.201605394).', 'Macrocycles are characterized by high binding affinities (nanomolar to micromolar range), strong shielding effects, and the ability to form inclusion complexes, with selectivity for specific analytes, drugs, biomolecules, and organic compounds (DOI:10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Macrocyclic systems are developed to improve chemotherapy drugs and other therapeutic agents, leveraging their molecular recognition and delivery capabilities (DOI:10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies exhibit stimulus responsiveness, enabling applications in controlled drug release, bioimaging, and photodynamic therapy.', 'Cage molecules, while less structurally diverse than macrocycles, provide highly confined guest environments, supporting applications in selective encapsulation, molecular recognition, and catalysis, particularly where a three-dimensional enclosure is advantageous.', 'Both cages and macrocycles are integral to supramolecular chemistry, with roles in host-guest interaction, molecular recognition, and the construction of supramolecular aggregates and assemblies.'], 'relationships': ['Significant overlap exists between cage molecules and macrocycles in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, selective binding, catalysis, and drug delivery, with both classes acting as supramolecular hosts for a variety of guests.', 'Macrocycles, due to their structural diversity, functionalization potential, and integration into nanostructures, are more widely applied in chemosensing, nanotechnology, and supramolecular assembly than cage molecules.', 'Cage molecules provide more enclosed, three-dimensional guest environments, while macrocycles offer larger, more accessible cavities with tunable properties, leading to differences in guest selectivity and application scope.', 'Macrocyclic hosts and receptors are often used in combination with fluorogenic dyes to modulate optical properties, a feature less common in cage molecules.', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies leverage the modularity and stimulus responsiveness of macrocycles for advanced applications such as targeted drug delivery, bioimaging, and light harvesting, which are less typical for cage molecules.']}
