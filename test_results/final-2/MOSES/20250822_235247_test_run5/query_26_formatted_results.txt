{'summary': 'The principal types of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions are calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, cucurbiturils, and crown ethers, all of which are macrocyclic or container molecules with electron-rich aromatic cavities or portals that facilitate strong cation-π binding.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes possess a bowl-shaped, electron-rich aromatic cavity formed by phenolic units and methylene bridges, enabling strong cation-π interactions with cationic guests such as acetylcholine, amine drugs, and methylated lysine residues. They are classified as macrocycles, macrocyclic arenes, and synthetic container molecules, and are used in drug detection, drug contamination removal, and as affinity pull-down reagents.', 'Cyclophanes are synthetic container molecules with cyclic arrangements of aromatic units (e.g., ethenoanthracene, xylene) that create binding pockets for organic cationic guests, including alkylammonium ions and acetylcholine, via cation-π interactions. They are structurally related to calixarenes and are used as synthetic receptors in host-guest chemistry.', 'Pillararenes feature an electron-rich cavity and are macrocyclic arenes that bind cationic guests, particularly amine groups, through cation-π interactions. They exhibit selectivity for methylated lysine and L-asparagine, and are used for molecular recognition of methylated amino acids.', 'Cucurbiturils are macrocyclic hosts with carbonyl-lined portals and aromatic walls, facilitating cation-π interactions with guests such as amino acids, peptides, and methylated lysine. They are used in catalysis, molecular recognition, and as high-affinity binding agents for aromatic side chains.', 'Crown ethers are macrocyclic compounds with cation-complexing properties, binding amine groups and ammonium cations through cation-π and ion-dipole interactions. They are used in host-guest molecular recognition systems, particularly with trimethylammonium ions.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts are typically inspired by natural protein binding pockets and are created by de novo design to target biological molecules such as amino acids, peptides, and proteins, especially those with posttranslational methylation (e.g., trimethyllysine).', 'These hosts function as sequestration agents, often in physiologically relevant media (e.g., warm, salty water), and are designed for selectivity toward methylation state and biological targets, with strong binding affinity sufficient to out-compete native reader proteins (e.g., for trimethyllysine).', 'Cation-π interactions are a type of weak, non-covalent interaction critical in the binding pockets of both proteins and synthetic hosts, particularly for the recognition of methylated amino acids and peptides.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, cucurbiturils, and crown ethers are classified as artificial hosts, macrocyclic synthetic receptors, and water-soluble macrocyclic hosts, and are widely used in supramolecular chemistry, chemical biology, and biochemistry for molecular recognition, sensing, and catalysis.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, cucurbiturils, and crown ethers are all descendants of the supramolecular host class and share the macrocyclic architecture that enables cation-π interactions.', 'These hosts are structurally and functionally compared to protein binding pockets, with the ability to discriminate between methylation states of amino acids and peptides, and to selectively bind posttranslationally methylated partners (e.g., trimethyllysine).', 'Cation-π interactions are directly involved in the molecular recognition processes of these hosts, particularly in the binding of cationic guests such as methylated lysine, acetylcholine, and ammonium ions.', 'The selectivity and binding affinity of these hosts for methylated targets are critical for their application in biological systems, enabling them to function as sequestration agents and to out-compete native reader proteins in binding assays.']}
