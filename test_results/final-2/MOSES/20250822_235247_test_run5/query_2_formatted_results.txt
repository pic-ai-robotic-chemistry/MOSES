{'summary': 'An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular analytical technique in which an indicator dye, initially bound to a host molecule (receptor), is displaced by an analyte (guest), resulting in a measurable signal—often optical—used for detection and quantification of the analyte.', 'key_points': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a sensing method where a dye (indicator) is displaced from a host molecule by an analyte, producing a measurable signal (e.g., fluorescence or absorbance change).', 'The host molecule (receptor) forms a complex with an indicator dye; upon introduction of a guest (analyte), the dye is competitively displaced due to higher affinity of the host for the analyte.', 'IDA is compatible with differential sensing, allowing construction of sensor arrays by combining multiple receptors and indicators for pattern-based recognition.', 'IDA is applied for ultrasensitive and specific detection of analytes such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), post-translational modifications in proteins, and caffeine.', 'Common indicator dyes include lucigenin and dye_28; host molecules include deep cavitands, carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6), and synthetic receptors.', 'Assays can be performed in lipid membrane constructs and living cells, and are suitable for aqueous media and live-cell environments.', 'The interaction between host and guest is non-covalent, and the output is typically optical (e.g., fluorescence, absorbance).', 'IDA can be coupled with differential sensing strategies for enhanced selectivity and sensitivity.'], 'background_information': ['IDA is a subclass of pattern-based sensing and reporting element strategies, and is rooted in supramolecular chemistry and molecular recognition.', 'The method is highly adaptable, with sensor conversion capability and compatibility with live-cell assays and biological locations.', 'IDA is used in supramolecular analytical chemistry, particularly for optical sensing applications, and can target a wide range of analytes including metal cations, anions, drugs, and biological molecules.', 'Components used in IDA systems include beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), poly(N-acetylaniline), graphene, and safranine T (ST).', 'IDA is more compatible with differential sensing than many other approaches, as arrays can be constructed by combining multiple receptors and indicators, enabling multiplexed detection.', 'IDA has been used to detect and quantify targets such as trimethylated lysine, hypoxia, choline analogs, betaine, and tcc_cavitand complexes.', 'The technique is a key tool in supramolecular analytical chemistry for the quantification and discrimination of structurally similar analytes.'], 'relationships': ['IDA uses host-guest chemistry: the host (e.g., deep cavitand, WP6, synthetic receptor) binds an indicator dye, which is displaced by the analyte (guest) due to competitive binding.', 'The displacement event is transduced into an optical signal by the indicator, enabling quantification of the analyte.', 'IDA is often coupled with differential sensing, where sensor arrays are constructed for pattern-based recognition of multiple analytes (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'IDA is applied in both in vitro (lipid membrane constructs) and in vivo (living cells, live-cell) environments.', 'IDA can be used for the detection of post-translational modifications, small molecules (e.g., caffeine), and biological targets (e.g., LPA, trimethylated lysine).', 'The method is a technique of supramolecular analytical chemistry and is closely related to optical sensing and molecular recognition strategies.']}
