{'summary': 'Host-guest interaction is governed by a complex interplay of non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, π-π stacking, hydrophobic and electrostatic effects), molecular complementarity, and thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy, entropy, free energy), all of which are modulated by solvent effects, selectivity, and specificity.', 'key_points': ['Non-covalent interactions are the primary forces controlling host-guest interaction, including hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, π-π stacking interactions, hydrophobic effects, and electrostatic interactions.', 'Hydrogen bonds stabilize host-guest complexes (e.g., vase conformation, dimeric capsules), with measured hydrogen bond distances (2.508–2.968 Å) and are validated by atoms-in-molecules and reduced density gradient analyses (DOI:10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Van der Waals interactions are most relevant for selectivity, contribute to anion binding, protein denaturation, and Hofmeister effects, and involve structures such as the inner wall of Q(7) and PAL (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'π-π stacking interactions between macrocycles and electron-deficient guests influence association constants.', 'Hydrophobic effect is a major driving force in aqueous solution, entropically favored, and is influenced by molecular shape, apolar chain length, and is complemented by ion-dipole interactions (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Electrostatic interactions are non-covalent forces between charged groups, extremely sensitive to the environment, and can be overwhelmed by high-energy water release (DOI:10.1039/D0QO00649A). They are less relevant for selectivity but are a primary driving force for guest location (DOI:10.1002/chem.201605394).', 'Thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy, entropy, free energy) are critical: enthalpy (ΔH) is often the main driving force (ΔH range: -4.22 to -14.31 kcal mol⁻¹), while entropy (–TΔS) can be unfavorable or compensatory, and free energy (ΔG) integrates both contributions (DOI:10.1021/jacs.6b04372).', 'Solvent effects significantly influence complexation: polar solvents (e.g., D2O) can weaken host-guest interactions, and the polarizable continuum model (PCM) is used for solvent effect calculations (DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).', 'Selectivity and specificity are determined by the interplay of non-covalent interactions, with van der Waals and hydrogen bonds being most relevant for selectivity, and are measured by NMR and fluorescence displacement assays (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Molecular complementarity (size, shape, and conformational rigidity of host and guest) is essential for effective molecular recognition and binding.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest interaction is a subclass of molecular recognition and non-covalent interaction, central to supramolecular chemistry and biomolecular interaction.', 'Host-guest chemistry is investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, 1H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and UV-Vis spectroscopy, often in aqueous solution (DOI:10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107919; DOI:10.1002/chem.201800587).', 'Molecular recognition is governed by weak interactions, occurs in aqueous environments, and is influenced by cavity size and rigid cone conformation (DOI:10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Thermodynamic parameters are measured by ITC and fluorescence titration experiments, and are affected by ionic strength and concentration (DOI:10.1021/jacs.6b04372).', 'Hydrophobic effect is modeled by synthetic receptors and membranes, and is illustrated by guest binding data (DOI:10.1021/ja0727058).', 'Electrostatic interactions are evaluated by DFT calculations and occur between specific functional groups (e.g., lysine residue and sulfonate group, DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'Enthalpy and entropy changes are measured during complexation, with enthalpy often driving the process due to displacement of high-energy water molecules from the host cavity.', 'Entropy is composed of entropy of translation (ΔS_trans) and entropy of rotation (ΔS_rot), and its contribution can be elusive and context-dependent (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Selectivity is the ratio of binding or activity between different states (e.g., Kme0/Kme3), and is influenced by interfering molecules and measured by NMR or fluorescence displacement assays.', 'Specificity refers to the ability to target a particular analyte or modification, and is a parent concept to selectivity.'], 'relationships': ['Hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, π-π stacking, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions act synergistically or competitively to determine host-guest binding strength, selectivity, and specificity.', 'Thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy, entropy, free energy) quantitatively describe the energetics of host-guest complexation, integrating the contributions of all non-covalent interactions and solvent effects.', 'Solvent effects modulate the strength and nature of non-covalent interactions, with polar solvents generally weakening host-guest binding.', 'Molecular complementarity (size, shape, rigidity) of host and guest is a prerequisite for effective molecular recognition, influencing the balance of non-covalent interactions and thermodynamic parameters.', 'Selectivity and specificity are emergent properties resulting from the interplay of all non-covalent interactions and molecular complementarity, and are experimentally measured by NMR and fluorescence-based assays.']}
