{'summary': 'Host molecules that utilize host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays include macrocyclic compounds such as cyclodextrins (notably beta-cyclodextrin), calixarenes, cucurbiturils, crown ethers, and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). These hosts form specific complexes with guest molecules, enabling supramolecular recognition mechanisms that are integrated into electrochemical sensors and assays.', 'key_points': ['Host molecules in electrochemical assays employ host-guest recognition by forming complexes with guest molecules, often via macrocyclic cavities or inclusion complexes.', 'Key classes of host molecules identified include: cyclodextrins (e.g., beta-cyclodextrin/β-CD), calixarenes, cucurbiturils (e.g., cucurbit[7]uril/CB(7), cucurbit[8]uril/CB(8)), crown ethers, and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs).', 'Host-guest recognition is directly integrated with electrochemical sensors and assays, as evidenced by the relationship: host-guest_recognition integrates_with electrochemical_assay and is_integrated_with electrochemical_sensor.', 'Specific host-guest pairs used in electrochemical assays include beta-cyclodextrin (host) with methylene blue (guest), and the first integration of host-guest recognition with electrochemical assay was reported for quinine determination.', 'Host molecules possess macrocyclic cavities (e.g., large bowl-shaped cavity), can form inclusion complexes, and exhibit properties such as charge transfer, π-bonding, and electron localization with guest molecules.', 'Host molecules can reduce the critical aggregation concentration of guest molecules, promote aggregation of amphiphilic or aromatic guests, and undergo changes in chemical hardness after adsorption (e.g., decreased chemical hardness, DOI: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Host molecules are often optimized and characterized using density functional theory (DFT) and equilibrium geometry (EG) calculations (DOI: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).'], 'background_information': ['The host-guest recognition mechanism relies on supramolecular interactions, including hydrogen bonding, π-π interactions, charge transfer, and hydrophobic effects, which are facilitated by the macrocyclic structure of host molecules.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and crown ethers provide a defined cavity for selective guest binding, which is critical for the specificity and sensitivity of electrochemical assays.', 'Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) act as synthetic host matrices with tailored binding sites for target analytes, mimicking natural host-guest systems.', 'Host-guest complexes can modulate the electrochemical response by altering electron transfer, aggregation behavior, and the local environment at the electrode interface.', 'The electron localization function (ELF) distribution shows that electrons condense in interacting regions between host and guest (DOI: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Host molecules can interact with functional groups such as NH and OH groups on guest molecules, and can form π-bonds with drug molecules (DOI: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'Host molecules are capable of forming inclusion complexes, which are essential for the selective recognition and signal transduction in electrochemical assays (DOI: 10.1007/s10847-018-0786-0).'], 'relationships': ['Host-guest recognition is functionally integrated with electrochemical sensors and assays, enabling selective detection of analytes via supramolecular interactions.', 'Beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a prototypical host molecule, forming inclusion complexes with guests such as methylene blue (MB), and is specifically cited as a host in electrochemical host-guest systems.', 'Host molecules form complexes with guest molecules through macrocyclic cavities, leading to changes in aggregation, charge transfer, and electron distribution, which are transduced into measurable electrochemical signals.', 'The reduction in critical aggregation concentration and changes in chemical hardness upon host-guest complexation directly impact the performance of electrochemical assays.', 'Host molecules are structurally diverse, with a large number of macrocyclic derivatives (e.g., various cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararenes, cavitands) available for tailored host-guest recognition in different assay formats.']}
