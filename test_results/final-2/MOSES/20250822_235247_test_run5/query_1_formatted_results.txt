{'summary': 'Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid derived from cinchona tree bark, primarily used as an antimalarial agent and detected or analyzed by a range of advanced analytical techniques. It exhibits low solubility in water, is typically prepared in ethanol at a 10 mM stock concentration, and is associated with both therapeutic applications and significant adverse health effects.', 'key_points': ['Quinine is classified as an alkaloid and is a component of cinchona tree bark.', 'Primary applications include treatment of malaria, lupus, arthritis, and muscle cramp; it is also used as a bittering agent.', 'Quinine is hydrophobic and exhibits low solubility in water.', 'Stock solutions are commonly prepared in ethanol at a concentration of 10 mM and may be diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS).', 'A 1:1 molar ratio with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is noted in certain contexts.', 'Incubation time for relevant assays is specified as 40 min.', 'Recovery rates in analytical procedures range from 98.3% to 109.3%.', 'Quinine induces adverse health effects including thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, blindness, and acute kidney injury.', 'A slight proton peak shift is observed in NMR or related spectroscopic analysis.', 'In detection schemes, quinine serves as a target analyte.'], 'background_information': ['Quinine is analyzed and detected using a variety of advanced analytical techniques, including electrochemical techniques, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), colorimetric assays, fluorescence assays, and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).', 'Specific detection methods include quantitative electrochemical methods, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), and electrochemiluminescence biosensors.', 'Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) is used to determine quinine in certain analytical contexts.', "The use of ethanol as a solvent for stock solutions is necessitated by quinine's hydrophobicity and low aqueous solubility.", "Quinine's role as a bittering agent is significant in the food and beverage industry, particularly in tonic water."], 'relationships': ['Quinine is a natural product alkaloid derived from cinchona tree bark, establishing its botanical and chemical origin.', 'Its hydrophobicity and low water solubility dictate the use of ethanol as a solvent and PBS for dilution in laboratory protocols.', 'The 1:1 molar ratio with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) suggests inclusion complex formation, which may enhance solubility or modify analytical properties.', "Quinine's adverse health effects are directly linked to its pharmacological and toxicological profile, necessitating careful monitoring in therapeutic and analytical applications.", 'The range of analytical techniques used for quinine reflects its importance as both a pharmaceutical agent and a target analyte in complex matrices.']}
