{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests via cation-π interactions are aromatic macrocyclic hosts, specifically calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils, which utilize electron-rich aromatic cavities to interact with cationic guests.', 'key_points': ['Aromatic macrocycles, including calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils, are the principal supramolecular hosts that bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions.', 'Calixarenes (e.g., calix(4)arene, calix(6)arene, calix(8)arene, p-sulfonatocalix(n)arene) possess bowl-shaped, electron-rich aromatic cavities that facilitate strong cation-π interactions with cationic guests such as ammonium ions and methylated lysines.', 'Cyclophanes (e.g., Dougherty ethenoanthracene receptor, cationic cyclophane 1a, anionic cyclophane 1b) are cyclic aromatic hosts with rigid, concave aromatic surfaces, specifically designed for cation-π recognition of alkylammonium ions and acetylcholine, with reported dissociation constants as low as 50 μM (10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Pillararenes (e.g., pillar(5)arene, pillar(6)arene, pillar(7)arene, cationic pillararenes) are macrocyclic hosts composed of hydroquinone units linked at para-positions, forming symmetric, electron-rich, pillar-shaped cavities that enable cation-π binding of organic cations.', 'Cucurbiturils (e.g., cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), cucurbit[8]uril (CB8)) are rigid, highly symmetric macrocyclic hosts with hydrophobic, electron-rich interiors and carbonyl-lined portals, capable of high-affinity cation-π binding to methylated lysines, ammonium ions, and aromatic cations.', 'These macrocyclic hosts are characterized by high symmetry, rigid and electron-rich cavities, and are often water-soluble or can be functionalized for aqueous compatibility, making them suitable for biological and chemical applications involving cation-π recognition.'], 'background_information': ['Aromatic macrocycles are large cyclic molecules containing aromatic units, capable of mimicking biological aromatic cages and providing concave, electron-rich surfaces for cation-π interactions (10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Calixarenes are macrocyclic phenolic compounds with hydrophobic cavities, high derivatization capability, and adjustable size/shape, allowing for selective binding of cationic guests via cation-π and π-π interactions. They are used for recognition of methylated lysines, amino acids, and peptides, and can disrupt protein–histone interactions (10.1002/cbic.201800398, 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Cyclophanes are cyclic phenylalkanes with aromatic rings connected by aliphatic bridges, forming rigid, concave structures. They were among the first synthetic receptors for alkylammonium ions via cation-π interactions and are structurally analogous to biological aromatic cages (10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Pillararenes, composed of para-linked hydroquinone units, are a new generation of macrocyclic hosts with symmetric, electron-rich cavities, facile functionalization, and strong host-guest binding abilities, especially for cationic guests (10.1002/chem.201605394).', 'Cucurbiturils are synthetic container molecules with rigid, hydrophobic, electron-rich interiors and carbonyl portals, providing high-affinity, selective cation-π binding for methylated lysines, peptides, and organic cations. They are widely used in molecular recognition, catalysis, and drug delivery (10.1002/cbic.201800398, 10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004).', 'Macrocyclic hosts, including the above classes, are characterized by high symmetry, rigidity, electron-rich cavities, and the ability to form host-guest complexes via non-covalent interactions, especially cation-π interactions. Their water solubility and functionalization potential make them suitable for applications in chemical biology, molecular recognition, and supramolecular assembly (10.1039/c6cc04771hHost, 10.1002/chem.201605394).'], 'relationships': ['Aromatic macrocycles (aromatic_macrocycle) are structural analogues of biological aromatic cages and include cyclophanes as typical examples (10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Calixarenes, cyclophanes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils are all subclasses of macrocyclic hosts (macrocyclic_host), which are themselves a subclass of supramolecular hosts (supramolecular_host).', 'Calixarenes and cyclophanes are both m-cyclophanes, sharing structural features that promote cation-π interactions.', 'Cucurbiturils and calixarenes are both used for the recognition of methylated lysines, with cucurbiturils generally exhibiting higher binding affinities (10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cyclophanes and calixarenes are compared to cucurbiturils in terms of water solubility and cation-π binding capabilities.', 'Macrocyclic hosts can be functionalized with hydrophilic groups to improve water solubility without disturbing their cation-π binding function (10.1002/ejoc.201601663).', 'All these macrocyclic hosts are used in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and can be tailored for selectivity towards specific cationic guests, including biologically relevant targets such as methylated amino acids and neurotransmitters.']}
