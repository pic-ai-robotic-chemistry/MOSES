{'summary': 'Electrochemical sensors utilizing Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) for quinine detection are verified through a combination of electrochemical, spectroscopic, and analytical performance evaluations, including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and reproducibility/selectivity assessments.', 'key_points': ['Verification methods for electrochemical sensors using IDA for quinine detection include differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H_NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).', 'Reproducibility is quantitatively assessed, with a reported relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven identical electrodes, and five independent electrodes displaying similar signals for 30 μM quinine.', 'Selectivity is demonstrated by superior selectivity over common interfering molecules, with selectivity influenced by electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, and hydrogen bonds.', 'Stability is evaluated by monitoring the DPV signal over time: negligible change during the first 7 days at 4°C, and 86.47% of the original value retained up to 21 days.', 'Recovery rates for quinine detection range from 98.3% to 109.3%, indicating high analytical accuracy.', 'Repeatability is confirmed by consistent signals across multiple electrodes for the same quinine concentration.', 'Calibration curves are prepared using concentrated stock solutions and relevant complexes (e.g., 2pf@q(8)_complex, aqueous solution).'], 'background_information': ['Electrochemical sensors for quinine are based on nanocomposites and constructed using indicator displacement assay (IDA), which relies on non-covalent interactions and can be coupled with differential sensing strategies.', 'IDA involves a synthetic receptor, an indicator, and a signaling unit, and is capable of converting molecular recognition events into measurable sensor outputs.', 'Quinine acts as the target analyte in the detection scheme, with a typical 1:1 molar ratio with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and low solubility in water; stock solutions are commonly prepared in ethanol at 10 mM concentration and diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS).', 'Selectivity is measured by NMR and fluorescence displacement assays, and is defined as the ratio of binding or activity between different states (e.g., Kme0/Kme3).', 'Reproducibility is achieved through controlled fabrication methods, and sensor properties such as reusability, stability, and cost-effectiveness are also considered in the overall verification process.', 'The sensor platform is simple, cost-effective, and exhibits high stability, with acceptable peak current decrease within 21 days.'], 'relationships': ['The electrochemical sensor is constructed by IDA and is based on nanocomposite materials, with quinine as the detection target.', 'Verification involves both electrochemical (DPV, CV, EIS) and spectroscopic (H_NMR, FTIR, SEM) techniques, ensuring comprehensive characterization of sensor performance.', "Selectivity and reproducibility are core analytical performance metrics, directly linked to the sensor's fabrication method and the supramolecular chemistry of the IDA system.", 'Calibration curves, prepared from concentrated stock solutions and relevant complexes, are essential for quantitative analysis and validation of sensor response.', 'Stability and repeatability assessments are interconnected, as both rely on consistent sensor response over time and across multiple electrodes.']}
