{'summary': 'No direct evidence was found for the use of indicator displacement assay (IDA) in electrochemical sensors specifically for the detection of quinine. However, both IDA and quinine are independently associated with electrochemical and related sensing methodologies, suggesting potential compatibility.', 'key_points': ['No direct records or examples were found of electrochemical sensors employing indicator displacement assay (IDA) for quinine detection.', 'Indicator displacement assay (IDA) is characterized by the use of a synthetic receptor, an indicator, and a signaling unit, and is known to be coupled with differential sensing and performed in live cell environments. Its sensor output is typically optical, not electrochemical.', 'Quinine is detected and analyzed by several electrochemical techniques, including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), electrochemical techniques, electrochemiluminescence biosensors, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), and quantitative electrochemical methods.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assay (IDA) targets a range of analytes, including drugs, anions, biological molecules, and metal cations, and utilizes components such as beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), graphene, and poly(N-acetylaniline).', 'IDA is primarily associated with optical sensors as the output modality, rather than electrochemical sensors.', 'Quinine is an alkaloid derived from cinchona tree bark and is used for the treatment of malaria, lupus, arthritis, and muscle cramps, as well as a bittering agent.', 'Quinine can be dissolved in ethanol and diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for analytical purposes.', 'Quinine is also analyzed by colorimetric assay, fluorescence assay, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).'], 'relationships': ['IDA and quinine are both associated with drug analysis and detection, but there is no direct evidence of their integration in an electrochemical sensor format.', 'IDA is structurally compatible with analyte detection (including drugs), and quinine is a drug analyte detectable by electrochemical methods, indicating a potential but undocumented compatibility.', 'IDA is typically coupled with optical sensor outputs, while quinine is commonly detected by electrochemical sensor outputs, suggesting a methodological gap in the literature or ontology data.']}
