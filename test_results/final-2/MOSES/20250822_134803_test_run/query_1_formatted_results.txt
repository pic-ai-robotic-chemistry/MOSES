{'summary': 'Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid derived from cinchona tree bark, primarily used as an antimalarial agent and as a bittering agent, with applications in treating lupus, arthritis, and muscle cramps. It exhibits low solubility in water, is typically prepared in ethanol at 10 mM concentration, and is analyzed and detected using a range of advanced analytical techniques.', 'key_points': ['Quinine is classified as an alkaloid and is a component of cinchona tree bark.', 'It is hydrophobic and exhibits low solubility in water.', 'Stock solutions of quinine are commonly prepared in ethanol at a concentration of 10 mM.', 'Quinine forms a 1:1 molar ratio complex with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD).', 'It is used for the treatment of malaria, lupus, arthritis, and muscle cramps, and as a bittering agent.', 'Quinine is a target analyte in detection schemes and is analyzed by electrochemical techniques, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), colorimetric assays, fluorescence assays, and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).', 'It is specifically determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and detected by quantitative electrochemical methods, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), and electrochemiluminescence biosensors.', 'Recovery rates for quinine detection range from 98.3% to 109.3%.', 'A slight proton peak shift is observed in relevant analytical measurements.', 'Incubation time for certain assays is 40 minutes.', 'Quinine is diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for some analytical procedures.', 'Adverse health effects associated with quinine include thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, blindness, and acute kidney injury.', 'Quinine induces the same adverse effects as those listed above.'], 'background_information': ["Quinine's role as a bittering agent is notable in the context of food and beverage applications, such as tonic water.", 'Its hydrophobicity and low water solubility necessitate the use of organic solvents like ethanol for stock solution preparation and PBS for dilution in analytical protocols.', 'The 1:1 molar ratio with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) suggests inclusion complex formation, which can enhance solubility and stability for analytical or pharmaceutical applications.', 'The use of advanced analytical techniques (DPV, HPLC, HRMS, fluorescence, and colorimetric assays) reflects the need for sensitive and selective detection of quinine in complex matrices.', 'Quinine poisoning is a recognized clinical entity, with the compound being the direct cause of toxic effects such as thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, blindness, and acute kidney injury.', "Quinine's parent class is alkaloid, and it has a child class β-quinine, indicating structural or functional analogs within the alkaloid family."], 'relationships': ['Quinine is a component of cinchona tree bark and belongs to the alkaloid class.', 'It is used for both therapeutic (malaria, lupus, arthritis, muscle cramp) and non-therapeutic (bittering agent) purposes.', 'Quinine is the target analyte in various detection schemes, with its presence determined by multiple analytical techniques, including DPV, HPLC, HRMS, fluorescence, and colorimetric assays.', 'The formation of a 1:1 complex with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is relevant for solubility enhancement and analytical applications.', 'Quinine is both the cause and the inducer of adverse health effects such as thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, blindness, and acute kidney injury, as recognized in the context of quinine poisoning.', 'Analytical protocols for quinine involve dissolution in ethanol, dilution in PBS, and incubation for 40 minutes, with recovery rates between 98.3% and 109.3%.', 'A slight proton peak shift is observed in analytical measurements, indicating possible interactions or complex formation.']}
