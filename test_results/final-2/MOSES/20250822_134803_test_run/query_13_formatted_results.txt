{'summary': 'Guest molecules for supramolecular hosts encompass a broad range of chemical species, including cationic, anionic, neutral, and organic molecules, each with specific structural, electronic, and physicochemical properties that enable their inclusion in host-guest complexes. These guests are characterized by features such as charge, hydrophobicity, functional groups, and the ability to participate in specific non-covalent interactions with host molecules.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules include cationic guests (e.g., acetyl choline, acetyl thiocholine), anionic guests (e.g., TNS, 2,6-ANS, 1,8-ANS, X-(H2O)), neutral guests, and organic guest molecules (e.g., aromatic compounds, amino acids, peptides, dyes, and small organic molecules).', 'Cationic guests are positively charged molecules, often containing n-substituted alkyl chains, and can bind within macrocyclic cavities (DOI:10.1039/D0QO00649A).', 'Anionic guests are negatively charged and can be solvated at both portals when bound to cyclodextrins (CDs), but not when bound to cavitands (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Organic guest molecules are incorporated by water-soluble hosts such as cyclophanes and cucurbit(n)urils (CBs), and are recognized by macrocycles due to their binding properties.', 'Guest molecules exhibit a range of physicochemical properties: hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity, presence of aromatic moieties, side groups (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, alkyl chains, benzyl groups), and specific functional groups (e.g., imidazole).', 'Many guest molecules are capable of forming hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking interactions, and can participate in complexation with macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and calixarenes.', 'Guest molecules can be characterized by their equilibrium geometry, protonation state, octanol-water partition coefficient (log P), inclusion/exclusion rates, and photophysical properties (e.g., UV-Vis absorption spectrum, red/blue-shifted absorbance peaks, fluorescence response).', "Specific examples of guest molecules include: 5-fluorouracil, 4,4'-bipyridinium salts, amino acids (e.g., L-lysine, alanine), peptides, aromatic compounds (e.g., naphthalene, pyrene), dyes (e.g., acridine orange, rhodamine, safranine T), and small organic/inorganic ions.", 'Guest molecules may be included in hydrophobic cavities, macrocycles, or container compounds, and can be encapsulated in cyclodextrins or macrocyclic host molecules.', 'The presence of side groups (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, positively-charged) and moieties (aromatic, benzyl) is common among guest molecules, influencing their binding affinity and selectivity.'], 'background_information': ['Organic molecules, including biological analytes, are frequently studied as guests for macrocyclic containers in supramolecular chemistry (DOI:10.1021/jo502825z).', 'Organic molecules are primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen, often with nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, and can dimerize with high structural recognition when possessing large lipophilic surfaces and complementary host/guest regions (DOI:10.1021/acs.joc.1c00794).', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and calixarenes exhibit selective recognition and binding of organic guest molecules, with specificity influenced by the structural features of both host and guest.', 'The inclusion of guest molecules in supramolecular hosts can lead to improved solubility in aqueous solution, enhanced photochemical and thermal stability, aggregation protection, and altered fluorescence response (DOI:10.1016/j.dyepig.2016.04.013).', 'Guest molecules can induce property changes in the host-guest system, enabling applications such as drug delivery systems, fluorescent sensors, logic gates, photofunctional materials, and stabilizing additives for laser dyes (DOI:10.1016/j.dyepig.2016.04.013).', 'The binding of guest molecules is often characterized by titration profiles, interaction parameters (alpha), and can exhibit cooperativity (positive, negative, or non-cooperative binding) (DOI:10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'The specificity of organic molecule recognition by macrocycles can be lower than that of calixarenes, which utilize upper-rim modifications for enhanced selectivity (DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Guest molecules may be optimized for host-guest interactions using computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT) (DOI:10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).'], 'relationships': ['Cationic guests interact with macrocyclic hosts via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, often facilitated by n-substituted alkyl chains (DOI:10.1039/D0QO00649A).', 'Anionic guests exhibit different solvation behavior depending on the host: they are solvated at both portals in cyclodextrins but not in cavitands (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Guest molecules with aromatic moieties or hydrophobic side groups preferentially bind to hydrophobic cavities of macrocyclic hosts.', 'The presence of specific functional groups (e.g., imidazole, benzyl) and side groups (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, positively-charged) modulates the binding affinity and selectivity of guest molecules for supramolecular hosts.', 'Guest molecules can form host-guest assemblies, participate in cooperative or non-cooperative binding, and induce functional changes in the supramolecular system (e.g., fluorescence, logic gate behavior, drug delivery).', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, and calixarenes serve as selective containers for a wide variety of guest molecules, with the nature of the guest (charge, size, hydrophobicity) determining the mode and strength of binding.']}
