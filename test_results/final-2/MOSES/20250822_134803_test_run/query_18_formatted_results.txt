{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind anions through anion-π interactions are macrocyclic and acyclic aromatic hosts, with cyclophanes, calixarenes, and aromatic cages being the most prominent classes. These hosts utilize electron-deficient or π-acidic aromatic surfaces to engage anions via anion-π interactions, often in combination with other noncovalent forces.', 'key_points': ['Macrocyclic hosts such as cyclophanes, calixarenes, and their derivatives (e.g., C4A, C5A, C6A, C8A, SCXn complexes, TEMOA) are established supramolecular hosts for anion binding via anion-π interactions.', 'Cyclophanes: These are cyclic phenylalkane derivatives (e.g., 2,6-helix(6)arene, 2,6-helic(6)arene, C4A, C5A, C6A, C8A) with rigid, π-rich cavities that facilitate anion-π binding. Cyclophanes can be functionalized to tune their electron density and selectivity for anions.', 'Calixarenes: Macrocyclic phenolic hosts (e.g., calix(4)arene, calix(6)arene, calix(8)arene, sulfonatocalix(n)arene, tetrasulfonatocalixarene) with bowl-shaped, π-rich cavities. Sulfonated and other electron-deficient derivatives enhance anion-π binding affinity.', 'Aromatic cages: Hosts composed of multiple aromatic residues (aromatic_cage) provide a π-electronic-rich environment for anion-π interactions. These cages typically contain 2–4 aromatic residues and are desolvated, small, and can be occupied by high-energy water molecules prior to anion binding.', 'Acyclic receptors: Molecular tweezers and tripodal receptors (e.g., anionic_tweezer, carboxylate_molecular_tweezer, trisindol_receptor_40) can also present π-acidic surfaces for anion-π binding, though macrocyclic hosts are more common for this interaction.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are characterized by rigid, high-symmetry, electron-rich or electron-deficient π-surfaces, and hydrophobic or nano-cavities that facilitate selective anion binding via anion-π interactions.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions involve the noncovalent attraction between an anion and an electron-deficient (π-acidic) aromatic system. These interactions are typically weaker than classical hydrogen bonds but can be significant in the context of preorganized, rigid host structures.', 'Macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cyclophanes, calixarenes, pillararene derivatives) are preferred for anion-π binding due to their rigid, preorganized cavities and tunable electronic properties. Functionalization (e.g., sulfonation, introduction of electron-withdrawing groups) can enhance π-acidity and anion affinity.', 'Calixarenes and cyclophanes are easily functionalizable, allowing for the introduction of hydrophilic, charged, or electron-withdrawing groups to modulate anion selectivity and solubility. Calixarenes are synthesized via condensation of formaldehyde with p-alkylphenols under basic conditions and can be modified at the upper or lower rim.', 'Aromatic cages are small, π-electronic-rich hosts that do not include carboxylate groups and are capable of both cation-π and anion-π interactions. They are typically composed of 2–4 aromatic residues and are selective for specific guest properties (e.g., methylation state in biological contexts).', 'Macrocyclic hosts are used in a variety of applications including chemosensing, molecular recognition, catalysis, drug delivery, and supramolecular assembly. Their host-guest chemistry is central to the design of selective anion receptors.', 'Acyclic receptors such as molecular tweezers can also bind anions via anion-π interactions, but their flexibility and lack of preorganization generally result in lower selectivity and affinity compared to macrocyclic hosts.'], 'relationships': ['Cyclophanes and calixarenes are both subtypes of macrocyclic hosts and can be further functionalized to enhance anion-π binding (e.g., sulfonatocalixarenes, anionic cyclophanes).', 'Aromatic cages are structurally distinct from macrocyclic hosts but share the feature of providing a π-rich environment for anion-π interactions; they are often used for selective recognition of specific guest features (e.g., methylation state).', 'Macrocyclic hosts (including cyclophanes and calixarenes) are related to acyclic receptors (e.g., molecular tweezers) in their ability to present π-acidic surfaces, but macrocycles offer greater preorganization and selectivity.', 'The presence of electron-deficient aromatic surfaces (π-acidity) is a key determinant for effective anion-π binding across all host types. Functionalization strategies (e.g., sulfonation, introduction of electron-withdrawing groups) are commonly employed to tune this property.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are often water-soluble or can be rendered so by introducing hydrophilic groups, expanding their utility in aqueous environments for anion recognition.']}
