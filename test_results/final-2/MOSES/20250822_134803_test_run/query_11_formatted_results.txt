{'summary': 'A cryptand is a macrobicyclic ligand that acts as a host molecule in supramolecular chemistry, capable of encapsulating guest species—particularly organic guests—within its three-dimensional cavity.', 'key_points': ['Cryptands are a class of macrobicyclic ligands, structurally characterized by their three-dimensional, cage-like architecture that enables encapsulation of guest molecules (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'Cryptands function as host molecules in host-guest chemistry, specifically binding organic guests within their internal cavity (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'Cryptands can be functionalized with anthracene dye or naphthalimide dye, which imparts selectivity for specific anions such as sulfate (DOI_MISSING).', "Cryptands are subclasses of both 'macrobicyclic_ligand' and 'receptor', reflecting their dual roles in molecular recognition and selective binding (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429)."], 'background_information': ['Host-guest chemistry, the field in which cryptands are prominent, is a specialization of supramolecular chemistry and is fundamentally based on molecular recognition (10.1002/anie.202012315).', 'Host-guest chemistry is realized by macrocyclic compounds, molecular cages, molecular capsules, or receptors, and is influenced by factors such as solute structure, solvent, salt, and co-solute (10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'The goal of host-guest chemistry is molecular recognition, with applications in drug delivery and applied bioscience (10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Cryptands, as macrobicyclic ligands, are part of a broader chemical hierarchy that includes supramolecular chemistry, molecular recognition, and receptor science.'], 'relationships': ['Cryptands (macrobicyclic ligands) are host molecules that encapsulate organic guests, establishing a host-guest relationship central to supramolecular chemistry (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'Functionalization of cryptands with anthracene or naphthalimide dyes enables selective recognition of specific anions, such as sulfate, demonstrating the tunability of cryptand host properties (DOI_MISSING).', 'Cryptands are both macrobicyclic ligands and receptors, linking their structural features to their functional roles in molecular recognition and selective binding.']}
