{'summary': 'Host-guest interactions are primarily governed by non-covalent forces—including hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic effects, and π-π stacking—along with molecular complementarity, solvent effects, and thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy, entropy, free energy), all of which collectively determine the specificity, strength, and stoichiometry of binding.', 'key_points': ['Non-covalent interactions are the principal forces controlling host-guest interactions, including: hydrogen bonds (N-H···O, N-H···Ntrz, C-H···π, C-H···O, C-H/Cl), van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions (between charged groups such as lysine residues and sulfonate groups), hydrophobic effects (aggregation of nonpolar substances in aqueous solution), and π-π stacking interactions (between macrocycles and electron-deficient guests).', 'Hydrogen bonds are among the most relevant for selectivity and stabilization of host-guest complexes, with measured hydrogen bond distances ranging from 2.508 Å to 2.968 Å (DOI:10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Electrostatic interactions are extremely sensitive to the environment and can be a primary driving force for guest location within the host cavity, but may be overwhelmed by other effects such as high-energy water release (DOI:10.1002/chem.201605394, DOI:10.1039/D0QO00649A).', 'The hydrophobic effect is a major driving force for molecular recognition in water, favoring the aggregation of nonpolar guests and exclusion of water molecules from the host cavity; this effect is entropically favored and can be complemented by ion-dipole interactions (DOI:10.1021/ja0727058, DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Molecular complementarity—matching of host cavity size, shape, and functional group orientation to the guest—critically influences binding specificity and efficiency (DOI:10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Solvent effects, particularly the use of water or D2O, significantly modulate the strength and nature of host-guest interactions, as shown by changes in binding affinity and enthalpy/entropy profiles (DOI:10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081, DOI:10.1021/jacs.6b04372).', 'Thermodynamic parameters—enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and free energy (ΔG)—quantitatively determine the favorability and mechanism of complex formation; most host-guest complexation processes are enthalpy-driven due to displacement of high-energy water, with ΔH values for binding ranging from -4.22 to -14.31 kcal mol⁻¹ (DOI:10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', "Stoichiometry of host-guest complexes is typically 1:1, but can vary (e.g., 1:2, 1:3) depending on the system, and is determined by methods such as Job's plot, fluorescence titration, and mol ratio plot (DOI:10.1002/chem.201605394, DOI:10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.05.009).", 'Host-guest interactions are studied and quantified using techniques such as 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (DOI:10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107919).'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest chemistry is a subfield of supramolecular chemistry focused on the non-covalent binding of a host molecule (e.g., cryptand, cyclodextrin, cucurbituril) with a guest molecule (e.g., organic compound, peptide, ion), forming inclusion complexes with defined stoichiometry and selectivity.', 'Molecular recognition is the process by which host and guest molecules interact and bind with high specificity, often involving macrocyclic hosts (e.g., calixarenes, crown ethers, cucurbiturils) and driven by a combination of non-covalent interactions and molecular complementarity.', 'The hydrophobic effect is particularly significant in aqueous environments, where the exclusion of water from the host cavity upon guest binding leads to entropically favored complexation; this effect is less pronounced or reversed in organic solvents (DOI:10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02541).', 'Hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions are validated and characterized by computational methods (e.g., DFT calculations), atoms-in-molecules analysis, and reduced density gradient analysis (DOI:10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'The selectivity and binding strength of host-guest systems can be modulated by structural features such as cavity size, rigid cone conformation, and the presence of specific functional groups (e.g., triazine rings, carbonyl portals).', 'Thermodynamic analysis (ITC) reveals that complexation is often enthalpy-driven due to the release of high-energy water from the host cavity, with entropy changes (TΔS) being less favorable or even negative in some cases.', 'Solvent effects are evaluated using models such as the polarizable continuum model (PCM), and can significantly alter the binding energetics and selectivity of host-guest systems (DOI:10.1021/jacs.6b04372).', 'Host-guest interactions are relevant for applications in molecular machines, biomaterials, drug delivery, and selective molecular separations, with ongoing research focusing on optimizing binding specificity and affinity through supramolecular design.'], 'relationships': ['Hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, electrostatic, hydrophobic, and π-π stacking interactions act cooperatively or competitively to determine the overall binding affinity and selectivity of host-guest complexes.', 'Molecular recognition efficiency is influenced by the complementarity between host and guest, as well as by environmental factors such as solvent polarity and ionic strength.', 'Thermodynamic parameters (ΔH, ΔS, ΔG) are interdependent and collectively define the spontaneity and mechanism of host-guest complexation; enthalpy-entropy compensation is commonly observed.', 'Solvent effects can modulate the relative contributions of different non-covalent interactions, shifting the balance between enthalpy and entropy in complex formation.', 'Stoichiometry is determined by the relative concentrations and affinities of host and guest, and can be influenced by charge compensation and mixing ratio.', 'Experimental and computational methods are used in tandem to elucidate the structural and energetic basis of host-guest interactions, enabling rational design of supramolecular systems.']}
