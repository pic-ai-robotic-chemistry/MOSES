{'summary': 'No direct data regarding the stability or reproducibility of electrochemical sensors using an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) for quinine detection was found in the queried sources.', 'key_points': ['The ontology query returned no specific information, quantitative data, or technical specifications related to the stability, sensor stability, reproducibility, or sensor reproducibility of electrochemical sensors employing an indicator displacement assay for quinine detection.', 'No analytical performance metrics, such as relative standard deviation (RSD), signal drift, operational lifetime, or inter-assay variability, were reported for the IDA-based electrochemical sensor targeting quinine.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular analytical technique often used for selective detection of analytes, including alkaloids like quinine, by exploiting competitive binding events that result in measurable signal changes.', 'Electrochemical sensors are widely used for quantitative detection of small molecules due to their sensitivity and potential for miniaturization; however, their analytical performance (including stability and reproducibility) is highly dependent on sensor design, surface chemistry, and assay conditions.', 'Stability in the context of electrochemical sensors typically refers to the ability of the sensor to maintain consistent response over time, under repeated use, or during storage, while reproducibility refers to the consistency of sensor response across multiple measurements or sensor batches.'], 'relationships': ['No explicit or implicit relationships, dependencies, or patterns regarding the stability or reproducibility of IDA-based electrochemical sensors for quinine detection were identified in the available data.']}
