{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) can detect a wide range of molecules, including small organic molecules, post-translationally modified peptides (such as trimethylated lysine), drugs, anions, metal ions, and biomolecules, depending on the host, indicator, and assay design.', 'key_points': ['IDAs detect molecules (analytes) that can competitively bind to a host molecule, displacing an indicator dye and generating a measurable signal.', 'Specific examples of detectable molecules include caffeine (selectivity demonstrated), trimethylated lysine (detected using deep cavitand as recognition element), and lysine methylation states (mono-, di-, and trimethylated lysine).', 'The assay can be applied in complex environments such as lipid membrane constructs and living cells (10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Host molecules used in IDAs include deep cavitands, carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene (WP6), and other macrocyclic receptors, which enable recognition of diverse analytes.', 'Indicator dyes used include lucigenin and dye_28, which are displaced upon analyte binding (10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'The ontology lists a vast array of molecules as potential analytes, including amino acids (e.g., L-lysine, arginine, tryptophan), peptides (e.g., tripeptides, histone tails), small organic molecules (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, acetylcholine), drugs (e.g., cocaine, MDMA), anions, cations, and biomolecules (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates).'], 'background_information': ["Indicator displacement assays are analytical techniques where a host molecule binds an indicator dye; displacement of the dye by a guest (analyte) is used to detect the analyte's presence.", 'IDAs are particularly useful for detecting post-translational modifications in proteins, such as methylation of lysine residues, and for differential sensing of small molecules (e.g., LPA, caffeine).', 'The selectivity and sensitivity of IDAs depend on the choice of host, indicator, and assay conditions, allowing for ultrasensitive and specific detection in biological and chemical environments.', 'The method is a subclass of pattern-based sensing and reporting element techniques, enabling multiplexed and high-throughput detection schemes (10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'IDAs have been used to measure binding affinities of host-guest complexes under various conditions, providing quantitative information about molecular recognition.'], 'relationships': ['The host molecule (e.g., deep cavitand, carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene) serves as the recognition element, binding both the indicator dye and the analyte in a competitive fashion.', 'Displacement of the indicator dye by the analyte produces a measurable optical signal, which is the basis for detection.', "The selectivity of the assay for specific analytes (e.g., caffeine, trimethylated lysine) is determined by the host's binding affinity and the competitive displacement mechanism.", "The assay's applicability in lipid membrane constructs and living cells demonstrates its utility for in situ and biological sensing applications (10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).", "The ontology's extensive list of molecules (including amino acids, peptides, drugs, and biomolecules) reflects the broad analyte scope accessible by IDA, contingent on the host-indicator system employed."]}
