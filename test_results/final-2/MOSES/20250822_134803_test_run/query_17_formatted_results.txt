{'summary': 'Cage molecules and macrocycles are both central to supramolecular chemistry, with overlapping applications in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, catalysis, drug delivery, and sensing, but they differ in structural features and specific application profiles. Macrocycles are more broadly utilized as supramolecular hosts and receptors, while cage molecules (including molecular cages and capsules) are specialized for molecular encapsulation and selective guest accommodation.', 'key_points': ['Macrocycles (including macrocyclic hosts, receptors, and compounds) are widely applied in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, catalysis, drug delivery, chemosensing, fluorescence switching, nanotechnology, separation, and supramolecular dye lasers.', 'Macrocyclic hosts form host-guest complexes with a wide range of guests (aromatic guests, drugs, proteins, metal ions, biomolecules) and are used as artificial receptors, with applications in biologically relevant work, catalysis, chemosensing, and molecular delivery.', 'Macrocyclic receptors are crucial for biomedical applications, drug delivery, drug design, and biochemical sensing, enabling molecular recognition of amino acids, peptides, proteins, and ions via hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, ion-dipole, and van der Waals interactions.', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies are used for bioimaging, light-harvesting energy transfer, photodynamic therapy (PDT), targeted drug delivery, and topological morphology control, often exhibiting stimulus responsiveness.', 'Cage molecules (including molecular cages and capsules) are specialized for molecular encapsulation, accommodating specific guests (e.g., aromatic compounds, indole rings, methyl groups), and are used in selective guest binding and encapsulation processes.', 'Both macrocycles and cage molecules participate in supramolecular host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, catalysis, and drug delivery, indicating significant overlap in application domains.', 'Macrocycles are integrated into nanostructures and sensing scaffolds, and can be functionalized for enhanced solubility, binding affinity, and selectivity (e.g., via solubilizing groups, cationic groups, hydrogen bonding units, aromatic components).', 'Macrocyclic compounds and hosts are building blocks for supramolecular aggregates and assemblies, contributing to the construction of complex molecular architectures.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular chemistry, the overarching field, focuses on noncovalent interactions, self-assembly, and host-guest molecular recognition systems, with macrocycles and cages as key molecular architectures.', 'Host-guest chemistry is a subfield of supramolecular chemistry, with macrocycles (e.g., cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, calixarenes, pillararenes) and cages serving as hosts for a variety of guest molecules, including drugs, biomolecules, and ions.', 'Molecular recognition in aqueous environments is governed by electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic effects, ion-dipole interactions, and is influenced by cavity size and conformation rigidity; macrocyclic receptors are primary agents in this process.', 'Macrocycles are classified as artificial hosts, synthetic receptors, and functional materials, and are used as research tools, sensors, and fluorescent/ratiometric probes in chemical and biological contexts.', 'Macrocyclic hosts have subtypes such as calixarene, cucurbituril, cyclodextrin, cyclophane derivative, pillararene, and triazine-based hosts, each with specific guest selectivity and application profiles.', 'Cage molecules, including coordination cages (e.g., Fe8L6 cubic coordination cage, Fujita Pd6L4 cage) and molecular capsules, are often constructed via self-assembly and are central to studies of molecular encapsulation and selective guest binding.', 'Macrocyclic systems are developed to improve chemotherapy drugs, and macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies are key in advanced drug delivery and photodynamic therapy.', 'Analytical techniques for studying host-guest interactions include fluorescence spectroscopy, 1H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and UV-Vis spectroscopy.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles and cage molecules both function as supramolecular hosts, but macrocycles are more broadly diversified in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and as building blocks for supramolecular assemblies, while cages are more specialized for encapsulation and selective guest accommodation.', 'Macrocyclic hosts and receptors are directly involved in molecular recognition, drug delivery, and catalysis, often through noncovalent interactions and cavity-based selectivity, paralleling the encapsulation function of cage molecules.', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies and cage molecules both exploit self-assembly and noncovalent interactions, but macrocyclic assemblies are more frequently used in light-harvesting, bioimaging, and photodynamic therapy.', 'There is significant overlap in the use of macrocycles and cages in drug delivery, catalysis, and molecular recognition, with both architectures enabling selective binding and transport of guest molecules.', 'Macrocycles can be functionalized or modified to enhance their host properties, solubility, and selectivity, while cages are often designed for specific guest encapsulation based on size and shape complementarity.']}
