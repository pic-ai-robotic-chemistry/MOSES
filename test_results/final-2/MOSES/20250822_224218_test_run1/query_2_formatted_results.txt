{'summary': 'An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular analytical technique in which an indicator dye, initially bound to a host molecule, is competitively displaced by an analyte, resulting in a measurable signal that enables detection and quantification of the analyte.', 'key_points': ['IDA is a sensing method where a dye (indicator) is displaced from a host molecule by an analyte, producing a measurable signal (e.g., optical or fluorescence change).', 'The mechanism relies on competitive binding: the host molecule forms a complex with an indicator dye; introduction of an analyte with higher affinity for the host displaces the indicator, altering the signal.', 'Indicator displacement assays are used to detect post-translational modifications in proteins, such as trimethylated lysine (DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F), and for ultrasensitive detection of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and caffeine.', 'IDA can be performed in lipid membrane constructs and living cells (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost), and is compatible with live-cell and intracellular sensing.', 'Common host molecules and recognition elements include carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6), safranine T (ST), deep cavitand, beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), poly(N-acetylaniline), and graphene.', 'Typical indicator dyes include lucigenin and dye_28 (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'IDA is highly compatible with differential sensing strategies, allowing construction of sensor arrays by combining multiple receptors and indicators (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'The interaction type in IDA is non-covalent, and the sensor output is often optical (e.g., fluorescence).', 'IDA is selective for specific analytes, such as caffeine, and can distinguish caffeine from structurally similar compounds like theophylline and theobromine.', 'IDA is a subclass of pattern-based sensing and reporting element methodologies, and is a technique within supramolecular analytical chemistry.'], 'background_information': ['Fluorescent Indicator Displacement Assay (F-IDA) is a subtype of IDA that utilizes fluorescence as the signal output, offering high selectivity (e.g., for caffeine over theophylline and theobromine) and large signal modulation.', 'Competitive binding assays, including IDA, are standard strategies in molecular sensing with synthetic receptors, and are complementary to direct sensing approaches (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Competitive binding titrations, often performed in water, quantitatively assess host-guest inclusion complexation using fluorescence spectroscopy (DOI: 10.1021/jo502825z).', 'IDA is used in supramolecular analytical chemistry and is particularly suited for differential sensing, where sensor arrays can be constructed for pattern recognition of multiple analytes.', 'IDA can target a wide range of analytes, including metal cations, anions, drugs, and biological molecules, and is applicable for monitoring targets such as hypoxia in live cells.', 'The indicator displacement principle is also used in molecular recognition and intracellular sensing.'], 'relationships': ['IDA involves a host-guest system where the host binds an indicator dye; the analyte competes for the host, displacing the indicator and modulating the signal.', 'IDA is applied for detection of trimethylated lysine, caffeine, and LPA, and is selective for caffeine over theophylline and theobromine.', 'Host molecules (e.g., WP6, deep cavitand, beta-CD) and indicator dyes (e.g., lucigenin, dye_28) are key components; the choice of host and indicator determines selectivity and sensitivity.', 'IDA is integrated with differential sensing, enabling sensor arrays for complex analyte discrimination (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'IDA is a technique within supramolecular analytical chemistry and is related to competitive binding assays and fluorescence-based titrations.', 'IDA is performed in diverse environments, including lipid membrane constructs and live cells, and is compatible with optical sensor outputs.']}
