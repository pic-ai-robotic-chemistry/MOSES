{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are capable of detecting a wide range of analytes, including small molecules, peptides, proteins, metal ions, and various anions, with demonstrated selectivity for specific bioorganic and inorganic targets.', 'key_points': ['IDAs detect trimethylated_lysine (DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F), and are applied for caffeine_sensing.', 'Analyte classes detectable by IDA include: amino_acids (e.g., L_lysine, L_arginine, L_histidine, L_tryptophan), post_translationally_modified_amino_acids (e.g., monomethyllysine, dimethyllysine, trimethyllysine), peptides (e.g., H3_histone_tail, acetylated_histone_h4kac, alpha-synuclein), proteins (e.g., histone, cytochrome_c, myoglobin, insulin), small organic molecules (e.g., acetylcholine, glucose, doxorubicin), metal ions (e.g., cu_ii, fe_iii), and a broad spectrum of anions (e.g., chloride_ion(Cl-), bromide_ion(Br-), iodide_ion(I-), sulfate_anion, phosphate_anion, perchlorate_ion(ClO4-), perrhenate_ion(ReO4-), thiocyanate_ion(SCN-), oxalate(c2o4)2-, hexafluorophosphate_ion(PF6-)).', 'IDAs are capable of detecting post-translational modifications in proteins, such as methylation and acetylation, and can be used for ultrasensitive and specific detection of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA).', 'Assay locations include lipid membrane constructs and living cells (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'IDAs utilize host molecules such as carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene(WP6) and deep_cavitand as recognition elements, and indicator dyes such as lucigenin and dye_28 (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assays are analytical techniques in which a host molecule binds to an indicator dye; displacement of the dye by a guest (analyte) produces a measurable signal.', 'IDAs are a subclass of pattern_based_sensing and reporting_element methodologies, enabling differential sensing and high selectivity for specific analytes.', 'Anion_binding, relevant to IDA, is mediated by sigma_hole_interaction, enabled by hydrophobic_concavity, and studied by molecular_dynamics_simulation.', 'IDAs have been used to measure the affinity of host-guest complexes under various conditions, providing quantitative information on analyte binding.'], 'relationships': ['IDAs detect a broad spectrum of analytes, including small_molecule, peptide, protein, metal_ion, and anion classes, with demonstrated selectivity for specific targets such as trimethylated_lysine and caffeine.', 'Recognition elements (e.g., deep_cavitand, carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene(WP6)) and indicator dyes (e.g., lucigenin, dye_28) are essential components of IDA systems, determining the range and specificity of detectable analytes.', 'Anion_binding, a key mechanism in IDA, is mediated by sigma_hole_interaction and hydrophobic_concavity, which influence the selectivity and sensitivity of the assay.', 'The application of IDA in lipid membrane constructs and living cells extends its utility to biologically relevant environments, enabling detection of bioorganic analytes in situ.']}
