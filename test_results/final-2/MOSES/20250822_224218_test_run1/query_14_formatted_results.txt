{'summary': 'Macrocycles encompass a diverse class of cyclic compounds, including calixarenes, cyclodextrins, cyclophanes, porphyrins, cryptands, and crown ethers, each with distinct structural features and functional properties. Specific examples include calixarene_1, beta_cyclodextrin, cyclophane_1a, porphyrin_tweezer_system, and tetrasulfonated_crown_ether, among others.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes: calixarene_1, calixarene_6, and calixarene_14 are macrocyclic hosts with high selectivity and affinity for methylated lysine residues and histone peptides. Calixarene_1 exhibits a dissociation constant of 28 µM for cytochrome_c and selectivity of 71 for trimethyllysine (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398). Calixarene_6 shows an affinity of 16 μM for trimethyllysine and selectivity of 150 (trimethyllysine), dropping to 25 (Kme0/Kmex). Calixarene_14 is linked to agarose beads and used in supramolecular affinity chromatography.', 'Cyclodextrins: beta_cyclodextrin and gamma-cyclodextrin are cyclic oligosaccharides with large cavities. Beta_cyclodextrin can be grafted with octyl or dodecyl groups and undergoes self-assembly (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2019.111656). Gamma-cyclodextrin has high binding affinity for anions and plays a role in water structure recovery (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259). Cyclodextrin_3 contains hydrogen-bond donor groups and exhibits weaker binding affinity than per-methylated_alpha-cyclodextrin_4 for benzoic acid, phenol derivatives, and anions.', 'Cyclophanes: cyclophane_1a contains a coumarin moiety, is cationic, water-soluble, and exhibits fluorescence changes upon binding various proteins (e.g., myoglobin, albumins, lysozyme). It has binding affinities of 1.5e5 M^-1 for myoglobin, 8.1e3 M^-1 for 1,8-ANS, and 5.9e3 M^-1 for 2,6-ANS (DOI: 10.1007/s10847-015-0546-3).
