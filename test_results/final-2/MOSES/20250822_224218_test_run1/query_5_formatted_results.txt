{'summary': 'Electrochemical sensors constructed using the Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) methodology are used for the detection of quinine, with evidence of high selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. These sensors leverage nanocomposite materials and are validated by advanced electrochemical techniques such as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).', 'key_points': ['Electrochemical sensors have been constructed by the indicator displacement assay (IDA) and are used for the detection of quinine.', "These sensors are based on nanocomposite materials, as indicated by the restriction 'is_based_on: nanocomposite' (DOI: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).", 'Detection and quantification of quinine are verified by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H_NMR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).', 'Performance metrics for these sensors include: superior selectivity over common interfering molecules, good reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven identical electrodes), high stability (86.47% of original DPV signal value retained up to 21 days; negligible change in DPV signal during first 7 days at 4°C), and cost-effectiveness.', 'Repeatability is demonstrated by five independent electrodes displaying similar signals when detecting 30 μM quinine.', 'The sensors are described as simple, reusable, and possessing reasonable accuracy and precision (DOI: 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Quinine is used as the target analyte, with a stock solution concentration of 10 mM in ethanol, typically diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS), and an incubation time of 40 min.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular sensing strategy based on non-covalent interactions, often involving synthetic receptors and indicators, and is capable of sensor conversion for various analytes including drugs such as quinine.', 'IDA can be coupled with differential sensing and is performed in diverse environments, including live cells. Components such as beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD), poly(N-acetylaniline), and graphene are commonly used.', 'Quinine is an alkaloid derived from cinchona tree bark, with low solubility in water and hydrophobic character. It is used for malaria, lupus, arthritis, muscle cramp, and as a bittering agent.', 'Quinine detection is also performed by other methods such as electrochemiluminescence biosensor, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), quantitative electrochemical methods, colorimetric assay, fluorescence assay, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).', 'In IDA-based systems, quinine forms a 1:1 molar ratio complex with β-CD, and its detection is associated with a slight proton peak shift.'], 'relationships': ['Electrochemical sensors constructed by IDA are directly linked to the detection of quinine, with the IDA providing the molecular recognition and signal transduction mechanism.', 'The use of nanocomposite materials in the sensor platform enhances the electrochemical properties and stability of the sensor.', 'DPV is both a verification and quantification method for quinine in these sensor systems, ensuring analytical reliability.', "IDA's non-covalent interaction mechanism allows for reversible and selective detection of quinine, contributing to the sensor's reusability and selectivity.", 'The inclusion of β-CD as a component in IDA-based sensors facilitates host-guest interactions with quinine, supporting the indicator displacement mechanism.']}
