{'summary': 'The principal types of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions are calixarenes (notably sulfonatocalix[n]arenes), cyclophanes, cucurbiturils, and pillararene derivatives, with calixarenes and cyclophanes being especially prominent for cation-π recognition.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes, especially sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4), calix[6]arene, and their derivatives, are established supramolecular hosts that bind cationic guests (e.g., methylated lysine, methylated arginine) primarily via cation-π interactions involving the aromatic panels of their cavities.', 'Cyclophanes, including cationic cyclophane derivatives and pyrene-based cyclophanes, are designed to present aromatic surfaces for strong cation-π binding of ammonium and other cationic guests.', 'Cucurbiturils (notably cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) and cucurbit[8]uril (CB8)) are macrocyclic hosts whose binding pockets can engage cationic guests through cation-π interactions, particularly with methylated amino acid side chains.', 'Pillararenes, especially cationic pillar[5]arene, pillar[6]arene, and pillar[7]arene derivatives, are capable of cation-π recognition due to their electron-rich aromatic cavities.', 'Cation-π interactions in these hosts are typically directed toward methylated amino acid side chains (e.g., methyllysine, methylarginine), with selectivity for methylation state and strong binding affinity (sufficient to out-compete native reader proteins in some cases).', 'Specific host examples with documented cation-π interactions include calixarene_1, calixarene_6, calixarene_12, trivalent_receptor_13, and hosts with aromatic panels in their cavities (as per ontology relationships).'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts that utilize cation-π interactions are often inspired by natural methyl reader proteins, which use aromatic residues in their binding pockets to recognize methylated lysine and arginine via cation-π contacts (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'These hosts are designed for selective recognition of posttranslationally methylated partners, including methylated amino acids, peptides, and proteins, with discrimination based on methylation state being a required property.', 'Binding affinity to unmethylated amino acids is typically weak, while affinity to methylated targets is strong, often sufficient to out-compete native reader proteins.', 'Applications include use as sequestration agents, pan-specific reagents, and tools for chemical biology and biochemistry, particularly in physiologically relevant media (e.g., warm, salty water).', 'The interaction surface area of these synthetic hosts is smaller than that of proteins, but they can achieve high selectivity and strong binding through optimized cation-π contacts.', 'Cation-π interactions are evaluated by the presence of n_chx_fragments and occur between the aromatic panel of the host cavity and the cationic side chain of the guest.'], 'relationships': ['Cation-π interactions are the primary non-covalent force mediating host-guest binding in calixarenes, cyclophanes, cucurbiturils, and pillararenes, especially for recognition of methylated lysine and arginine side chains.', 'Calixarene hosts (e.g., calixarene_1, calixarene_6, calixarene_12) and trivalent_receptor_13 have documented cation-π interactions with methylated lysine and methylated arginine, as well as with hydroquinone groups and aromatic panels of the cavity.', "The selectivity for methylation state and strong binding affinity are directly linked to the ability of the host's aromatic cavity to engage in cation-π interactions with the guest's cationic moiety.", 'These hosts are compared to natural protein counterparts (e.g., methyl reader proteins) in terms of selectivity, binding affinity, and competition for methylated targets.', 'The design and function of these hosts are inspired by nature, aiming to mimic the cation-π recognition motifs found in biological systems.']}
