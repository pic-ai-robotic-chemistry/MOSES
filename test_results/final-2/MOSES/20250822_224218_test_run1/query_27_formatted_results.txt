{'summary': 'Host-guest interactions are primarily governed by non-covalent forces—including the hydrophobic effect, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions, and solvent effects—along with structural and thermodynamic parameters that collectively determine binding affinity and selectivity.', 'key_points': ['Non-covalent interactions (hydrophobic effect, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions, and π-π stacking) are the principal forces controlling host-guest interaction.', 'The hydrophobic effect is a dominant driving force for molecular association and recognition in aqueous solution, with binding affinities of guests for β-cyclodextrin and other macrocycles mainly driven by this effect (DOI: 10.1021/ja0727058).', 'Hydrogen bonding stabilizes host-guest complexes, with measured hydrogen bond distances in the range of 2.508–2.968 Å (DOI: 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028). Hydrogen bonds are most relevant for selectivity and are enabled by polar solvents such as water and methanol.', 'Van der Waals interactions are among the most relevant for selectivity, contributing to favorable enthalpy changes (ΔH) and stabilization of complexes, especially in hosts with polarizable, saturated nonpolar pockets (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Electrostatic interactions, while sometimes overwhelmed by other effects, are primary drivers for guest location and can be extremely sensitive to environmental conditions (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201605394). They are less relevant for selectivity compared to hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions.', 'Binding affinity is determined by the interplay of hydrophobicity (which often dominates over electrostatics), sequence dependence, ionic strength, and solvent effects. Binding stoichiometry is typically 1:1, and affinity can be measured by ITC, fluorescence displacement models, and NMR titration (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6b04372; 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Selectivity is influenced by the combined effects of electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, and hydrogen bonds, and is quantified as the ratio of binding or activity between different guest states (e.g., Kme0/Kme3; DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Solvent effects, particularly the presence of water, modulate the strength and nature of host-guest interactions, often weakening binding in polar environments (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6b04372).', 'Thermodynamic parameters, including enthalpic (ΔH) and entropic contributions, are critical in characterizing and understanding host-guest binding processes.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest interaction is a form of molecular recognition involving the binding of a guest molecule within the cavity of a host, such as cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8), β-cyclodextrin, or synthetic macrocycles, and is central to supramolecular chemistry.', 'Molecular recognition is governed by weak, non-covalent interactions and is influenced by factors such as cavity size, rigid cone conformation, and the presence of substitution groups (e.g., triazine ring).', 'Hydrophobic effect refers to the tendency of nonpolar substances to aggregate in aqueous solution, excluding water molecules, and is entropically favored. It is complemented by ion-dipole interactions and influenced by molecular shape and the presence of apolar chains (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Hydrogen bonds are validated by atoms-in-molecules analysis and reduced density gradients analysis, and are formed between specific donor and acceptor groups (e.g., pyridine NH binding site and carbonyl oxygen atom).', 'Van der Waals interactions involve the inner wall of macrocyclic hosts and guest surfaces, contributing to anion binding, protein denaturation, and Hofmeister effects.', 'Electrostatic interactions occur between charged groups (e.g., lysine residue and sulfonate group) and are evaluated by DFT calculations. They are subject to entropic cancellation with solute-solvent reorganization entropy.', 'Binding affinity is sequence-dependent and can be decreased by specific modifications (e.g., glycine insertion) or influenced by environmental conditions such as acidity and ionic strength. Affinity drops off at van der Waals length scales (DOI: 10.1021/ja0727058).', 'Selectivity is measured by NMR and fluorescence displacement assays, and can be affected by interfering molecules.', 'Solvent effects are evaluated using models such as the polarizable continuum model (PCM), and can be critical in modulating host-guest complexation, especially in aqueous environments.', 'Thermodynamics provides the framework for understanding the energetic contributions (enthalpy, entropy) to host-guest binding.'], 'relationships': ['Hydrophobic effect, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals interactions are the most relevant contributors to selectivity in host-guest systems, with electrostatic interactions playing a secondary role (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Hydrophobic effect is complemented by ion-dipole interactions and is increased by the presence of apolar chains; it is relative to the solvent environment (water vs. organic solvent).', 'Hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions stabilize host-guest complexes and are critical for high selectivity and affinity.', 'Electrostatic interactions are highly sensitive to environmental conditions and can be modulated by solvent polarity and ionic strength.', 'Binding affinity and selectivity are interdependent and are both influenced by the balance of non-covalent interactions, solvent effects, and thermodynamic parameters.', 'Solvent effects modulate the relative contributions of hydrophobic, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions, often attenuating binding in highly polar environments.', 'Thermodynamic analysis (ΔH, entropy) is essential for dissecting the contributions of different non-covalent interactions to overall binding.']}
