{'summary': 'There is no direct evidence in the provided ontology data for the existence of calixarene derivatives featuring pyrrole functional groups as supramolecular hosts. However, the data confirm that calixarene derivatives are a broad and highly derivatizable class of supramolecular hosts, but pyrrole substitution is not explicitly listed among known substituents.', 'key_points': ['Calixarene derivatives (calixarene_derivative) are confirmed as supramolecular hosts and are derived from calixarene (CA).', 'Calixarene derivatives are known to possess a wide range of substituents, including carbamoyl (CONH2), cyano (CN), methoxy (MeO), and phenyl ring groups (10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'No explicit mention of pyrrole or pyrrole functional group as a substituent or functional group on calixarene derivatives is present in the ontology data.', 'Calixarene derivatives are used in life science applications and are capable of binding guests such as trimethyllysine (Kme3).', "Calixarenes and their derivatives are highly modifiable, with 'almost unlimited' derivatization capability (10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4), and can be functionalized at both upper and lower rims, but pyrrole is not specifically listed among the functional groups or substituents."], 'background_information': ['Calixarenes are macrocyclic synthetic receptors with a bowl-shaped hydrophobic cavity, widely used as supramolecular hosts in host-guest chemistry (10.1002/cbic.201800398; 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Calixarene derivatives can be rendered water-soluble by introduction of hydrophilic groups at the upper or lower rim (10.1002/ejoc.201601663).', 'Calixarene derivatives are used for selective recognition and binding of biomolecules, including methylated lysine and trimethyllysine (Kme3), and are applied in chemical biology and biochemistry (10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', "The derivatization of calixarenes is described as 'almost unlimited,' allowing for a wide range of chemical modifications, though the ontology only lists certain substituents (10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).", 'Calixarene-based supramolecular hosts are easier to modify than macrocyclic cucurbiturils and are fully addressable for functionalization (10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).'], 'relationships': ['Calixarene_derivative is a subclass of calixarene and is used as a supramolecular host, with established applications in life sciences and selective molecular recognition.', 'Calixarene derivatives are functionally linked to the binding of trimethyllysine (Kme3) and are derived from calixarene (CA).', "The ontology lists specific substituents for calixarene derivatives but does not include pyrrole, indicating either a lack of such derivatives in the curated data or omission from the ontology's current scope.", 'Calixarenes are structurally and functionally related to other macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cavitands), and their derivatization is a key feature for tuning host-guest properties.']}
