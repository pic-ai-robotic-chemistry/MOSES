{'summary': 'The principal host molecules that utilize host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays are macrocyclic hosts, specifically β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), calixarenes, and cucurbiturils (notably CB7 and CB8). These hosts form inclusion complexes with guest molecules, enabling selective molecular recognition and signal transduction in electrochemical sensor platforms.', 'key_points': ['β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a macrocyclic host molecule that forms 1:1 inclusion complexes with guest molecules such as methylene blue (MB) and quinine, and is directly integrated into electrochemical sensors and assays for molecular recognition (e.g., quinine determination).', 'Calixarenes (including calixarene_1, calixarene_6, calixarene_14) are macrocyclic phenolic compounds with hydrophobic cavities, used as host molecules for selective recognition of biomolecules (e.g., methylated lysine, peptides) and drugs in electrochemical sensor applications. Calixarenes exhibit high affinity and selectivity (e.g., calixarene_6: 16 μM affinity, selectivity 150 for trimethyllysine).', 'Cucurbiturils, especially cucurbituril_7 (CB7) and cucurbituril_8 (CB8), are macrocyclic hosts that form strong, selective host-guest complexes with amino acids, peptides, and dyes (e.g., MB), and are used in electrochemical sensors for analyte detection (e.g., tryptophan, peptides). CB8 can simultaneously include two neighboring side chains or residues, enabling nanomolar affinity for tripeptides (e.g., Tyr-Leu-Ala).', 'Host-guest recognition in electrochemical assays is often realized via indicator displacement assays (IDA), where the host (e.g., β-CD, CB8) binds a reporter dye (e.g., MB), and analyte binding displaces the dye, modulating the electrochemical signal.', 'Macrocyclic hosts (cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils) are frequently immobilized on electrode surfaces (e.g., β-CD on reduced graphene oxide glassy carbon electrodes) to create selective, reusable, and stable electrochemical sensors with high reproducibility and selectivity for target analytes.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest recognition is a selective, non-covalent interaction between a host molecule (macrocycle) and a guest molecule, central to supramolecular chemistry and molecular sensing.', 'Macrocyclic hosts possess hydrophobic cavities (e.g., β-CD: 7 glucopyranose units, calixarenes: bowl-shaped, cucurbiturils: rigid, symmetric) that enable selective encapsulation of guest molecules via hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonding, and ion-dipole interactions.', 'Electrochemical sensors based on host-guest recognition are verified by techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and are constructed using nanocomposites and indicator displacement strategies.', 'Calixarenes are easily synthesized, highly modifiable, and can be derivatized for enhanced selectivity and solubility. They are used for drug detection, biomolecule recognition, and as platforms for sensor applications (e.g., affinity pull-down, supramolecular affinity chromatography).', 'Cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8) exhibit sequence-dependent binding affinity for peptides and can form complexes with high selectivity for N-terminal aromatic residues (CB7) or simultaneous inclusion of two neighboring residues (CB8). CB8-based supramolecular switches and complexes with 1:1 or 2:1 stoichiometry are used in advanced sensing platforms.', 'Cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and cucurbiturils are compared for their solubility, cavity size, and binding affinity. Cyclodextrins are classical, water-soluble macrocyclic hosts with high usage frequency in pharmaceutical and food science applications, but generally weaker peptide binding compared to cucurbiturils.', 'Host-guest interactions are characterized and quantified by methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), NMR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations, providing association constants (Ka), binding free energies, and thermodynamic parameters.'], 'relationships': ['β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is directly integrated with electrochemical sensors and assays via host-guest recognition with methylene blue (MB) and quinine, enabling selective electrochemical detection (DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'Calixarenes form host-guest complexes with peptides, drugs, and methylated lysines, and are used as platforms for sensor applications, including affinity pull-down and supramolecular affinity chromatography (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8) form strong, selective complexes with amino acids and peptides, with CB8 capable of simultaneous inclusion of two neighboring residues, leading to nanomolar affinity for tripeptides (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479).', 'Host-guest recognition is realized in electrochemical assays via indicator displacement assays (IDA), where the host binds a reporter dye (e.g., MB), and analyte binding displaces the dye, modulating the electrochemical signal.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are immobilized on electrode surfaces (e.g., β-CD on reduced graphene oxide glassy carbon electrodes) to create stable, reusable, and selective electrochemical sensors with high reproducibility and selectivity for target analytes.', 'Host-guest recognition in supramolecular chemistry is a subfield of molecular recognition, and is studied using a range of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques to quantify binding affinity and selectivity.']}
