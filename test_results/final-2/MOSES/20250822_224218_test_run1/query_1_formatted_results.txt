{'summary': 'Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid derived from cinchona tree bark, primarily used as an antimalarial agent, with additional applications in treating lupus, arthritis, muscle cramps, and as a bittering agent. It exhibits low solubility in water, is typically prepared as a 10 mM stock solution in ethanol, and can induce significant adverse health effects at toxic doses.', 'key_points': ['Quinine is classified as an alkaloid and is a component of cinchona tree bark.', 'Primary applications: treatment of malaria, lupus, arthritis, muscle cramps, and as a bittering agent.', 'Stock solution concentration: 10 mM (in ethanol); working solutions are diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS).', 'Solubility in water: low; hydrophobic character.', 'Molar ratio with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD): 1:1, indicating inclusion complex formation.', 'Recovery rates in analytical methods: 98.3% to 109.3%.', 'Quinine is detected and quantified using quantitative electrochemical methods, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), electrochemiluminescence biosensors, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), colorimetric assays, fluorescence assays, and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).', 'Proton NMR: slight proton peak shift observed upon complexation.', 'Adverse health effects: thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, blindness, acute kidney injury.', 'Quinine poisoning is directly caused by quinine exposure.'], 'background_information': ['Quinine is a hydrophobic molecule with low water solubility, which can be enhanced by macrocyclic hosts such as β-cyclodextrin, forming a 1:1 inclusion complex.', 'In detection schemes, quinine serves as the target analyte and is analyzed by a variety of electrochemical and chromatographic techniques.', 'The quinolinium ring is a structural motif present in quinine and related guest molecules, characterized as a heterocyclic aromatic structure with extended aromatic character, delocalized positive charge, and strong π-π interaction capabilities (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2019.111656).', 'Quinolinium moieties and their alkyl chain positions influence the self-organization and internal structure of nanoparticles, relevant in drug delivery and supramolecular assembly contexts.', 'Drug carriers such as cyclodextrin derivatives, hydrogels, nanoparticles, and water-soluble calixarene derivatives are used to solubilize, stabilize, and target the delivery of small-molecule therapeutics like quinine.', 'Quinine is a member of the broader isoquinoline alkaloid class, which are often used as indicators and have diverse biological activities.', 'Quinine concentration in analytical applications ranges from 0 nM to 125 μM, affecting reduction peak current and ΔI_MB in electrochemical detection.', 'Quinine is a hydrophobic drug whose solubility and stability can be enhanced by encapsulation in functional nanomaterials or adsorption on carrier matrices.'], 'relationships': ['Quinine is a direct descendant of the alkaloid class and a component of cinchona tree bark.', 'β-Quinine is a derivative of quinine.', 'Quinine is used for malaria, lupus, arthritis, muscle cramps, and as a bittering agent.', 'Quinine is detected by quantitative electrochemical methods, ion transfer voltammetry, and electrochemiluminescence biosensors; it is determined by differential pulse voltammetry and analyzed by HPLC, colorimetric, fluorescence, and HRMS techniques.', 'Quinine induces adverse health effects including thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, blindness, and acute kidney injury.', 'Quinine poisoning is directly caused by quinine.', 'Quinolinium moieties, present in quinine, exhibit more extended aromatic character, more delocalized positive charge, and stronger π-π interactions than imidazolium (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2019.111656).', 'Drug carriers target both small-molecule and macromolecular therapeutics, with functions including solubilization, stabilization, and targeted delivery.']}
