{'summary': 'Guest molecules in supramolecular host-guest systems encompass a wide range of chemical species, including neutral organic molecules, cations, anions, peptides, dyes, and small biomolecules, characterized by diverse structural and physicochemical features such as amphiphilicity, hydrophobicity, aromaticity, and specific functional groups. Their ability to participate in non-covalent interactions and to be encapsulated or complexed by macrocyclic or container-type hosts underpins their role in supramolecular chemistry.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules include neutral organic molecules, cations (e.g., ammonium, alkyldiammonium cation, quaternary ammonium salt), anions, peptides (e.g., tripeptide, oligopeptide, amino acid(aa)), aromatic compounds (e.g., aromatic_guest_molecule, naphthalene, pyrene, bipyridinium_salt), dyes (e.g., fluorescent_dye, rhodamine, acridine_orange(AO)), and small biomolecules (e.g., acetylcholine, L-lysine, 5-fluorouracil(5-FU)).', 'Structural features of guest molecules relevant to host-guest complexation include amphiphilicity, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, presence of hydrophobic or hydrophilic side groups, aromatic moieties, alkyl chains, benzyl groups, imidazole functional groups, and positively-charged side groups (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'Guest molecules can exhibit conformational flexibility, high symmetry, and apolar nature, and may possess specific interaction sites such as n_diethylamino_group(N(Et)2) or lysine_residue.', 'Guest molecules are characterized by properties such as titration_profile, interaction_parameter(alpha), octanol_water_partition_coefficient(log_p), and can display photophysical properties including red-shifted or blue-shifted absorbance peaks, maximum absorbance peak wavelength (e.g., 390 nm), and bathochromic shift range (e.g., 400-470 nm) (DOI: 10.1039/D0QO00649A).', 'Guest molecules can be included in or excluded from hydrophobic cavities or macrocycles, and are often encapsulated by macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils (e.g., cucurbit(8)uril(CB(8))), cyclodextrins, and container compounds (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081;
