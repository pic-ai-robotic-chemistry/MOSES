{'summary': 'Supramolecular hosts containing pyrrole units are generally effective at binding anions due to the presence of NH groups that act as strong hydrogen bond donors, enabling robust and directional hydrogen bonding with anionic guests, often within preorganized macrocyclic or concave architectures that enhance selectivity and affinity.', 'key_points': ['Pyrrole units possess NH groups that serve as polar X–H hydrogen bond donors, which are highly effective for anion binding via hydrogen bonding (hydrogen bond donor type: polar_xh_donor).', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as calix(4)pyrrole are constructed from pyrrole units and feature a cone conformation that preorganizes multiple NH groups for convergent hydrogen bonding to anions, increasing binding strength and selectivity (calix(4)pyrrole: macrocycle, cone conformation, 4 pyrrole units, NH functional groups, can form hydrophobic pocket).', 'Hydrogen bonds formed between pyrrole NH groups and anions typically exhibit hydrogen bond distances in the range of 2.508–2.968 Å, supporting strong and specific host–guest interactions (10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Anion binding is further enabled by hydrophobic concavity in the host structure, which can partially desolvate the anion and enhance binding affinity (anion_binding is enabled by hydrophobic_concavity; anion: degree_of_desolvation = partial).', 'Anion recognition and binding are governed by non-covalent interactions, primarily hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction, with additional contributions from van der Waals forces and hydrophobic effects (anion_recognition uses hydrogen_bonding and electrostatic_interaction; non_covalent_interaction: van_der_waals_force, hydrophobic_interaction).', 'Anion binding is often studied and validated by molecular dynamics simulation, NMR spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), confirming the tight binding and stoichiometry (e.g., 1:1 model for anion–host complexes).', 'The effectiveness of pyrrole-based hosts is particularly notable for anions with weaker solvation (salting-in end of the Hofmeister series), as these anions are more easily desolvated and can interact more strongly with the host (anion: solvation_strength = weaker for salting-in anions).'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular chemistry leverages non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, to achieve molecular recognition and host–guest complex formation, with applications in biological and chemical systems (supramolecular_chemistry: has_subfield = host_guest_chemistry, molecular_recognition).', 'Hydrogen bonding is most relevant for selectivity in anion recognition and is stabilized in organic solvents, polar solvents, methanol, and water, but can be attenuated by water (hydrogen_bond: is_enabled_by organic_solvent, polar_solvent, methanol, water; is_attenuated_by water).', 'Macrocyclic pyrrole-based hosts, such as calix(4)pyrrole and porphyrin derivatives, can be further modified to enhance water solubility and binding properties (calix(4)pyrrole: can_be_modified_to water_soluble_synthetic_receptor).', 'Anion binding and recognition are influenced by the size and rigidity of the host cavity (molecular_recognition: is_influenced_by cavity_size, rigid_cone_conformation).', 'Anion binding is mediated not only by hydrogen bonding but also by sigma-hole interactions, chalcogen bonding, and halogen bonding, depending on the host design (anion_binding: is_mediated_by sigma_hole_interaction; anion_recognition: is_enabled_by chalcogen_bonding, halogen_bonding).', 'The host–guest chemistry of pyrrole-based macrocycles is a specialization of supramolecular chemistry and is governed by weak interactions, with the primary driving force for anion recognition being electrostatic attraction (molecular_recognition: has_primary_driving_force = electrostatic_attraction).'], 'relationships': ['Pyrrole NH groups in macrocyclic hosts (e.g., calix(4)pyrrole) act as convergent hydrogen bond donors, enabling strong, directional binding to anions via multiple hydrogen bonds.', 'Hydrophobic concavity in the host structure facilitates partial desolvation of the anion, which is necessary for effective binding, especially for anions with weaker hydration shells (salting-in anions).', 'The effectiveness of anion binding is modulated by the interplay of hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and the preorganization of the host cavity, which together determine selectivity and affinity.', "Anion binding is most efficient for anions that are less strongly hydrated, as these are more easily desolvated and can interact more favorably with the host's hydrogen bond donors.", 'Macrocyclic pyrrole-based hosts can be structurally tuned (e.g., by modifying meso substituents or cavity size) to optimize anion selectivity and binding strength for specific applications.']}
