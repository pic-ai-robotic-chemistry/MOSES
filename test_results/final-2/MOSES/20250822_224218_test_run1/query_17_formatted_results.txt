{'summary': 'Cage molecules and macrocycles both serve as supramolecular hosts with significant overlap in applications such as host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, encapsulation, and drug delivery, but they differ in structural features and specific guest selectivity, leading to distinct and complementary uses in supramolecular chemistry.', 'key_points': ['Macrocycles (including macrocyclic hosts, compounds, and receptors) are widely applied in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, drug delivery, chemosensing, catalysis, fluorescence switching, molecular delivery, nanotechnology, separation, supramolecular dye lasers, and molecular architecture (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081, 10.1002/ejoc.201601663).', 'Cage molecules (including molecular cages and capsules) are characterized by their ability to encapsulate specific guests such as indole rings, alanine methyl groups, and aromatic compounds, and are used for guest encapsulation, selective recognition, and protection of encapsulated species (DOI: 10.1021/acs.joc.1c00794).', 'Both macrocycles and cage molecules participate in supramolecular encapsulation, guest encapsulation, and host-guest complex formation, with macrocycles forming inclusion complexes and cages providing confined environments for guest molecules.', 'Macrocyclic hosts exhibit high selectivity and affinity for a wide range of guests, including amino acids, peptides, proteins, drugs, biomarkers, and aromatic guests, and can be functionalized with hydrophilic, cationic, or charged groups to enhance water solubility and guest binding (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.201601663, 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Macrocyclic receptors are crucial for biomedical applications, drug delivery, drug design, self-assembly processes, and biochemical sensing, with high selectivity and preorganization for target molecules (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479, 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Encapsulation by both macrocycles and cages can modulate fluorescence intensity, protect excited states, and influence aggregation/disaggregation processes (DOI: 10.1016/j.saa.2020.118177, 10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107919).', 'Macrocycles are integrated into nanostructures and sensing scaffolds, and serve as platforms for multivalent systems and artificial light-harvesting systems (ALHS).', 'Macrocyclic systems are developed to improve chemotherapy drug performance (DOI: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest chemistry involving macrocycles and cages is investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy, 1H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and UV-Vis spectroscopy (DOI: 10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107919).', 'Macrocycles possess hydrophobic or nano-cavities, high symmetry, electron-rich environments, and can be rigid or have controlled flexibility, enabling selective binding and molecular recognition in aqueous environments (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201605394, 10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).', 'Macrocyclic hosts include subtypes such as cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararene, cyclophane derivatives, and triazine-based hosts, each with unique guest selectivity and functionalization potential.', 'Cage-like compounds may feature p-electron-rich cavities and multiple sulfonate groups, enhancing their ability to encapsulate and protect guest molecules.', 'Encapsulation processes can result in complexes with linear or folded structures, and can be observed by NMR and measured by fluorescence quenching (DOI: 10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107919, 10.1007/s10847-018-0786-0).', 'Molecular recognition by macrocycles is driven by hydrophobic effects, ion-dipole interactions, electrostatic attraction, and weak noncovalent interactions, and is influenced by cavity size and conformation (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G, 10.1021/jo502825z).', 'Macrocycles and cages are central to supramolecular chemistry, which focuses on noncovalent interactions, self-assembly, and the development of molecular machines and assemblies with applications under biological conditions (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles and cage molecules both function as supramolecular hosts, but macrocycles typically offer more tunable selectivity and functionalization, while cages provide more complete encapsulation and protection of guests.', 'Both classes are integral to host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and encapsulation, with overlapping applications in drug delivery, sensing, and catalysis.', 'Macrocyclic hosts and receptors are often used in biomedical and analytical applications due to their high selectivity, affinity, and ability to be functionalized for water solubility and target specificity.', 'Encapsulation by macrocycles and cages can modulate photophysical properties (e.g., fluorescence), protect guest molecules from quenching and radiationless transitions, and influence aggregation states.', 'Macrocycles serve as building blocks for supramolecular aggregates, nanostructures, and multivalent systems, while cages are more specialized for guest encapsulation and selective recognition.', 'The selectivity and binding affinity of macrocycles are influenced by cavity size, rigidity, and functional group modification, while cages rely on the size and electronic properties of their internal cavities.']}
