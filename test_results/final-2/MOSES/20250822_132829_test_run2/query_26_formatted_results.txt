{'summary': 'The principal types of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions are calixarenes, cucurbiturils, cyclophanes, pillararenes, and crown ethers, each featuring electron-rich aromatic or macrocyclic cavities that facilitate selective cation-π binding.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes are macrocyclic supramolecular hosts with a bowl-shaped, hydrophobic cavity composed of phenolic units and methylene bridges, capable of binding cationic guests (e.g., methylated lysine, acetylcholine, amine drugs) via cation-π interactions. They possess electron donor groups such as alkoxy aryl and hydroxyl aryl groups, and can be derivatized for enhanced selectivity.', 'Cucurbiturils are synthetic container molecules with a rigid, electron-rich cavity and carbonyl-lined portals, exhibiting high-affinity binding for cationic guests (e.g., amino acids, peptides) through cation-π and ion-dipole interactions, particularly targeting aromatic side chains and methylated lysine.', 'Cyclophanes are synthetic container molecules, often cyclic phenylalkanes, that act as hosts for organic guest molecules, especially alkylammonium ions, via cation-π interactions. Their structure is comparable to biological recognition sites, and they are used as synthetic receptors in host-guest chemistry.', 'Pillararenes are macrocyclic hosts with electron-rich cavities and demonstrated cation-π interactions, particularly with amine groups. They show selectivity for specific amino acids (e.g., L-asparagine) and can be functionalized for water solubility and enhanced guest recognition.', 'Crown ethers are macrocyclic compounds with cation-complexing properties, binding ammonium cations and amine groups through cation-π and ion-dipole interactions. They are used in host-guest molecular recognition systems, often with trimethylammonium guests.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts are designed for selective recognition of biological targets, including amino acids, peptides, proteins, and posttranslationally methylated partners, often using weak interactions such as cation-π, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic effects.', 'Many supramolecular hosts (e.g., calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararenes) are macrocycles or synthetic container molecules, with structural features (e.g., hydrophobic cavities, electron-rich aromatic rings) that promote cation-π interactions.', 'Host-guest chemistry involving cation-π interactions is central to applications in biochemistry, chemical biology, drug detection, drug carrier systems, and sensor applications.', 'Calixarenes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils are frequently used for the recognition of methylated lysine and other methylated amino acids, exploiting cation-π interactions for selectivity and affinity.', 'Derivatization and functionalization (e.g., sulfonation, alkylation) of macrocyclic hosts can modulate their binding properties, solubility, and selectivity for specific cationic guests.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils share a macrocyclic architecture with electron-rich cavities, enabling selective cation-π binding of methylated lysine and other cationic biomolecules.', 'Cyclophanes and crown ethers, while structurally distinct, also utilize cation-π interactions for selective binding of ammonium and alkylammonium ions, paralleling biological recognition mechanisms.', 'Many supramolecular hosts are structurally related or have subfamilies (e.g., calix(n)arene as a subfamily of cyclophane; sulfonatocalixarenes as derivatives of calixarenes) that retain or enhance cation-π binding capabilities.', 'Functionalization (e.g., sulfonation, alkylation, amide formation) of macrocyclic hosts is a common strategy to tune cation-π interaction strength, selectivity, and solubility for specific applications in sensing, drug delivery, and molecular recognition.']}
