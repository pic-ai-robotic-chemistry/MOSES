{'summary': 'When a calixarene containing pyrrole groups binds an anion, the specific non-covalent interactions typically involved are hydrogen bonding, anion–π interactions, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, and sigma-hole interactions, with the binding process enabled by the hydrophobic concavity of the calixarene macrocycle.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonding is a primary non-covalent interaction, particularly between the NH groups of pyrrole moieties and the anion (hydrogen_bonding, hydrogen_bond).', 'Anion–π interactions may occur between the electron-rich π-system of the pyrrole rings and the anion (anion_pi_interaction, not explicitly listed in the ontology results but chemically relevant for pyrrole-containing hosts).', "Sigma-hole interactions can mediate anion binding, as indicated by the property 'is_mediated_by: sigma_hole_interaction' for anion_binding (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).", 'Hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals forces contribute to the stabilization of the anion within the hydrophobic cavity of the calixarene (hydrophobic_interaction, van_der_waals_force).', 'The hydrophobic concavity of the calixarene macrocycle is a key structural feature that enables anion binding (is_enabled_by: hydrophobic_concavity, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Non-covalent interactions in these systems can be modulated by cooperativity, affecting binding strength and selectivity (can_be_modulated_by: cooperativity, DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).'], 'background_information': ['Calixarenes are macrocyclic, synthetic receptors with a bowl-shaped, hydrophobic cavity, often derivatized to introduce specific binding functionalities such as pyrrole groups (is_type_of: macrocycle, receptor, supramolecular_host; has_shape: bowl_shape; has_cavity: hydrophobic_cavity).', 'Pyrrole groups are known for their ability to act as hydrogen bond donors via their NH protons, which is critical for anion recognition in supramolecular chemistry.', 'Anion binding by calixarene derivatives is a central topic in supramolecular chemistry and is often studied using molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate binding modes and energetics (is_studied_by: molecular_dynamics_simulation, DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'The host–guest complexation process in calixarene–anion systems is driven by a combination of non-covalent interactions, with the macrocycle acting as the host and the anion as the guest (occurs_between: host, guest; is_host: host_guest_complex).', 'Non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions are fundamental driving forces in supramolecular engineering and molecular recognition (is_driving_force_for: supramolecular_engineering, DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'The selectivity and affinity of calixarene-based anion receptors can be tuned by modifying the rim substituents, such as introducing pyrrole groups, which enhance hydrogen bonding and anion–π interactions.'], 'relationships': ['Hydrogen bonding and anion–π interactions are directly facilitated by the presence of pyrrole groups on the calixarene scaffold, providing directional and specific binding sites for anions.', 'The hydrophobic concavity of the calixarene macrocycle not only enables encapsulation of the anion but also enhances the effectiveness of non-covalent interactions by excluding water and other competing species from the binding site.', 'Sigma-hole interactions, as a type of non-covalent interaction, can further stabilize the anion within the host cavity, especially for halide anions (is_mediated_by: sigma_hole_interaction, DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Cooperativity among multiple non-covalent interactions can modulate the overall binding affinity and selectivity of the calixarene–anion complex (can_be_modulated_by: cooperativity, DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'The macrocyclic structure of calixarene allows for the formation of host–guest complexes with defined stoichiometry, such as 2:1 receptor:anion complexes (complex_stoichiometry: 2:1 receptor:I-, DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).']}
