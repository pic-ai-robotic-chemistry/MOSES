{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are capable of detecting a diverse range of molecular analytes, including trimethylated lysine, caffeine, metal ions, anions, peptides, proteins, nucleotides, and nucleic acids, by exploiting competitive binding interactions with recognition elements and indicator dyes.', 'key_points': ['IDAs detect trimethylated lysine as a specific analyte (DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F).', 'IDAs are applied for caffeine sensing, demonstrating selectivity for caffeine.', 'IDAs utilize recognition elements such as deep cavitand and carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6), and indicator dyes including safranine T (ST), lucigenin, and dye_28.', 'IDAs are suitable for use in lipid membrane constructs and living cells (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Analytes detectable by IDA include metal ions, anions, peptides, proteins, nucleotides, and nucleic acids, as supported by their roles as analytes in competitive binding and displacement processes.'], 'background_information': ['The indicator displacement assay (IDA) mechanism relies on competitive binding, where an analyte displaces a pre-bound indicator dye from a host or recognition element, resulting in a measurable signal change.', 'Recognition elements such as deep cavitand and carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6) provide selective binding sites for target analytes, while indicator dyes (e.g., safranine T, lucigenin, dye_28) serve as optical reporters.', 'Analytes in IDA can interact with recognition elements through various non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic effects.', 'Anions are characterized by their interactions with hosts, solvation, ion pairing, and are often ranked by the Hofmeister series; they can be measured by NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', 'Peptides and proteins detected by IDA may possess specific motifs, post-translational modifications (e.g., trimethyllysine), or accessible binding sites (e.g., c-terminal or n-terminal amino acid residues, peptide side-chains).', 'Nucleotides and nucleic acids can be recognized by specific receptors (e.g., receptor_7 for 1:1 and 1:2 binding) and may be modified or condensed by host molecules such as cucurbituril (CB).'], 'relationships': ['Trimethylated lysine is detected by IDA using deep cavitand as the recognition element and safranine T as the indicator dye (DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F).', 'Caffeine is selectively detected by IDA, with carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6) as the host and lucigenin or dye_28 as indicator dyes (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Metal ions and anions act as analytes in IDA, competing with indicator dyes for binding to host molecules, and their detection is influenced by solvation, ion pairing, and host-guest chemistry.', 'Peptides and proteins are detected based on their accessible binding sites and post-translational modifications, which can be recognized by host molecules in IDA.', 'Nucleotides and nucleic acids are detected by IDA through specific binding interactions with host molecules or receptors, and their structural modifications can influence assay performance.']}
