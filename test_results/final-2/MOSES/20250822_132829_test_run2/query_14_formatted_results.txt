{'summary': 'Specific types of macrocycles in chemistry include crown ethers, cyclodextrins, calixarenes, porphyrins, cyclophanes, and cryptands, each characterized by distinct structural motifs, binding properties, and host-guest chemistry applications.', 'key_points': ['Macrocycles are large ring-shaped molecules (typically containing twelve or more atoms) with a well-defined cavity, high preorganization, and controlled flexibility, enabling selective binding of guest molecules such as peptides, amino acids, and small organic compounds (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398, 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Crown ethers are synthetic macrocyclic compounds composed of repeating ether groups, notable for their cation-complexing property, especially for ammonium cations and alkali metal ions, and are central to early host-guest molecular recognition systems (DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides with hydrophobic cavities, frequently used as host molecules in supramolecular chemistry, driven by hydrophobic effects and capable of forming inclusion complexes with hydrophobic amino acids, peptides, and surfactants (DOI:10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004, 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).', 'Calixarenes are macrocyclic oligomers of phenol units linked by methylene bridges, possessing a hydrophobic cavity and bowl-shaped structure, widely used as synthetic receptors for host-guest chemistry, drug detection, and recognition of methylated lysines (DOI:10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4, 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Porphyrins are large heterocyclic macrocycles with intense extinction coefficients, functionalizable at meso and beta positions, and are key chromophores in exciton chirality methods and host-guest assemblies (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'Cyclophanes are macrocycles consisting of aromatic rings (e.g., xylene, ethenoanthracene) connected by aliphatic bridges, notable for their water solubility, synthetic receptor function, and ability to bind alkylammonium ions and organic guest molecules (DOI:10.1002/cbic.201800398, 10.1007/s10847-015-0546-3).', 'Cryptands are macrobicyclic ligands capable of encapsulating guest molecules, often functionalized with dyes (e.g., anthracene, naphthalimide) for selective anion recognition (DOI:10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).'], 'background_information': ['Macrocycles exhibit intrinsic fluorescence, strong shielding effects, and can be integrated into sensing scaffolds and nanostructures. Their binding affinities can reach nanomolar levels for specific targets such as lysophosphatidic acid, and their complex stability with peptides increases with the number of positively charged residues (DOI:10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Crown ethers were discovered as minor synthetic byproducts and are used as hosts in host-guest molecular recognition systems, with their binding driven by ion-dipole interactions and influenced by electronic and solvation effects (DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Cyclodextrins are highly used in pharmaceutical research and food science, act as constituents of nanoparticle-based drug carrier systems, and display high affinity for fluorescent indicators and analytes. Their anion affinity ranges from 1.6â€“5.7 kcal mol^-1 (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Calixarenes are easily synthesized via condensation reactions (e.g., formaldehyde with p-alkylphenols under basic conditions), are highly derivatizable, and can encapsulate organic compounds, act as drug carriers, and serve as platforms for sensor applications. They are related to cavitands and can form molecular assemblies and capsular-like adducts (DOI:10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4, 10.1021/jo502825z).', 'Porphyrins possess four frontier orbitals (HOMO, HOMO-1, LUMO, LUMO+1) and exhibit intense extinction coefficients, with their fluorescence and spectral properties modulated upon inclusion in host macrocycles such as cucurbiturils (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925, 10.1016/j.dyepig.2016.04.013).', 'Cyclophanes are studied for their amphiphilic characteristics, host-guest chemistry, and as synthetic container molecules mimicking biological recognition sites.

They are structurally distinct from other macrocycles due to their macrobicyclic framework.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles serve as supramolecular hosts and are structurally related to pillararenes, cucurbiturils, and cyclodextrins, sharing the ability to form inclusion complexes and host-guest assemblies (DOI:10.1002/chem.201605394).', 'Crown ethers, calixarenes, cyclodextrins, and cryptands are all synthetic macrocyclic hosts, often compared and contrasted for their binding selectivity, solubility, and ease of derivatization.', 'Calixarenes are structurally related to cyclophanes and cavitands, and their derivatives (e.g., p-sulfonatocalix(n)arene) improve water solubility and binding properties.', 'Cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and cucurbiturils are frequently used in supramolecular chemistry for molecular recognition, with each class offering unique advantages in terms of cavity size, hydrophobicity, and guest selectivity.', 'Porphyrins, when included in macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils, exhibit modulated photophysical properties, including changes in fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and spectral band shifts (DOI:10.1016/j.dyepig.2016.04.013).', 'Cyclophanes and calixarenes share structural motifs and are both used as synthetic receptors for organic and biological guest molecules.']}
