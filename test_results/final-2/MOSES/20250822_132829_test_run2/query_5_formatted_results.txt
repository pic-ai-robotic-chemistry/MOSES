{'summary': 'No direct evidence was found for the use of indicator displacement assay (IDA) in electrochemical sensors specifically for the detection of quinine. However, relevant technical details about IDA components, quinine detection methods, and their contextual relationships are available.', 'key_points': ['No records directly link indicator displacement assay (IDA) with electrochemical sensors for quinine detection in the queried sources.', 'Indicator displacement assay (IDA) utilizes components such as synthetic_receptor, beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), graphene, and poly(N-acetylaniline), and is typically associated with optical_sensor outputs rather than electrochemical sensors.', 'Quinine is detected and analyzed by several electrochemical techniques, including differential_pulse_voltammetry (DPV), electrochemiluminescence_biosensor, ion_transfer_voltammetry (ITV), and quantitative_electrochemical_method, but not explicitly by IDA-based electrochemical sensors.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator displacement assay (IDA) is characterized by the use of a synthetic_receptor and an indicator, and can be coupled with differential_sensing. It is performed in live_cell environments and targets a range of analytes, including drugs and biological molecules.', 'IDA systems incorporate components such as beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), graphene, and poly(N-acetylaniline), which are relevant in sensor design and supramolecular chemistry.', 'Quinine, an alkaloid derived from cinchona_tree_bark, is commonly dissolved in ethanol or diluted in phosphate_buffer_solution (PBS) for analysis. It is analyzed by colorimetric_assay, fluorescence_assay, high_performance_liquid_chromatography (HPLC), and high_resolution_mass_spectrometry (HRMS), in addition to electrochemical techniques.', 'Quinine is determined by differential_pulse_voltammetry (DPV) and detected by electrochemiluminescence_biosensor, ion_transfer_voltammetry (ITV), and quantitative_electrochemical_method, indicating a broad applicability of electrochemical detection methods for this analyte.'], 'relationships': ['IDA is associated with synthetic_receptor and indicator components, and is performed in live_cell environments, but its sensor output is typically optical rather than electrochemical.', 'Quinine is a target for multiple electrochemical detection methods, but there is no explicit connection to IDA-based electrochemical sensors in the available data.', 'IDA and quinine detection both involve advanced supramolecular and sensor chemistry, but their intersection in the context of electrochemical sensors is not documented in the queried sources.']}
