{'summary': 'Host-guest interactions are governed by a complex interplay of non-covalent forces, structural complementarity, thermodynamic parameters, and environmental factors, which collectively determine the affinity, selectivity, and stability of host-guest complexes.', 'key_points': ['Non-covalent interactions are the primary forces controlling host-guest interaction, including hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic effects, π-π stacking interactions, ion-dipole interactions, and dipole-dipole interactions (10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709; 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Hydrogen bonds are among the most relevant interactions for selectivity and stabilization of host-guest complexes, with measured hydrogen bond distances in host-guest systems ranging from 2.508 Å to 2.968 Å (10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Van der Waals interactions are critical for selectivity and stabilization, especially in hosts with polarizable, saturated nonpolar pockets, and contribute to favorable enthalpy in complexation (10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Electrostatic interactions, including cation-π and charge-assisted hydrogen bonds, are primary drivers for guest location and binding affinity, but are extremely sensitive to the environment and can be overwhelmed by other effects (10.1002/chem.201605394;
