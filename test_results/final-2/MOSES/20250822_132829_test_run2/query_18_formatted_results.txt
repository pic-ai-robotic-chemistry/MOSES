{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind anions via anion-π interactions are electron-deficient macrocyclic hosts, particularly macrocyclic arenes such as 2,6-helic[6]arene and its derivatives. These hosts utilize their π-acidic cavities to engage in selective anion recognition through anion-π interactions.', 'key_points': ['Macrocyclic arenes, especially 2,6-helic[6]arene, 2,6-helic[6]arene derivatives, and related π-acidic macrocycles, are established supramolecular hosts for anion binding via anion-π interactions.', 'Specific examples include: 2,6-helic(6)arene, 2,6-helic(6)arene_derivative, 2,6-helix(6)arene, 2,6_helic(6)arene_rac_1, and hexamethyl-substituted_2,6_helic(6)arene_rac_2.', 'These macrocyclic hosts are characterized by electron-deficient π-surfaces, which are essential for stabilizing anion-π interactions.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes, cucurbiturils, cyclophane derivatives, and pillararene derivatives are structurally related, but only those with electron-deficient (π-acidic) cavities are capable of significant anion-π binding.', 'Acyclic receptors such as molecular tweezers and tripodal receptors can also be engineered for anion-π recognition, but macrocyclic π-acidic hosts are the prototypical systems.'], 'background_information': ['Anion-π interactions are noncovalent interactions between an anion and the π-system of an electron-deficient aromatic ring, requiring a π-acidic (electron-poor) surface for effective binding.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are defined by their rigid, fixed, and often highly symmetric structures, which provide a preorganized cavity for guest binding (10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).', 'Macrocyclic hosts can be easily functionalized to tune their electronic properties, including the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups to enhance π-acidity (10.1002/chem.201605394).', 'The hydrophobic and electron-deficient nature of the cavity is critical for anion-π recognition, distinguishing these hosts from electron-rich macrocycles (which favor cation-π interactions).', 'Anion receptors operating via anion-π interactions are extremely rare in aqueous solution and are typically studied in organic solvents due to the competitive solvation of anions in water (10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Macrocyclic hosts have applications in molecular recognition, chemosensing, catalysis, and supramolecular assembly, with anion-π binding being a specialized function within this broader context (10.1002/ejoc.201601663).'], 'relationships': ['Macrocyclic hosts with electron-deficient π-surfaces (e.g., 2,6-helic[6]arene) are a subset of supramolecular hosts and anion receptors that specifically enable anion-π interactions.', 'The ability of a macrocyclic host to bind anions via anion-π interactions is directly related to its π-acidity, which can be modulated by chemical functionalization.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are structurally related to other supramolecular hosts (e.g., molecular cages, acyclic receptors), but only those with π-acidic cavities are effective for anion-π binding.', "Anion-π binding is a distinct recognition mode compared to hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, or cation-π interactions, and requires careful design of the host's electronic environment.", 'The rarity of anion-π binding in aqueous solution highlights the importance of solvent effects and the need for highly π-acidic hosts to overcome competitive solvation.']}
