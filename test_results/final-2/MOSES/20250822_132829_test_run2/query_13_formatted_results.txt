{'summary': 'Guest molecules for supramolecular hosts encompass a wide range of chemical species, including small organic molecules, ions, peptides, dyes, and water molecules, characterized by specific structural motifs, functional groups, and physicochemical properties that enable non-covalent interactions and encapsulation within host cavities.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules include a diverse set of chemical entities: alkanes (e.g., n-alkane, decane), aromatic compounds (e.g., naphthalene, pyrene, bipyridinium salts), amino acids and peptides (e.g., L-lysine, tripeptide), dyes and fluorophores (e.g., acridine orange, rhodamine, perylene bisimide dye), cationic and anionic species (e.g., quaternary ammonium salts, alkyldiammonium cations), and water molecules (e.g., high-energy water molecule, TIP3P water molecule).', 'Guest molecules often possess specific functional groups or moieties such as aromatic moieties, imidazole functional groups, benzyl groups, alkyl chains, hydrophilic side groups, hydrophobic side groups, and positively-charged side groups.', 'Key physicochemical properties include amphiphilicity, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, octanol-water partition coefficient (log P), and the presence of interaction sites (e.g., n-diethylamino group (N(Et)2)).', 'Guest molecules participate in non-covalent interactions with hosts, including hydrogen bonding, π-π interactions, cation binding, anion binding, and hydrophobic effects, and can be characterized by titration profiles and interaction parameters (e.g., interaction parameter (alpha)).', 'Encapsulation and binding are typically observed with macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils such as CB(8), cyclodextrins, container compounds), with guests being included in hydrophobic cavities or macrocycles.', 'Guest molecules can induce or exhibit changes in photophysical properties (e.g., UV-Vis absorption spectrum, fluorescence response, absorbance peak shifts), and may serve as components in functional assemblies such as drug delivery systems, fluorescent sensors, logic gates, and photofunctional materials.', 'Quantitative and structural parameters include maximum absorbance peak wavelength (e.g., 390 nm), bathochromic shift range (400–470 nm), number of guest molecules per complex (e.g., 3), and hydration level (e.g., readily hydrated guests 2–4).'], 'background_information': ['Guest molecules are defined as molecular targets that form host-guest complexes via molecular recognition and non-covalent interactions, central to supramolecular chemistry.', 'The inclusion or exclusion of guest molecules in host cavities is influenced by their size, shape, charge, hydrophobicity, and the presence of specific binding motifs or side groups.', 'Guest molecules may exist in complexed or free states, and their binding can exhibit cooperativity (positive, negative, or non-cooperativity), as characterized by interaction parameters and titration profiles (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'The encapsulation of guest molecules by macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins) is often optimized and studied using density functional theory (DFT) and is associated with changes in entropy, potential energy, and microenvironment (DOI: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4;
