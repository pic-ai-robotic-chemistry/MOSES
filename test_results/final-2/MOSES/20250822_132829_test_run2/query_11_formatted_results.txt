{'summary': 'A cryptand is a macrobicyclic ligand that encapsulates guest molecules, functioning as a host in host-guest chemistry and often used in supramolecular chemistry for selective molecular recognition.', 'key_points': ['Cryptands are a class of macrobicyclic ligands specifically designed to encapsulate guest molecules, particularly in host-guest chemistry contexts.', 'They are macrocyclic compounds that can be functionalized with anthracene dye or naphthalimide dye, which imparts selectivity for specific anions such as sulfate.', "Cryptands are capable of binding organic guests, as indicated by the property restriction 'has_guest: SOME organic_guest' (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).", 'The functionalization with anthracene or naphthalimide dyes is described as a union, meaning cryptands may be modified with either or both dye types to tune their recognition properties.'], 'background_information': ['Cryptands are classified as a subclass of macrobicyclic ligands and also as receptors, particularly when functionalized for anion recognition (e.g., sulfate).', 'They are integral to supramolecular chemistry, a field focused on non-covalent interactions and molecular recognition.', 'The encapsulation ability of cryptands is central to their role in molecular recognition and host-guest chemistry, where they act as hosts for various organic guests.', 'The parent classes of cryptand include macrobicyclic_ligand, receptor, and supramolecular_chemistry, situating them within the broader context of molecular recognition and chemical research.'], 'relationships': ['Cryptands are functionally related to macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers, but are distinguished by their macrobicyclic (three-dimensional) structure, which enhances their encapsulation capabilities.', 'Functionalization with anthracene or naphthalimide dyes is directly linked to the selectivity and recognition properties of cryptands, especially for anions like sulfate.', "The property 'has_guest: SOME organic_guest' establishes cryptands as host molecules in host-guest chemistry, with specificity for organic guest species (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).", "Cryptands' classification as both macrobicyclic ligands and receptors highlights their dual role in structure and function within supramolecular and host-guest chemistry."]}
