{'summary': 'IDA-based electrochemical sensors utilize a range of non-covalent host-guest interactions—including hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, π-π stacking, and metal coordination—to achieve selective molecular recognition and signal transduction.', 'key_points': ['Host-guest interactions in IDA-based electrochemical sensors are non-covalent and include hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions (including ion-dipole and dipole-dipole interactions), π-π stacking interactions, and metal coordination.', 'Hydrogen bonding: Involves interactions such as between carbonyl oxygen atoms and pyridine NH binding sites, and is mediated by functional groups like hydroxyl, carbonyl, and amine linkers. Hydrogen bonds stabilize host-guest complexes and are validated by techniques such as atoms-in-molecules analysis and reduced density gradients analysis. Hydrogen bonding is attenuated by water and limited in high-energy water environments.', 'Hydrophobic interactions: These occur between hydrophobic guests (e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons, n-alkanes) and hydrophobic cavities of macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, calixarenes). Hydrophobic effects are influenced by molecular shape, apolar chains, and are modeled by synthetic receptors and membranes. Hydrophobic binding is often accompanied by the release of high-energy water molecules from the host cavity.', 'Electrostatic interactions: Include ion-dipole and dipole-dipole interactions, as well as electrostatic attraction and complexation between charged groups (e.g., lysine residues and sulfonate groups). Electrostatic interactions are evaluated by DFT calculations and are affected by counterions, solvation, and the presence of salts or co-solutes.', 'π-π stacking interactions: Involve aromatic moieties and are influenced by classical and non-classical hydrophobic effects. π-π stacking can modulate fluorescence emission and is evidenced by changes in spectroscopic properties.', 'Metal coordination: Involves the formation of coordination complexes between metal ions and ligands within the host or guest, and is applied to systems such as cavitands.', 'Host-guest interactions are characterized by size/shape complementarity, cavity interactions, and can be light-responsive (e.g., azobenzene-cyclodextrin systems).', 'Host-guest interactions are dynamic, can involve rapid exchange of proton signals, and are studied using quantum chemical calculations, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), NMR spectroscopy (1H NMR, 2D NOESY), fluorescence spectroscopy, UV absorption spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations.', 'Quantitative parameters such as association constant (Ka, ka), binding affinity, binding free energy, enthalpy change, and entropy change are used to characterize host-guest interactions in these systems.', 'Host-guest interactions result in the formation of inclusion complexes, host-guest complexes, and can lead to dye displacement, fluorescence modulation, stimulus-responsive release, and pKa shifts in indicator displacement assays.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest chemistry is a specialization of supramolecular chemistry and is fundamentally based on molecular recognition, which is critical for the selectivity of IDA-based electrochemical sensors.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils (CB(7), Q(8)), cyclodextrins (β-CD), calixarenes, and deep cavitands are commonly used as recognition elements in IDA-based sensors, forming inclusion complexes with a variety of guest molecules (e.g., amino acids, peptides, methylated lysine, quinine, caffeine).', 'The performance of IDA-based electrochemical sensors is influenced by the structure of the solute, solvent, presence of salts or co-solutes, and the physicochemical properties of the host and guest.', 'Host-guest interactions in aqueous solution are often studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), NMR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and UV-Vis spectroscopy, providing detailed thermodynamic and structural information.', 'Electrochemical sensors constructed using IDA principles are verified by techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), FTIR, and SEM, and are characterized by properties such as selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and reusability.', 'Host-guest interactions can be modulated by external stimuli (e.g., light-responsive systems), and can be engineered for biomedical applications, drug delivery, and applied bioscience.', 'The dynamic and reversible nature of non-covalent host-guest interactions enables the indicator displacement assay (IDA) principle, where a competitive guest displaces an indicator dye from the host, resulting in a measurable electrochemical or optical signal.'], 'relationships': ['Hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, π-π stacking, and metal coordination are all subclasses of non-covalent interactions and supramolecular interactions, forming the mechanistic basis for host-guest recognition in IDA-based sensors (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709, 10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479).', 'Host-guest interactions are characterized by size/shape complementarity, cavity interactions, and can be influenced by desolvation of the host cavity or guest (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'Macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins) provide hydrophobic cavities and functional groups for multiple interaction types, enabling selective binding of diverse guests (DOI: 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028, 10.1002/chem.201800587).', 'The IDA principle leverages the competitive binding of analytes and indicator dyes to the host, with the displacement event transduced into an electrochemical signal (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Thermodynamic parameters (association constant, binding free energy, enthalpy, entropy) and spectroscopic/analytical techniques (ITC, NMR, fluorescence, UV-Vis) are used to quantify and characterize host-guest interactions in sensor design (DOI: 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028, 10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479).']}
