## 1. Are there electrochemical sensors using Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) to detect Quinine?

Electrochemical sensors utilizing the Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) methodology are indeed applicable for the detection of quinine, although explicit examples of such devices in the literature are limited. The IDA approach, a hallmark of supramolecular analytical chemistry, leverages non-covalent host–guest interactions to transduce molecular recognition events into measurable signals. In the context of quinine detection, this typically involves the use of a synthetic receptor—such as β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)—which forms a 1:1 inclusion complex with quinine via hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions within its toroidal cavity.

In a prototypical IDA, a competitive binding scenario is established: a reporter (indicator) is initially bound to the host, producing a baseline signal. Upon introduction of quinine, the analyte competes for the host binding site, displacing the indicator. This displacement event can be transduced electrochemically if the indicator or the host–guest complex is electroactive, or if the displacement modulates the electrochemical properties of the system (e.g., via changes in charge transfer resistance or redox peak shifts).

Electrochemical IDA platforms for quinine detection are feasible and have been constructed using components such as β-cyclodextrin, poly(N-acetylaniline), and graphene. These materials facilitate both the supramolecular recognition of quinine and the efficient transduction of the displacement event into an electrochemical signal. The host–guest complexation between β-CD and quinine is well-characterized, with binding constants typically in the range of 10^2–10^4 M^–1, depending on the medium and conditions. This interaction is strong enough to enable selective recognition, yet reversible to allow for indicator displacement.

Electrochemical detection of quinine is commonly achieved using techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). These methods are sensitive to changes in the local environment at the electrode surface, which can be modulated by the IDA process. For example, the formation of the quinine–β-CD complex can induce a shift in the redox peak potential or alter the charge transfer resistance, providing a quantitative readout of quinine concentration.

While most IDA-based sensors have traditionally employed optical outputs, the methodology is readily adaptable to electrochemical platforms. The key requirements are that the indicator or the host–guest complex exhibits electrochemical activity, or that the displacement event alters the interfacial properties of the electrode in a detectable manner. The use of nanostructured materials such as graphene can further enhance sensitivity by increasing surface area and facilitating electron transfer.

In summary, the integration of IDA with electrochemical sensing offers a robust and selective approach for quinine detection, capitalizing on the specificity of supramolecular host–guest chemistry and the sensitivity of modern electroanalytical techniques. Although direct literature examples of electrochemical IDA sensors for quinine are scarce, the underlying principles and available data strongly support their feasibility and practical implementation. This strategy exemplifies the power of supramolecular chemistry in the design of advanced analytical devices for alkaloid detection.
