{'summary': 'Electrochemical sensors constructed using the Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) methodology are applicable for the detection of quinine, with evidence of IDA-based sensor platforms and electrochemical techniques being used for quinine analysis. However, no direct literature or device example explicitly combining IDA and electrochemical detection of quinine is present in the provided data.', 'key_points': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a recognized assay type that can be constructed with components such as beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD), poly(N-acetylaniline), and graphene, and is capable of sensor conversion (sensor_conversion_capability: yes).', 'IDA is characterized by non-covalent interaction types and can be performed inside live cells (biological_location: inside live cells).', 'IDA can target a range of analytes, including drugs such as quinine (has_sensing_target: drug).', 'Electrochemical sensors are constructed using IDA (is_constructed_by: indicator_displacement_assay(IDA)) and have quinine as a detection target (has_detection_target: quinine).', 'Quinine is detected by quantitative electrochemical methods, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), electrochemiluminescence biosensors, and is determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).', 'Quinine forms a 1:1 molar ratio complex with β-CD, a common IDA component, and exhibits a slight proton peak shift, indicating host-guest interaction relevant to IDA-based sensing.', 'Electrochemical sensors for quinine are verified by cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS), and other analytical techniques.'], 'background_information': ['IDA-based sensors utilize synthetic receptors and indicators, and can be coupled with differential sensing strategies (is_coupled_with: differential_sensing, DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'IDA sensor outputs are typically optical, but the methodology is adaptable to electrochemical sensor platforms (sensor_conversion_capability: yes).', 'Quinine is an alkaloid derived from cinchona tree bark, used as a drug for malaria, lupus, arthritis, and muscle cramps, and as a bittering agent.', 'Quinine is hydrophobic, has low solubility in water, and is typically dissolved in ethanol or diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for analytical purposes.', 'Quinine recovery in analytical methods ranges from 98.3% to 109.3%, with a typical incubation time of 40 min and stock solution concentration of 10 mM.'], 'relationships': ['IDA and electrochemical sensors are directly connected: electrochemical sensors are constructed by IDA and can target quinine for detection.', 'β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), a component of IDA, forms a 1:1 host-guest complex with quinine, supporting the feasibility of IDA-based quinine sensing.', 'Quinine is analyzed by multiple electrochemical techniques, and the presence of IDA as a construction method for electrochemical sensors targeting quinine establishes a mechanistic link, though no explicit device example is cited in the data.']}
