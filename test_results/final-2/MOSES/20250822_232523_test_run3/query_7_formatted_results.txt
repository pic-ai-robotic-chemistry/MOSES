{'summary': 'Electrochemical sensors utilizing an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) for quinine detection demonstrate high stability and good reproducibility, with robust analytical performance metrics and minimal signal degradation over time.', 'key_points': ['Sensor stability: The electrochemical sensor retains 86.47% of its original differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signal value after 21 days, with negligible change in DPV signal during the first 7 days at 4°C, indicating high stability and acceptable peak current decrease within 21 days.', 'Sensor reproducibility: The sensor exhibits good reproducibility, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.06% across seven identical electrodes. Five independent electrodes displayed similar signals when detecting 30 μM quinine.', 'Analytical performance: The sensor demonstrates superior selectivity over common interfering molecules, is reusable, cost-effective, and provides reasonable accuracy and precision (DOI: 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Verification methods: Sensor performance and construction are verified by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).', 'Construction: The sensor is based on nanocomposite materials and is constructed using an indicator displacement assay (IDA) platform.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA): IDA is a non-covalent supramolecular sensing strategy that employs components such as beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD), poly(N-acetylaniline), and graphene, with synthetic receptors and indicators for analyte (including drug) detection. IDA is compatible with differential sensing and can be performed in live cells.', 'Host-guest chemistry: The IDA platform often leverages host-guest interactions, such as the 1:1 molar ratio complexation of quinine with β-cyclodextrin, which is investigated by techniques including H NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', 'Quinine detection: Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid with low solubility in water, typically prepared as a 10 mM stock solution in ethanol and diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for analysis. It is determined by DPV and other electrochemical techniques, with recovery rates between 98.3% and 109.3%.', "Analytical performance parameters: The sensor's analytical performance encompasses reproducibility, reusability, selectivity, linear response range, detection limit, and stability, and is demonstrated in real sample testing."], 'relationships': ["The electrochemical sensor's stability and reproducibility are directly linked to its nanocomposite-based construction and the use of IDA, which provides a robust supramolecular recognition interface for quinine.", "IDA's non-covalent host-guest chemistry, particularly involving β-cyclodextrin, underpins both the selectivity and the stability of the sensor platform.", "Verification of sensor performance through multiple analytical techniques (DPV, CV, EIS, FTIR, H NMR, SEM) ensures comprehensive characterization of both the sensor's physical structure and its analytical capabilities.", 'The compatibility of IDA with differential sensing and its ability to be performed in live cells highlight the versatility and adaptability of this approach for various analytical and bioanalytical applications.']}
