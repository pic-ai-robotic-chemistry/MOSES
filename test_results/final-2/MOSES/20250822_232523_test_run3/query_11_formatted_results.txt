{'summary': 'A cryptand is a macrobicyclic ligand, specifically a macrocyclic compound, known for its ability to encapsulate guest molecules and is often functionalized with dyes such as anthracene and naphthalimide to achieve selectivity for specific anions like sulfate.', 'key_points': ['Cryptands are a class of macrobicyclic ligands characterized by their ability to encapsulate guest molecules, particularly in host-guest chemistry.', 'Cryptands are macrocyclic compounds that can be functionalized with anthracene dye or naphthalimide dye, which imparts selectivity for specific anions such as sulfate.', "The property 'has_guest' for cryptands is restricted to 'organic_guest', indicating that cryptands are designed to encapsulate organic guest molecules (single(organic_guest), 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429).", "Cryptands are classified as both 'macrobicyclic_ligand' and 'receptor', reflecting their dual role in molecular recognition and selective binding."], 'background_information': ['Cryptands are central to supramolecular chemistry and molecular recognition, where their encapsulation properties are exploited for selective binding and sensing applications.', 'Functionalization with specific dyes (anthracene, naphthalimide) is used to tune the selectivity and sensing capabilities of cryptands, particularly for anions such as sulfate.', 'The concept of host-guest chemistry is fundamental to the function of cryptands, as they act as hosts that form complexes (cryptates) with guest species.', 'Cryptands are related to other macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers, but are distinguished by their three-dimensional, bicyclic structure which enhances their encapsulation ability.'], 'relationships': ["Cryptands are subclasses of both 'macrobicyclic_ligand' (10.1021/acsomega.7b00429) and 'receptor', indicating their structural and functional roles.", "The 'has_guest' relationship specifies that cryptands encapsulate 'organic_guest' molecules, establishing their role in selective molecular recognition.", "The 'is_functionalized_with' relationship details that cryptands can be modified with anthracene dye or naphthalimide dye, which is directly linked to their selectivity for specific anions.", 'Cryptands are integral to the domains of supramolecular_chemistry and molecular_recognition, as indicated by their ancestor classes.']}
