{'summary': 'Multiple types of host-guest interactions, including electrostatic interactions, are suitable for designing indicator displacement assays (IDAs) with optical detection, as they enable selective and reversible binding events that can be monitored by spectroscopic methods.', 'key_points': ['Electrostatic interactions are a key type of non-covalent force used in host-guest systems for IDA design, occurring between charged species such as cationic trimethylammonium groups and anionic pyren-1-olate, or between lysine residues and sulfonate groups (10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'Electrostatic interactions are highly sensitive to the environment and can be a primary driving force for guest location within the host cavity (10.1002/chem.201605394).', 'Host-guest interactions can be analyzed and detected using optical methods such as fluorescence data, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and 1H NMR spectroscopy (10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081; 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Host-guest interactions are exemplified by systems such as Q(8)-AC, 7-DCCAE with cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8), and quinine displacing methylene blue from β-cyclodextrin, all of which are relevant to IDA design.', 'Host-guest complex formation is effective in D2O and can involve biomacromolecules or cavity-bearing synthetic macrocycles as hosts, with guests such as 7-DCCAE (10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest interaction refers to the molecular recognition and binding between a host molecule (e.g., cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, calixarenes) and a guest molecule, forming a host-guest complex that is central to IDA operation.', 'Electrostatic interactions are a subclass of supramolecular and intermolecular forces, and can be further divided into electrostatic attraction, electrostatic repulsion, hydrogen bonds, and intramolecular hydrogen bonds (10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004; 10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'The selectivity and sensitivity of IDAs can be modulated by the nature of the host-guest interaction, with electrostatic interactions being less relevant for zwitterionic and neutral side chains but dominant for charged species.', 'Host-guest interactions are effective strategies for constructing biomaterials, deciphering molecular binding modes, and developing new disease treatments, highlighting their versatility beyond IDA design.', 'The binding energetics of electrostatic interactions can be influenced by entropic cancellation effects involving solute-solvent and solvent reorganization entropies (10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).'], 'relationships': ['Electrostatic interactions occur between specific functional groups, such as lysine residues and sulfonate groups, and can be evaluated by DFT calculations (10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'Host-guest interactions form host-guest complexes, which can be studied by fluorescence, UV-Vis, and NMR spectroscopy, providing optical readouts for IDA (10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081; 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Electrostatic interactions can act in concert with hydrophobic, π-π stacking, and hydrogen bonding interactions to drive guest inclusion and recognition, enhancing the robustness and selectivity of IDAs.', 'The host-guest interaction is effective in both biological and synthetic systems, with hosts such as CB7 and CB8 and guests like 7-DCCAE, and can be performed in aqueous environments such as D2O (10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).']}
