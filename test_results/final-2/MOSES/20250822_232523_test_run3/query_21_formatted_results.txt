{'summary': 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are capable of detecting a wide range of molecular analytes, including anions, metal ions, organic molecules, peptides, nucleotides, and nucleic acids, with high specificity and versatility depending on the host, indicator, and recognition element employed.', 'key_points': ['IDAs detect analytes by competitive binding, where the analyte displaces an indicator dye from a host–indicator complex, resulting in a measurable signal change.', 'Classes of molecules detectable by IDA include: anions (e.g., acetate, chloride, bromide, sulfate, phosphate, perchlorate, perrhenate, thiocyanate, oxalate, halides, hexafluorophosphate, Hofmeister series anions), metal ions (e.g., Cu(II), Fe(III)), organic molecules (e.g., amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, nucleotides, nucleic acids, drugs, metabolites), peptides (e.g., H3 histone tail, acetylated histone H4Kac, antimicrobial peptides, amyloidogenic proteins), nucleotides (e.g., ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP), and nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, RNA, single-stranded DNA).', 'Specific analytes detected by IDA include trimethylated lysine (DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F), caffeine, and a broad spectrum of post-translationally modified amino acids and peptides.', 'Recognition elements used in IDA include deep cavitands, calixarenes, macrocycles, and pillararenes, which provide selectivity for specific analyte classes.', 'Indicator dyes used in IDA include lucigenin and dye_28 (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost), with the choice of dye influencing sensitivity and selectivity.', 'IDAs can be performed in diverse environments, including aqueous solution, lipid membrane constructs, and living cells (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Association constants for analyte–host complexes can be quantified (e.g., 2.0 × 10^2), and complex conformations (parallel, perpendicular) are relevant for analyte recognition.', 'Experimental conditions such as solvent composition (95% water/5% deuterium oxide, pH 1) and analyte stability (preserved) are critical for assay performance.'], 'background_information': ['The indicator displacement assay is based on supramolecular host–guest chemistry, where a macrocyclic host (e.g., calixarene, pillarene, cucurbituril, cyclodextrin, deep cavitand) forms a complex with an indicator dye; the presence of an analyte with higher affinity displaces the dye, producing a detectable optical or fluorescent signal.', 'Analyte-responsive host–dye systems are typically based on macrocycles and are the result of aqueous host–guest chemistry (DOI: 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Analytes can interact with recognition elements via specific binding sites (e.g., copper center, calixarene), and may form parallel or perpendicular complexes with the host.', 'Analytes are present in various biological and chemical environments, including aqueous solution, HeLa cells, and lipid environments, enabling IDA application in both in vitro and in vivo settings.', 'The selectivity of IDA can be tuned by the choice of host, indicator, and recognition element, allowing for discrimination among structurally similar analytes (e.g., methylated vs. unmethylated lysine).', 'IDAs are applied for sensing biologically relevant molecules such as caffeine, post-translationally modified peptides, and nucleic acids, and can be used for biomarker detection, drug screening, and environmental monitoring.'], 'relationships': ['The host–indicator complex is central to IDA function: the host (e.g., carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene(WP6), deep cavitand) binds the indicator dye (e.g., lucigenin), and the analyte competes for the same binding site, leading to indicator displacement.', 'Recognition elements such as deep cavitands and calixarenes provide molecular selectivity, enabling IDA to distinguish between closely related analytes (e.g., different methylation states of lysine).', 'The choice of indicator dye (e.g., lucigenin, dye_28) and host structure (e.g., macrocycle, pillarene) determines the sensitivity, selectivity, and signal output of the assay.', 'Analyte–host interactions can be modulated by environmental factors (e.g., pH, solvent composition), and the stability of the analyte–host complex (e.g., preserved stability, association constant 2.0 × 10^2) is critical for reliable detection.', 'IDAs are compatible with complex biological matrices (e.g., living cells, lipid membranes), expanding their utility for real-time and in situ molecular sensing.']}
