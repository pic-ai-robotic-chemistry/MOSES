{'summary': 'Electrochemical sensors utilizing the Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) for quinine detection are supported by ontology data, with evidence of IDA-based sensor construction and quinine as a detection target. Calixarene and its derivatives are implicated as supramolecular hosts and recognition elements in such sensor platforms.', 'key_points': ['Electrochemical sensors are constructed using the Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) and have quinine as a detection target ("is_constructed_by: indicator_displacement_assay(IDA)", "has_detection_target: quinine").', 'These sensors are verified by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.', 'Electrochemical sensors based on IDA exhibit high selectivity ("superior selectivity over common interfering molecules"), good reproducibility ("Relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven identical electrodes"), high stability ("86.47% of original DPV signal value retained up to 21 days"), and repeatability ("Five independent electrodes displayed similar signals when detecting 30 Î¼M quinine").', 'Sensors are based on nanocomposite materials and are realized as sensing platforms.', 'Calixarene and calixarene derivatives are identified as macrocyclic supramolecular hosts, synthetic receptors, and are used in sensor applications, including drug detection and amine drug detection.', 'Calixarene derivatives possess water solubility ("solubilized in water through hydrophilic group introduction"), and can be functionalized at the upper or lower rim with groups such as carbamoyl (CONH2), cyano (CN), methoxy (MeO), and phenyl rings.', 'Quinine is analyzed by electrochemical techniques, including DPV, and is detected by quantitative electrochemical methods, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), and electrochemiluminescence biosensors.', 'Quinine is typically diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) or dissolved in ethanol for analysis, with a stock solution concentration of 10 mM and an incubation time of 40 min.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) involves a competitive binding mechanism where an indicator dye is displaced from a host molecule (e.g., calixarene) by the target analyte (e.g., quinine), resulting in a measurable signal change.', 'IDA systems utilize components such as carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6), safranine T (ST), and indicator dyes like lucigenin and dye 28. Assays can be performed in lipid membrane constructs and living cells.', 'Calixarene macrocycles are characterized by a hydrophobic cavity, high affinity for fluorescent indicators and analytes, and are fully addressable and easily derivatized. They are more soluble in organic solvents but can be made water-soluble via functionalization.', 'Calixarene-based sensors are particularly useful for specific and selective recognition of drugs, biomolecules, and organic compounds, and are applied in drug detection, drug contamination removal, and biomedical applications.', 'Calixarene derivatives are derived from calixarene (CA) and can bind guests such as trimethyllysine (Kme3). Functionalization with hydrophilic groups at the upper or lower rim enhances water solubility, which is critical for sensor applications in aqueous environments.', 'Electrochemical sensors are cost-effective, simple, and exhibit reasonable accuracy and precision (DOI: 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028). Nanocomposite-based sensors are referenced (DOI: 10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).'], 'relationships': ['Electrochemical sensors constructed by IDA are directly linked to quinine detection, with calixarene and its derivatives serving as the supramolecular host or recognition element in the IDA mechanism.', 'Calixarene macrocycles provide the host-guest chemistry necessary for IDA, enabling selective recognition and displacement of indicator dyes by quinine.', 'The use of nanocomposite materials in sensor construction enhances sensor performance, including stability, selectivity, and reproducibility.', "Calixarene derivatives' water solubility and functionalization flexibility facilitate their integration into electrochemical sensor platforms for aqueous quinine detection.", 'Verification of sensor performance by multiple analytical techniques (DPV, CV, EIS, H NMR, SEM, FTIR) ensures reliability and robustness of the IDA-based electrochemical sensor system.']}
