{'summary': 'Host-guest interactions that induce changes in electrochemical signals are primarily mediated by non-covalent supramolecular interactions, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, π-π stacking, van der Waals forces, and redox-active host-guest complexation. These interactions can modulate electron transfer, redox chemistry, and signal transduction in electrochemical sensing systems.', 'key_points': ['Types of host-guest interactions that induce changes in electrochemical signals include: hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, π-π stacking interaction, van der Waals interaction, and redox-active host-guest complexation.', 'Host-guest interactions often involve macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8), cyclodextrins (β-CD), calixarenes, pillararenes, and cavitands, which form inclusion complexes with various guest molecules.', 'Electrochemical signal modulation arises from supramolecular host-guest interactions that affect electron transfer, redox chemistry, and conformational changes at the electrode interface.', "Specific examples include quinine displacing methylene blue (MB) from the β-cyclodextrin cavity, altering the electrochemical response (host_guest_displacement: 'quinine displaces MB from beta-CD cavity').", 'Host-guest complexation can be studied and confirmed by techniques such as 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).', 'Host-guest interactions are effective strategies for constructing biomaterials, preparing biological systems, deciphering molecular binding modes, and developing new disease treatments.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest interactions are a subset of supramolecular interactions, which are the basis of response mechanisms in electrochemical sensing.', 'Macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, calixarenes, pillararenes, cavitands) provide hydrophobic or electrostatically active cavities for guest inclusion, enabling selective molecular recognition and signal transduction.', 'Host-guest chemistry typically occurs in aqueous solution and can be analyzed in deuterated solvents such as D2O for NMR studies.', 'Host-guest systems can involve biomacromolecules or cavity-bearing synthetic macrocycles as participants, and are relevant in both cellular environments and synthetic sensing platforms.', 'Electrochemical signal changes can result from guest-induced conformational changes, displacement of redox-active guests, or modulation of the local environment at the electrode surface.', 'The formation of host-guest complexes (e.g., host-guest_complex, inclusion_complex, charge_transfer_complex) is central to the modulation of electrochemical signals.'], 'relationships': ['Host-guest interactions form host-guest complexes, which are the functional units responsible for electrochemical signal modulation (forms_complex: host-guest_complex).', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as CB7 and CB8 are directly involved in host-guest interactions that can be analyzed by fluorescence data, UV-Vis, and 1H NMR spectroscopy (has_host: cb7 OR cb8; is_analyzed_by: fluorescence_data; is_studied_by: uv_vis_spectroscopy, 1h_nmr_spectroscopy).', 'Host-guest displacement (e.g., quinine displacing MB from β-CD) directly alters the electrochemical response, demonstrating the dynamic nature of supramolecular signal transduction.', 'Host-guest chemistry is closely related to the occurrence of supramolecular interactions, which underpin the response mechanisms in electrochemical sensing (is_basis_of: response_mechanism).', 'Host-guest interactions are effective strategies for constructing biomaterials and developing new disease treatments, highlighting their broader significance beyond electrochemical sensing.']}
