{'summary': 'IDA-based electrochemical sensors can be designed using a range of host-guest interactions, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, metal coordination, hydrophobic effects, and supramolecular recognition, each contributing distinct selectivity and binding properties to the sensor platform.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonding: Involves interactions such as receptor–sulfate(SO4)2− binding, with an average hydrogen bond energy of 23.8 kJ/mol (DOI:10.1002/chem.202000739), hydrogen bond distance of 2.1 Å, and significant roles in molecular recognition and anion binding. Hydrogen bonding is among the strongest intermolecular forces but is weakened in water and hard to deploy under biological conditions (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Electrostatic interactions: Electrostatic host-guest interactions occur between charged species (e.g., lysine residue and sulfonate group, methylated lysine and calixarene derivatives), are extremely sensitive to the environment, and can serve as a driving force for guest location (DOI:10.1002/chem.201605394). These interactions are often evaluated by DFT calculations and can be overwhelmed by competing effects (DOI:10.1039/D0QO00649A).', 'Metal coordination: Host-guest systems can utilize metal coordination, particularly with cavitands, to achieve selective binding (DOI:10.1021/acs.joc.1c00794). Supramolecular recognition based on metal complexes can alter sensor properties such as fluorescence (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Hydrophobic effect: Hydrophobic interactions are modeled by synthetic receptors and membranes, driven by the release of high-energy water and influenced by molecular shape (DOI:10.1021/ja0727058, DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259). The hydrophobic effect is illustrated by guest binding data and is increased by apolar chains (DOI:10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02541).', 'Supramolecular recognition: Mechanisms based on host-guest chemistry and metal complexes enable selective and tunable sensor responses, including changes in fluorescence properties (DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Competitive binding: Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) inherently rely on competitive binding, where an analyte displaces an indicator from a host-guest complex, enabling electrochemical signal transduction.', 'Host-guest inclusion complexes: Systems such as beta-cyclodextrin, water-soluble arylazopyrazole, carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6), and deep cavitands are used as hosts in IDA-based sensors, often in aqueous solution (DOI:10.1002/chem.201800587).'], 'background_information': ['IDA-based electrochemical sensors are constructed by integrating indicator displacement assays with electrochemical transduction, leveraging host-guest chemistry for selective analyte recognition.', 'Electrochemical sensors based on IDA exhibit properties such as sensor selectivity, reusability, reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven identical electrodes), and stability (86.47% of original DPV signal retained up to 21 days; negligible change in DPV signal during first 7 days at 4°C).', 'Verification and characterization methods for these sensors include cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS), FTIR, H NMR, and SEM.', 'Host-guest interactions in these systems are often investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and UV-vis spectroscopy (DOI:10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107919).', 'Common hosts and indicators in IDA-based sensors include carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6), safranine T (ST), lucigenin, dye_28, and deep cavitands, with applications in detecting analytes such as trimethylated lysine, caffeine, tryptophan (Trp), nucleotides, and quinine.', 'Hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects are influenced by the solvent environment, with water often attenuating these interactions, while electrostatic interactions are highly sensitive to environmental changes and can be modulated by the presence of charged groups.'], 'relationships': ['Hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, metal coordination, hydrophobic effects, and supramolecular recognition are all mechanisms that can be exploited in host-guest chemistry to achieve selective analyte recognition in IDA-based electrochemical sensors.', 'Competitive binding is the operational principle of IDA, where the analyte competes with an indicator for binding to the host, resulting in a measurable electrochemical signal change.', 'The choice of host (e.g., beta-cyclodextrin, pillararenes, cavitands) and the nature of the host-guest interaction directly influence sensor selectivity, sensitivity, and operational stability.', 'Hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions are often complementary, with hydrophobic effects being enhanced by apolar chains and hydrogen bonding being mediated by functional groups such as hydroxyls and carbonyls.', 'Electrostatic interactions can be modulated by the presence of charged functional groups on both host and guest, and are often evaluated computationally (DFT) or by spectroscopic methods.']}
