{'summary': 'Non-covalent interactions, particularly hydrogen bonds and anion-π interactions, play critical roles in the formation, stability, and selectivity of supramolecular host-guest complexes by mediating molecular recognition, driving self-assembly, and modulating binding affinity and selectivity. Hydrogen bonding is especially significant for selectivity and stabilization, while anion-π interactions, though less documented in the provided data, are recognized as important contributors in specific systems.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonds are among the most relevant non-covalent interactions for selectivity in supramolecular host-guest complex formation ("most relevant" for selectivity).', 'Hydrogen bonding is enabled by polar solvents, methanol, water, and organic solvents (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Hydrogen bonds stabilize both the host-guest complex and specific conformations such as the vase form (DOI: 10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004).', 'Hydrogen bonds are formed between specific functional groups, such as pyridine NH binding sites and carbonyl oxygen

solvent environment, cooperativity, and the presence of polar X-H donors.', 'Host-guest complexation is enthalpy-dominated and reversible, with entropic contributions from desolvation of the host
