{'summary': 'The primary types of supramolecular hosts known to bind anions through anion-π interactions are aromatic macrocycles, particularly calixarenes and their derivatives, which present electron-deficient aromatic surfaces or cavities that facilitate anion-π binding.', 'key_points': ['Aromatic macrocycles, especially calixarenes (including calix[4]arene, calix[6]arene, calix[8]arene, and their sulfonated derivatives such as p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4)), are established supramolecular hosts for anion binding via anion-π interactions.', 'Macrocyclic hosts with electron-deficient aromatic surfaces or cavities, such as aromatic cages and macrocyclic arenes, are specifically designed to promote anion-π interactions.', 'Calixarene-based systems, including calixarene derivatives, calixarene macrocycles, and calixarene receptors, are structurally characterized by hydrophobic cavities lined with aromatic units, which are essential for anion-π recognition.', 'Macrocyclic hosts (macrocyclic host molecules) are a broader class that includes calixarenes, pillararenes, and other aromatic macrocycles capable of anion-π binding, often through the presentation of a π-acidic surface or cavity.', 'The presence of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents on the aromatic rings of these macrocycles can modulate the strength and selectivity of anion-π interactions.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts are artificial receptors developed in supramolecular chemistry to enable host-guest chemistry, with applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, chemosensing, and drug delivery.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are a subclass of supramolecular hosts characterized by a cyclic arrangement of aromatic or heteroaromatic units, often providing a hydrophobic or π-acidic cavity for guest binding.', 'Calixarenes are a prototypical family of macrocyclic hosts, constructed from phenolic units linked by methylene bridges, forming bowl-shaped or vase-shaped cavities that can be functionalized at the upper or lower rim to tune binding properties.', 'Calixarene derivatives and sulfonated calixarenes (e.g., p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene, SC4) are water-soluble and have been widely studied for their ability to bind anions via anion-π interactions, especially in aqueous environments.', 'Macrocyclic hosts often exhibit high symmetry and can be functionalized with charged or hydrophilic groups (e.g., sulfonate, carboxylate, ammonium) to enhance selectivity and solubility for anion binding.', 'The anion-π interaction is a noncovalent binding mode where an anion is stabilized by the quadrupole moment of an electron-deficient aromatic system, and is distinct from other noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding or cation-π interactions.'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes are a type of macrocyclic host and supramolecular host, with subtypes including calixarene derivatives, calixarene macrocycles, and calixarene receptors, all of which can present aromatic surfaces for anion-π interactions.', 'Macrocyclic hosts encompass a range of aromatic macrocycles (e.g., calixarenes, pillararenes, cyclophanes) that can be tailored for anion-π binding by modifying the electronic properties of their aromatic units.', 'Aromatic cages and aromatic macrocycles are structurally related, both providing π-acidic environments for anion binding, and are often derived from or related to calixarene or cyclophane scaffolds.', 'The effectiveness of anion-π binding is influenced by the electronic nature of the aromatic system (electron-deficient vs. electron-rich), the geometry of the host cavity, and the presence of additional functional groups that can participate in cooperative binding.']}
