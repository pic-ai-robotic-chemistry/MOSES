{'summary': 'Host-guest interaction is governed by a complex interplay of non-covalent forces, structural complementarity, thermodynamic parameters, and solvent effects, with hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, and electrostatic interactions being primary determinants. The magnitude and selectivity of these interactions are modulated by the chemical nature and geometry of the host and guest, the medium, and the enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding.', 'key_points': ['Host-guest interaction is a non-covalent binding event between a host (e.g., macrocyclic receptor, cavity-bearing synthetic macrocycle, biomacromolecule) and a guest (e.g., amino acid, peptide, small molecule), resulting in the formation of a host-guest complex (10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081; 10.1002/chem.202000739).', 'The main non-covalent interactions controlling host-guest binding are hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, electrostatic interaction, van der Waals forces, ion-dipole interaction, dipole-dipole interaction, π-π interaction, and metal coordination (10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709; 10.1007/s10847-018-0786-0).', 'Hydrogen bonding is among the strongest and most influential forces, with average hydrogen bond energy reported as 23.8 kJ/mol (10.1002/chem.202000739), and typical hydrogen bond distances in host-guest complexes ranging from 2.1 Å to 2.968 Å (10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028). Hydrogen bonding is weakened in water due to competition with solvent molecules (10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'The hydrophobic effect is a major driving force for molecular association in aqueous solution, favoring the aggregation of nonpolar guests and the exclusion of water molecules.
