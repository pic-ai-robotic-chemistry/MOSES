{'summary': 'An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is an analytical technique in supramolecular chemistry where an indicator dye is displaced from a host (receptor) molecule by an analyte, resulting in a measurable signal that enables detection and quantification of the analyte.', 'key_points': ["Principle: In an IDA, a host molecule (receptor) forms a complex with an indicator dye. Upon introduction of an analyte with higher affinity for the host, the analyte competitively displaces the indicator, leading to a detectable change in the indicator's optical properties (absorbance or fluorescence).", 'Mechanism: The process relies on competitive binding, where the analyte and indicator compete for the same binding site on the receptor. The displacement of the indicator is monitored via changes in absorbance (absorbance_change) or fluorescence (fluorescence_change).', 'Components: Typical components include a receptor (e.g., carboxylato_pillar(6)_arene (WP6), deep_cavitand), an indicator dye (e.g., lucigenin, dye_28, safranine T (ST)), and the analyte (e.g., trimethylated_lysine, caffeine).', 'Detection: The assay is capable of detecting specific analytes such as trimethylated_lysine (DOI:10.1039/C7NR02491F) and is applied for caffeine sensing. Selectivity can be tuned for specific targets (e.g., caffeine, LPA, post-translational modifications in proteins).', 'Assay Location: IDAs can be performed in lipid membrane constructs and living cells (DOI:10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Quantitative Parameters: Association constants (e.g., 2.0 Ã— 10^2 for analyte-receptor binding), selectivity for specific analytes, and measurable optical responses are critical parameters.'], 'background_information': ['IDA is a pattern-based sensing method and a subclass of reporting element techniques in supramolecular chemistry, which focuses on non-covalent host-guest interactions and molecular recognition.', 'Receptors used in IDAs are often macrocyclic or cavitand-based molecules with specific binding sites, exhibiting selectivity mechanisms such as positive charge, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, and hydrophobic effects.', 'Indicators are typically dyes or isoquinoline alkaloids that act as optical reporters, showing changes in absorbance or fluorescence upon displacement from the receptor.', 'Analytes are the target molecules whose presence or concentration is measured; they may be recognized based on isomeric form, charge, or specific chemical modifications (e.g., post-translational modifications in proteins).', 'IDAs are widely used for the detection of biologically relevant molecules, including amino acids, nucleotides, peptides, and small molecule drugs, and are particularly valuable for detecting post-translational modifications and in differential sensing applications.', 'Supramolecular chemistry provides the conceptual and methodological framework for IDAs, emphasizing the design of host-guest systems, molecular recognition, and the use of non-covalent interactions for selective sensing.'], 'relationships': ["The indicator and analyte are competitors for the same binding site on the receptor; the analyte's higher affinity leads to displacement of the indicator.", "The receptor's selectivity and binding affinity are determined by its structural features (e.g., positive charge, hydrogen bonding motifs, macrocyclic architecture) and can be tuned for specific analytes.", 'The measurable signal (absorbance or fluorescence change) is directly linked to the displacement event, providing a quantitative readout of analyte concentration.', 'IDAs integrate principles of competitive binding and supramolecular host-guest chemistry, leveraging the modularity and tunability of synthetic receptors and indicators for diverse sensing applications.', 'The use of IDAs in living cells and lipid membrane constructs demonstrates their biocompatibility and applicability in complex biological environments.', 'The design and optimization of IDAs depend on the interplay between receptor structure, indicator properties, and analyte characteristics, as well as the medium and experimental conditions (e.g., pH, solvent composition).']}
