{'summary': 'Cage molecules and macrocycles are both used as host structures in supramolecular chemistry, with significant overlap in applications such as molecular recognition, host-guest chemistry, and drug delivery, but they differ in structural features and certain specialized uses.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules (including molecular cages and capsules) are defined by a three-dimensional cavity capable of accommodating multiple residues (e.g., indole ring, ala methyl group), and are typically formed by self-assembly processes; they often feature macrocyclic structural motifs.', 'Macrocycles are large ring-shaped molecules with a well-defined cavity, extensively used as hosts in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and supramolecular assemblies. They include classes such as cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararenes, and macrocyclic arenes.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles are used for selective binding of guest molecules, including amino acids, peptides, proteins, drugs, dyes, and biomolecules, often via non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, cation-π, van der Waals, ion-dipole).', 'Common applications for both include: drug delivery, molecular recognition, chemosensing, catalysis, fluorescence switching, nanotechnology, separation, and construction of supramolecular architectures.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are particularly noted for their high symmetry, rigidity, electron-rich or hydrophobic cavities, and ease of functionalization (e.g., with hydrophilic groups, peptides, saccharides, charged moieties), enabling water solubility and selectivity for a wide range of guests, especially electron-deficient molecules.', 'Macrocyclic synthetic receptors and supramolecular macrocyclic compounds are applied in biosensing, therapeutic development, energy production, environmental science, materials science, and life science.', 'Aromatic cages (a motif found in proteins and synthetic hosts) are specialized for cation-π interactions and selective recognition of methylated lysines, with a π-electron-rich, desolvated pocket formed by 2–4 aromatic residues.', 'Macrocyclic sensor arrays have been patented for quantification of methyllysines, demonstrating application in biochemical sensing.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as SCXn (sulfonatocalix[n]arenes) form complexes with cationic surfactants to assemble nanoparticles, showing utility in nanomaterials.', 'Macrocyclic cavitands and containers are used for selective binding of peptides, amino acids, and methylated lysine derivatives, with high affinity in aqueous solution (often in the µM to nM range).'], 'background_information': ['Cage molecules are often constructed via self-assembly and can be considered as three-dimensional analogues of macrocycles, with the ability to encapsulate larger or multiple guest molecules due to their enclosed cavity.', 'Macrocyclic chemistry is a subfield of supramolecular chemistry focused on the synthesis, structure, and function of macrocyclic compounds, with a major emphasis on inclusion phenomena and host-guest interactions.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are a subclass of supramolecular hosts and artificial receptors, with subclasses including macrocyclic arenes, cyclophanes, and disulfide-containing hosts.', 'Water-soluble macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cyclodextrins, calix[n]arenes, pillar[n]arenes, cucurbit[n]urils) are widely used in biological and environmental applications due to their high water solubility and biocompatibility.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are characterized by high symmetry, rigidity, large and electron-rich or hydrophobic cavities, and the presence of functional groups that enable selective binding and molecular recognition.', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies, often based on cyclodextrins or cucurbiturils, are used in bioimaging, photodynamic therapy, light-harvesting energy transfer, and targeted drug delivery.', 'Macrocyclic systems have been developed to improve the therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects of chemotherapy drugs, and to enable controlled drug release.', 'Macrocyclic components can control the aggregation behavior of ICT (intramolecular charge transfer) compounds, affecting photophysical properties and enabling applications in dye chemistry.', 'Macrocyclic hosts are used in the design of supramolecular assemblies, providing a microenvironment that can modulate the properties of encapsulated guests (e.g., fluorescence enhancement, restricted rotation).', 'Macrocyclic hosts and cages are both involved in the formation of host-guest complexes, but cages offer a more enclosed environment, which can lead to higher selectivity or encapsulation of larger guests.'], 'relationships': ['Cage molecules often incorporate macrocyclic motifs as structural elements, and both are formed or utilized in supramolecular self-assembly processes.', 'Macrocyclic hosts and cage molecules both function as molecular containers, but cages provide a fully enclosed cavity, while macrocycles typically offer a more open, ring-like binding site.', 'Aromatic cages represent a specialized motif within both protein binding pockets and synthetic macrocyclic/cage hosts, mediating selective recognition of methylated lysines via cation-π interactions.', 'Macrocyclic hosts and cages both participate in host-guest chemistry, but macrocycles are more commonly used for applications requiring high water solubility, modular functionalization, and integration into sensor arrays or nanomaterials.', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies and macrocyclic synthetic receptors extend the application of macrocycles into complex functional systems for biosensing, therapeutic delivery, and advanced materials.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as SCXn (sulfonatocalix[n]arenes) and their complexes with cationic surfactants illustrate the integration of macrocyclic chemistry into nanotechnology and materials science.', 'Macrocyclic containers and cavitands are closely related to cage molecules in their ability to encapsulate and selectively bind specific guest molecules, with applications in molecular recognition and sensing.']}
