{'summary': "An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is composed of a synthetic receptor (host), an indicator, and an analyte, typically operating via non-covalent interactions in an appropriate solvent or buffer system. The essential components enable the competitive binding mechanism that underpins the assay's sensing function.", 'key_points': ['Core components of an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) include: a synthetic receptor (host), an indicator, and an analyte.', 'The synthetic receptor may be constructed from materials such as beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), poly(N-acetylaniline), or graphene.', 'The indicator is a signaling unit that binds to the synthetic receptor and is displaced upon analyte binding.', 'The analyte can be a metal cation, anion, drug, or biological molecule, serving as the sensing target.', 'The assay is performed in a solvent or buffer, and can be conducted inside live cells (biological location: inside live cells).', 'The interaction type between components is non-covalent.', 'The sensor output is typically optical, utilizing an optical sensor for signal transduction.', 'IDA possesses sensor conversion capability (sensor_conversion_capability: yes), enabling the conversion of molecular recognition events into measurable signals.'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a molecular recognition and sensing strategy rooted in supramolecular chemistry.', "The IDA mechanism relies on competitive binding: the indicator is initially bound to the synthetic receptor, and is displaced upon introduction of the analyte, resulting in a measurable change in the indicator's signal.", 'IDA can be coupled with differential sensing strategies to enhance specificity and sensitivity, as demonstrated in ultrasensitive fluorescence detection of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in aqueous media (see DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'A notable subclass of IDA is the fluorescent indicator displacement assay (F-IDA), which utilizes fluorescence as the signaling modality.', 'The sensing targets for IDA are broad, encompassing metal cations, anions, drugs, and biological molecules, and the assay can be adapted for monitoring specific biological conditions such as hypoxia.', 'IDA is situated within the broader hierarchies of molecular recognition, sensing strategy, and supramolecular chemistry.'], 'relationships': ['The synthetic receptor (host) forms a non-covalent complex with the indicator; upon addition of the analyte, the analyte competitively binds to the receptor, displacing the indicator and generating a detectable signal.', 'The indicator serves as the signaling unit, and its displacement is transduced by an optical sensor to provide the assay output.', 'The choice of receptor material (e.g., beta-cyclodextrin, poly(N-acetylaniline), graphene) influences the selectivity and sensitivity of the assay toward specific analytes.', 'IDA can be performed in live cells, enabling real-time monitoring of analytes in biological environments.', 'IDA may be integrated with differential sensing approaches to improve discrimination among structurally similar analytes (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).']}
