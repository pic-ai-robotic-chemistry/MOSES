{'summary': 'The principal types of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions are calixarenes (including sulfonatocalixarenes), cyclophanes, cucurbiturils, and pillararenes, with pillararenes explicitly documented to utilize cation-π interactions with amine groups.', 'key_points': ['Calixarenes (including calix(4)arene, calix(6)arene, calix(8)arene, and their sulfonated derivatives such as p-sulfonatocalix(4)arene (SC4)) are macrocyclic supramolecular hosts with hydrophobic cavities and electron-rich aromatic surfaces, enabling strong cation-π interactions with cationic guests, particularly methylated lysine and trimethyllysine (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398, 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Pillararenes (e.g., pillar(5)arene, pillar(6)arene, pillar(7)arene) are macrocyclic hosts with electron-rich cavities and are explicitly described as having cation-π interaction capability with amine groups, facilitating selective binding of cationic guests such as methylated lysine (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cyclophanes are synthetic container molecules with aromatic rings arranged to create electron-rich cavities, enabling cation-π interactions with alkylammonium ions and other cationic organic guests (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cucurbiturils (e.g., cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), cucurbit[8]uril (CB8)) are synthetic container molecules with hydrophobic interiors and high affinity for cationic guests, including amino acids and methylated lysine, where cation-π interactions contribute to binding (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'All these host classes are used for molecular recognition of methylated amino acids, peptides, and proteins, with selectivity for methylation state and the ability to discriminate post-translationally methylated partners.'], 'background_information': ['Calixarenes are synthesized by condensation reactions (e.g., formaldehyde with p-alkylphenols under basic conditions) and are highly derivatizable, allowing tuning of cavity size, solubility, and selectivity. They are water-soluble (especially sulfonated derivatives), have bowl-shaped hydrophobic cavities, and are used in biochemistry, chemical biology, drug delivery, and sensor applications (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398, 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Pillararenes possess electron-rich cavities and poor solubility (unless derivatized), and are used for selective recognition of methylated lysine and other cationic analytes. Their cation-π interaction with amine groups is a defining feature for guest binding (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cyclophanes are structurally related to calixarenes and act as synthetic receptors for organic cations, with documented dissociation constants (e.g., 50 μM for certain guests) and water solubility in some derivatives (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Cucurbiturils are macrocyclic hosts with high binding affinity for cationic guests, including methylated lysine, and are used in catalysis, molecular recognition, and as bases for artificial light harvesting systems. Their hydrophobic interiors and carbonyl-lined portals facilitate cation-π and ion-dipole interactions (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'All these hosts are designed for selectivity, often outperforming native reader proteins in binding affinity for methylated targets, and function in physiologically relevant media (e.g., warm, salty water).'], 'relationships': ['Calixarenes, pillararenes, cyclophanes, and cucurbiturils are all macrocyclic or container-type supramolecular hosts with electron-rich aromatic cavities, a structural feature critical for cation-π interaction-based guest binding.', 'Pillararenes are explicitly noted to utilize cation-π interactions with amine groups, while calixarenes and cyclophanes are structurally and functionally related, both enabling cation-π recognition of cationic guests such as alkylammonium ions and methylated lysine.', 'Cucurbiturils, while not always described as classic cation-π hosts, bind cationic guests in a manner where cation-π and ion-dipole interactions are both significant, especially for methylated amino acids.', 'All these host classes are used for selective recognition and discrimination of methylation states in biological targets, with applications in chemical biology, biochemistry, and molecular sensing.']}
