{'summary': 'The essential components of an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) are a synthetic receptor (host), an indicator, and an analyte, typically operating via non-covalent interactions and producing an optical sensor output. Additional components such as buffer, solvent, and specific materials (e.g., beta-cyclodextrin, graphene, poly(N-acetylaniline)) may be included depending on the assay design.', 'key_points': ['An Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) consists of the following core components: synthetic receptor (host), indicator, and analyte.', 'The synthetic receptor (host) is often a synthetic molecule such as beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), poly(N-acetylaniline), or graphene, which binds the indicator via non-covalent interactions.', 'The indicator is a molecule that produces a measurable signal (commonly optical, e.g., fluorescence) upon displacement by the analyte.', 'The analyte is the target molecule that competes with the indicator for binding to the host, resulting in displacement and a change in the sensor output.', 'The assay is typically performed in a buffered aqueous solution, and may be conducted inside live cells.', 'The sensor output is most commonly optical (optical_sensor), enabling detection and quantification of the analyte.', 'The interaction type in IDA is non-covalent, allowing reversible binding and displacement processes.', 'IDA can be coupled with differential sensing strategies for enhanced specificity and sensitivity (see DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).'], 'background_information': ['Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular chemistry-based sensing strategy classified under molecular recognition and sensing_strategy.', 'IDA is used for ultrasensitive fluorescence detection of analytes such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in aqueous media.', 'The sensing targets in IDA can include a wide range of analytes: metal cations, anions, drugs, and biological molecules.', 'The signaling unit in IDA is responsible for transducing the binding event into a measurable signal, often via fluorescence or other optical means.', 'IDA can be performed inside live cells, enabling real-time monitoring of biological processes such as hypoxia.', 'A notable subclass of IDA is the fluorescent indicator displacement assay (F-IDA), which specifically utilizes fluorescence as the sensor output.'], 'relationships': ['The synthetic receptor (host) forms a non-covalent complex with the indicator; upon introduction of the analyte, the analyte displaces the indicator due to higher binding affinity, resulting in a change in the optical signal.', 'The indicator and analyte compete for the same binding site on the host, and the displacement event is transduced by the signaling unit into an optical sensor output.', 'IDA is often coupled with differential sensing, which leverages pattern recognition to distinguish between multiple analytes or closely related species (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'The assay can be adapted for use in live-cell environments, allowing for in situ monitoring of analytes and physiological conditions.']}
