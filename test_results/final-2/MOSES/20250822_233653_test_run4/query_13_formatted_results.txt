{'summary': 'Guest molecules in supramolecular host–guest systems encompass a wide range of chemical entities, including cations, anions, neutral organic molecules, peptides, dyes, and small molecules, characterized by diverse structural motifs and physicochemical properties that enable non-covalent interactions with host molecules.', 'key_points': ['Guest molecules include cations (e.g., ammonium, alkyldiammonium cation, quaternary ammonium salt, n-ethylammonium, n-methylammonium, n,n-dimethylammonium, trimethylammonium), anions, neutral organic molecules (e.g., alkanes, aromatic compounds, alcohols, peptides, amino acids, porphyrins, coumarins, naphthalimides, pyrene derivatives), and inorganic guest molecules.', 'Specific guest molecule classes: aromatic_guest_molecule,

tripeptide, oligopeptide, and water_molecule.', 'Guest molecules often possess functional groups or moieties such as alkyl_chain, benzyl_group, imidazole_functional_group, aromatic_moiety, hydrophilic_side_group, hydrophobic_side_group, and positively-charged_side_group.', 'Guest molecules can be characterized by their amphiphilicity, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, and the presence of specific side groups (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, amphiphilic).', 'Guest molecules are included in hydrophobic_cavity or macrocycle, and can be encapsulated in macrocyclic_host_molecule or

and non-covalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, hydrophobic effects, electrostatic interactions) between host and guest species.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils (e.g., cucurbit(8)uril(CB(8))), and container_compounds are commonly used to encapsulate guest molecules within their hydrophobic cavities.', "Guest molecules can modulate the equilibrium of host–guest systems (e.g., shifting the equilibrium of a 'vase' conformation), and can induce negative_cooperativity, positive_cooperativity, or non_cooperativity in binding events.", 'Guest inclusion can result in the release of high-energy_water_molecule from the host cavity, contributing to the thermodynamics of complexation (entropy_compensation).', 'Guest molecules are often optimized for host binding using computational methods such as density_functional_theory(DFT), and their properties are characterized by UV-vis absorption spectra, titration profiles, and interaction

be in different states: complex_state (bound to host) or free_state (unbound), and their hydration_level and solubility_in_aqueous_solution can be critical for host–guest assembly.'], 'relationships': ['Guest molecules form host-guest_assembly with host molecules, often within hydrophobic_cavity or macrocyclic_host.', 'Guest molecules are encapsulated by macrocyclic_host_molecule or
