{'summary': 'The principal types of supramolecular hosts known to bind anions primarily through anion-π interactions are macrocycles (notably calixarenes, pillararenes, and related aromatic macrocycles), molecular tweezers, and foldamers with electron-deficient aromatic surfaces. These hosts utilize electron-deficient π-systems to engage anions via anion-π interactions, often in combination with other noncovalent forces.', 'key_points': ['Macrocycles such as calixarenes, pillararenes, and their derivatives (e.g., anionic_pillar(5)arene, anionic_pillar(6)arene, sulfonatocalix(4)arene, SCX4_macrocyclic_host) are established supramolecular hosts for anion binding via anion-π interactions, leveraging their electron-deficient aromatic cavities.', 'Molecular tweezers, including carboxylate_molecular_tweezer (MCT), phosphate_molecular_tweezer (MPT), phosphonate_molecular_tweezer (MPnT), and sulfate_molecular_tweezer (MST), are open-chain, semi-rigid hosts with pocket-like, electron-rich aromatic binding sites, decorated with functional groups for interaction and water solubility. These tweezers exhibit high affinity for basic peptides and side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine) and can form self-assembled dimers.', 'Foldamers, such as iodotriazole_foldamer, are water-soluble, possess hydrophobic interiors and hydrophilic outer rims, and are composed of units like 5-iodotriazole, 5-methyltellanyl_triazole, and 1,3-phenylene. These structures provide folded, electron-deficient aromatic surfaces suitable for anion-π binding.', 'Anion receptors operate predominantly in organic solvents, with application in aqueous solution being extremely rare (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Macrocycles and related hosts often feature clearly defined, rigid, or controlled cavities with exposed aromatic surfaces, high preorganization, and can be functionalized at specific sites to tune anion-π binding properties.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts are synthetic analogues inspired by natural proteins, designed via de novo design, and function as sequestration agents in chemical biology and biochemistry (DOI: 10.1039/c6cc04771hHost).', 'Macrocycles are versatile platforms for multivalent systems, can be integrated into sensing scaffolds, nanostructures, and solutions, and are characterized by high preorganization, intrinsic fluorescence, and the ability to form inclusion complexes (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.201800398).', 'Macrocycles such as calixarenes and pillararenes can be modified (e.g., sulfonation, carboxylation) to enhance water solubility and anion affinity, and their binding affinity can range from micromolar to nanomolar depending on the guest and solvent environment.', 'Molecular tweezers are semi-rigid, open-chain hosts with electron-rich aromatic pockets, often incorporating crown ether or perylene bisimide dye (PBI) components, and are decorated with solubilizing groups (e.g., amide, ester, tri(ethylene_glycol)) for aqueous compatibility.', 'Foldamers are composed of repeating aromatic units (e.g., triazole, phenylene), possess hydrophobic interiors and hydrophilic exteriors, and are capable of anion binding and i_sensing in water (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Anion-π interactions are a subset of weak interactions exploited by these hosts, often in synergy with hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effects, and electrostatic interactions to achieve selective anion recognition.'], 'relationships': ['Macrocycles, molecular tweezers, and foldamers are all subclasses of supramolecular hosts and anion receptors, sharing the ability to bind anions via anion-π interactions but differing in structural rigidity, cavity definition, and solubility profiles.', 'Macrocycles (e.g., calixarenes, pillararenes) and molecular tweezers can be further functionalized to modulate their anion-π binding affinity and selectivity, with modifications such as sulfonation or carboxylation enhancing water solubility and anion affinity.', 'Foldamers integrate multiple aromatic units to create extended π-surfaces, increasing the potential for multivalent anion-π interactions and enabling function in aqueous environments.', 'The presence of electron-deficient aromatic surfaces is a unifying feature for anion-π binding across these host types, and the ability to tune cavity size, hydrophobicity, and functional group decoration allows for selective anion recognition.', 'Macrocycles and molecular tweezers can form higher-order assemblies (e.g., self-assembled dimers, inclusion complexes), further diversifying their anion-binding capabilities.']}
