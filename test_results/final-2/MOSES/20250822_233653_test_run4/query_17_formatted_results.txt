{'summary': 'Cage molecules and macrocycles are both central to supramolecular chemistry, with overlapping applications in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, encapsulation, catalysis, and drug delivery. However, macrocycles exhibit a broader diversity of specialized roles, particularly as molecular receptors, hosts, and components in supramolecular assemblies, while cage molecules are distinguished by their ability to accommodate specific guest moieties within a three-dimensional cavity.', 'key_points': ['Cage molecules can accommodate specific guest moieties such as the ala_methyl_group and indole_ring, enabling selective encapsulation and molecular recognition.', 'Macrocycles and macrocyclic compounds function as supramolecular hosts, molecular receptors, and are integral to host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and inclusion complex formation.', 'Macrocyclic hosts have applications in catalysis, chemosensing, drug delivery, fluorescence switching, molecular architecture, nanotechnology, separation, and supramolecular dye lasers.', 'Macrocyclic receptors are crucial for biochemical sensing, modulation of protein interactions, control of protein assembly, and recognition of peptides, proteins, amino acids, and chloride ions.', 'Macrocyclic synthetic receptors are applied in biosensing, drug delivery, and therapeutic development, with binding capabilities for biological targets and biorelevant molecules.', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies are used for bioimaging, light harvesting energy transfer, photodynamic therapy (PDT), targeted drug delivery, and topological morphology control.', 'Both cage molecules and macrocycles participate in host-guest chemistry, molecular recognition, and encapsulation, with macrocycles often forming inclusion complexes and host-guest complexes with a variety of guest molecules (e.g., amino acids, peptides, drugs, aromatic guests).', 'Macrocyclic containers and cavitands specifically bind amino acids, methylated lysine derivatives, trimethyllysine, and peptide sequences.', 'Macrocycles exhibit host-guest properties, recognition functions, and are used to construct supramolecular aggregates and assemblies.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest chemistry involving macrocycles is investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy, 1H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and UV-Vis spectroscopy, and occurs in aqueous solutions and cellular environments.', 'Host-guest complexes formed by macrocyclic hosts (e.g., p-sulfonatocalix(4)arene, cucurbituril) are stabilized by dispersion, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions, and are used as optical sensors and smart functional materials.', 'Molecular recognition by macrocyclic receptors is driven by hydrophobic effects, ion-dipole interactions, electrostatic attraction, and is influenced by cavity size and rigid cone conformation.', 'Encapsulation processes, relevant to both cages and macrocycles, are observed by NMR and fluorescence quenching, and can protect guest molecules from quenching and radiationless transitions.', 'Macrocyclic chemistry is a specialization of supramolecular chemistry, focusing on inclusion phenomena, hydrogen bonding in water, and the design of molecular assemblies and machines.', 'Macrocyclic hosts include subtypes such as calixarene, cucurbituril, cyclodextrin, cyclophane derivatives, pillararene, and triazine-based hosts, each with specific guest affinities and functional group compatibilities.', 'Macrocyclic systems are developed to improve chemotherapy drugs and are involved in the design of supramolecular assemblies for biological and technological applications.', 'Macrocyclic anion receptors, based on pseudocyclopeptides, exhibit anion binding and recognition capabilities.'], 'relationships': ['Both cage molecules and macrocycles serve as hosts in host-guest chemistry, enabling encapsulation and molecular recognition of guest molecules.', 'Macrocycles, due to their structural diversity (e.g., calixarene, cucurbituril, cyclodextrin), provide a wide range of host-guest interactions, with specific subtypes tailored for particular guest molecules or applications.', 'Macrocyclic hosts and receptors are directly involved in molecular recognition processes, often forming stable host-guest complexes with amino acids, peptides, proteins, and small molecules.', 'Encapsulation and inclusion complex formation are common to both cages and macrocycles, but macrocycles are more frequently used in the construction of supramolecular assemblies and as platforms for functional materials (e.g., sensors, drug delivery vehicles).', 'Macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies integrate macrocyclic hosts (e.g., cucurbituril, cyclodextrin) as key components for targeted drug delivery, bioimaging, and energy transfer applications.', 'Host-guest interactions involving macrocycles are characterized by specific binding constants, stoichiometries (e.g., 1:1 complexes), and are stabilized by noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effects, and electrostatic forces.', 'Macrocyclic containers and cavitands extend the host-guest paradigm to selective binding of post-translationally modified amino acids (e.g., methylated lysine derivatives), highlighting the specificity achievable with macrocyclic architectures.']}
