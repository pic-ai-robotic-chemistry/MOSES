{'summary': 'The principal types of supramolecular hosts known to bind guests primarily through cation-π interactions are calixarenes, cyclophanes, cucurbiturils, pillararenes, and crown ethers. These hosts possess π-rich cavities or portals that facilitate selective binding of cationic guests via cation-π interactions.', 'key_points': ['Calixarene, cyclophane, cucurbituril, pillararene, and crown ether are established classes of supramolecular hosts that utilize cation-π interactions as a primary binding mode for guest recognition.', "The descendant list of 'supramolecular_host' includes numerous specific macrocyclic hosts with π-rich environments, such as calix(4)arene, calix(6)arene, calix(n)arene, p-sulfonatocalix(4)arene (SC4), pillar(5)arene, pillar(6)arene, pillar(7)arene, cucurbit(7)uril (CB7), cucurbit(8)uril (CB8), and various cyclophane derivatives.", 'Cation-π interactions are explicitly involved in the binding pockets of these hosts, enabling selective recognition of cationic guests such as ammonium ions, alkali metal cations, and post-translationally methylated amino acid residues (e.g., trimethyllysine).', 'The ontology identifies that supramolecular hosts can have high binding affinity and selectivity for methylated amino acids, peptides, and proteins, often mediated by cation-π interactions.'], 'background_information': ['Supramolecular hosts are compared to proteins and protein counterparts in their ability to act as sequestration agents, particularly in biochemistry and chemical biology applications.', 'These hosts are often created by de novo design to target specific biological molecules, including post-translationally methylated partners, and are used to discriminate between different methylation states.', 'Cation-π interactions are a type of weak interaction, but they play a critical role in the selectivity and affinity of host-guest chemistry, especially in physiologically relevant media.', 'The binding affinity for guests such as trimethyllysine is a key property of these hosts, and competition with native reader proteins is noted in biological contexts.', 'Macrocyclic hosts such as calixarenes, pillararenes, and cucurbiturils are frequently functionalized (e.g., sulfonation, carboxylation, cationic modification) to enhance water solubility and guest selectivity.'], 'relationships': ['Cation-π interactions are directly involved in the binding pockets of supramolecular hosts, paralleling the recognition mechanisms of methyl reader proteins.', 'Supramolecular hosts enable host-guest chemistry by providing π-rich cavities that selectively bind cationic guests through cation-π interactions.', 'There is a functional analogy between supramolecular hosts and biological reader proteins, with both systems utilizing cation-π interactions for selective recognition of methylated biomolecules.', "The selectivity for methylation state and the ability to discriminate between post-translationally methylated partners are emergent properties of the host's π-rich environment and the cation-π interaction mechanism."]}
