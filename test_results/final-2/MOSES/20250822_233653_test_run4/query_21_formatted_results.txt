{'summary': 'The indicator displacement assay (IDA) is capable of detecting a wide range of analytes, including metal ions, small organic molecules, anions, peptides, proteins, and post-translationally modified biomolecules, by exploiting competitive binding interactions with a receptor-indicator complex.', 'key_points': ['IDA-detectable analytes encompass metal ions (e.g., metal_cation, metal_anion), small organic molecules (e.g., acetylcholine(AcCh), paraquat, cocaine, doxorubicin), anions (e.g., chloride_ion(Cl-), sulfate(SO4)2-, phosphate_anion, perrhenate_ion(ReO4-)), peptides (e.g., phosphorylated_peptide, post_translationally_modified_peptide_analyte), proteins (e.g., histone_h3, cytochrome_c, myoglobin, serum_albumin), and a broad spectrum of amino acids and their derivatives (e.g., L_lysine, L_tryptophan, methylated_lysine, monomethyllysine(Kme_1), dimethyllysine(Kme_2), trimethyllysine(Kme_3)).', 'Analytes include both charged (cationic_amino_acid, anion, cation) and neutral species (neutral_nonaromatic_amino_acid, organic_compound), as well as zwitterionic forms (zwitterionic_form, sarcosine_zwitterion).', 'IDA can detect post-translationally modified biomolecules, such as methylated_lysine, acetylated_histone_h4kac, and phosphopeptides, as well as noncanonical and modified amino acids (e.g., n-methylated_amino_acid, noncanonical_amino_acid).', 'Analytes may be non-fluorescent_analyte or weakly_fluorescent_analyte, indicating that IDA is suitable for detecting analytes regardless of their intrinsic fluorescence.', 'Quantitative property: The association_constant for analyte-receptor complexes can be as low as 2.0 Ã— 10^2, indicating moderate binding affinity.', 'Analyte stability is preserved under IDA conditions (DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F).', 'Analyte-receptor complexes can adopt parallel or perpendicular conformations (complex_conformation: parallel, perpendicular) with macrocyclic hosts such as calixarene.', 'Experimental conditions for IDA can include 95% water/5% deuterium oxide at pH 1.'], 'background_information': ['An analyte in the context of IDA is defined as a molecule that is detected or bound by a receptor, often through ionic or host-guest interactions, and can include a wide variety of chemical entities such as amino acids, peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and drugs.', 'Receptors in IDA possess affinity for specific analytes and can recognize them based on isomeric form, charge, or post-translational modification.', 'The IDA mechanism relies on the competitive displacement of a pre-bound indicator (often a fluorescent_indicator) from a receptor by the target analyte, resulting in a measurable signal change.', 'Analytes can interact with macrocyclic hosts (e.g., calixarene) via parallel or perpendicular complexation, and may also be recognized by metal centers (e.g., copper_center, DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02541).', 'IDA is applicable in diverse environments, including aqueous_solution, hela_cell, and lipid_environment, and is used for the detection and enrichment of analytes in proteomics and biomarker discovery.', 'Analytes are not altered by certain detection platforms (e.g., t_rex_bead, DOI: 10.1039/C7NR02491F), ensuring the integrity of the target molecule during analysis.'], 'relationships': ['Analytes are recognized by specific receptors, such as copper_center and calixarene, forming stabilized complexes that can be parallel or perpendicular in orientation.', 'Analytes act as competitors for binding_site occupancy, displacing a fluorescent_indicator in the IDA process.', 'Analytes are present in various biological and chemical environments (aqueous_solution, hela_cell, lipid_environment), demonstrating the versatility of IDA.', 'The interaction of analytes with macrocyclic hosts (e.g., calixarene) and metal centers (e.g., copper_center) underpins the selectivity and sensitivity of IDA.', 'IDA is capable of detecting both non-fluorescent and weakly fluorescent analytes, expanding its applicability to a wide range of chemical species.']}
