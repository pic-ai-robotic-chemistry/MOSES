{'summary': 'Quinine is a hydrophobic alkaloid with low solubility in water, primarily used as an antimalarial agent and as a bittering agent, and is characterized by specific analytical, physicochemical, and toxicological properties.', 'key_points': ['Quinine is classified as an alkaloid and is a component derived from cinchona tree bark.', 'It exhibits low solubility in water and is hydrophobic.', 'Quinine is dissolved in ethanol for stock solutions, typically at a concentration of 10 mM, and can be diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS).', 'The molar ratio of quinine with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is 1:1.', 'Analytical recovery rates for quinine range from 98.3% to 109.3%.', 'A slight proton peak shift is observed in NMR analysis.', 'Incubation time in relevant assays is 40 minutes.', 'Quinine is used for the treatment of malaria, lupus, arthritis, and muscle cramps, and as a bittering agent.', 'Adverse health effects induced by quinine include thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, blindness, and acute kidney injury.', 'In detection schemes, quinine serves as a target analyte.'], 'background_information': ['Quinine is analyzed by a range of techniques, including electrochemical techniques, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), colorimetric assays, fluorescence assays, and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).', 'It is determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and detected by quantitative electrochemical methods, ion transfer voltammetry (ITV), and electrochemiluminescence biosensors.', 'The role of quinine as a bittering agent is significant in the food and beverage industry, particularly in tonic water.', "Quinine's hydrophobicity and low aqueous solubility influence its formulation and analytical handling.", "The parent class of quinine is 'alkaloid', and it has a child class, β-quinine."], 'relationships': ['Quinine is structurally and functionally related to alkaloids and is sourced from cinchona tree bark.', 'It is commonly formulated in ethanol due to its hydrophobic nature and low water solubility.', 'The 1:1 molar ratio with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) suggests inclusion complex formation, which may enhance solubility or modify analytical properties.', "Quinine's adverse health effects are directly linked to its pharmacological and toxicological profile, necessitating careful monitoring in therapeutic and food applications.", 'The use of multiple analytical techniques (electrochemical, chromatographic, spectrometric) reflects the need for sensitive and specific detection of quinine in complex matrices.']}
