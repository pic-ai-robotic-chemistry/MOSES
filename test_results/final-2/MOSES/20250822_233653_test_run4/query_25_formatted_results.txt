{'summary': 'Multiple types of host-guest interactions—including hydrogen bonding, ion-dipole interactions, cavity interactions, dipole-dipole interactions, and size/shape complementarity—can induce changes in electrochemical signals by modulating the physicochemical properties of the system. These interactions are central to supramolecular host-guest chemistry and are exploited in electrochemical sensing platforms.', 'key_points': ['Host-guest interactions that can induce changes in electrochemical signals include: hydrogen bonding, ion-dipole interaction, cavity interaction, dipole-dipole interaction, and size/shape complementarity (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).', 'Host-guest interactions are characterized by dynamic and rapid exchange states, and can be light-responsive (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201800587).', 'These interactions result in the formation of host-guest complexes, which can modulate chemical and physicochemical properties such as binding affinity, binding free energy, and association constant (Ka, ka) (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479; 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Host-guest interactions can lead to observable outcomes such as dye displacement, fluorescence modulation, pKa shift, and stimulus-responsive release, all of which can be transduced into electrochemical signals.', 'Host-guest systems are often studied in aqueous media or solution, and involve desolvation processes of both the host cavity and the guest (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709; 10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479).', 'Common hosts include cucurbiturils (CB(7), Q(8)), cyclodextrins (β-CD), and calixarenes, while guests can be amino acids, peptides, viologens, and other small molecules.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest interactions are a foundational aspect of supramolecular chemistry, underpinning the design of electrochemical sensors and stimulus-responsive supramolecular self-assembly (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479).', 'These interactions are investigated and characterized using techniques such as 1H NMR spectroscopy, 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), fluorescence spectroscopy, UV absorption spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulation (DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00429; 10.1002/chem.202000739; 10.1016/j.tetlet.2017.05.095).', 'Host-guest chemistry is typically performed in aqueous environments, which is relevant for both biological and analytical applications (DOI: 10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'The modulation of electrochemical signals by host-guest interactions is often exploited in the development of electrochemical sensors and platforms for biomedical applications.', 'Host-guest complexes can be highly specific, with association constants (Ka) and binding free energies providing quantitative measures of interaction strength (DOI: 10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028; 10.1016/j.molliq.2021.115479).', 'Desolvation of the host cavity and/or guest is a critical step in complex formation, influencing the thermodynamics and kinetics of the interaction (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01709).'], 'relationships': ['Host-guest interactions (hydrogen bonding, ion-dipole, cavity, dipole-dipole, size/shape complementarity) directly modulate the physicochemical properties of the system, which in turn affect electrochemical signal transduction.', 'The formation of host-guest complexes is associated with measurable changes in binding affinity, binding free energy, and association constants, which can be correlated with changes in electrochemical signals.', 'Desolvation processes and the dynamic nature of host-guest interactions contribute to the modulation of electrochemical properties.', 'Specific hosts (e.g., cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins) and guests (e.g., amino acids, peptides, viologens) are selected based on their ability to form stable complexes and induce measurable changes in electrochemical signals.', 'Experimental and computational methods (NMR, ITC, ESI-MS, molecular dynamics, quantum chemical calculations) are used to elucidate the mechanisms and quantify the effects of host-guest interactions on electrochemical signal modulation.']}
