{'summary': 'In an electrochemical sensor employing an Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA), quinine displaces methylene blue (MB) from the β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) cavity via competitive host–guest interactions, resulting in a measurable change in the electrochemical signal. This displacement is driven by the higher binding affinity of quinine for β-CD compared to MB, and is the basis for selective quinine detection.', 'key_points': ['Methylene blue (MB) forms a host–guest inclusion complex with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), occupying the β-CD cavity through non-covalent interactions.', 'Quinine also forms a 1:1 inclusion complex with β-CD, as indicated by the molar ratio (1:1 with β-CD) and is characterized as hydrophobic, favoring encapsulation within the hydrophobic β-CD cavity.', "Upon introduction, quinine competitively displaces MB from the β-CD cavity due to its higher binding affinity, as evidenced by the property: 'methylene blue (MB) is displaced by quinine' and 'MB is replaced by quinine' in β-CD.", 'The displacement of MB by quinine is mediated by host–guest interactions, specifically the competitive binding of quinine to the β-CD cavity, which is the recognition element in the IDA strategy.', 'This displacement event leads to a change in the electrochemical signal (e.g., reduction peak current, ΔI_MB), which is quantitatively correlated with quinine concentration.', 'The electrochemical sensor platform is constructed using a nanocomposite (e.g., β-CD-poly(N-acetylaniline)-reduced graphene oxide-glassy carbon electrode), which enhances the enrichment and signal transduction of MB and quinine.', 'The IDA-based sensor demonstrates high selectivity for quinine over common interfering molecules, with superior sensor reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven electrodes), stability (86.47% of original DPV signal retained up to 21 days at 4°C), and reusability.'], 'background_information': ['β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a cyclic oligosaccharide composed of D-glucose units linked by α-1,4-glycosidic bonds, forming a hydrophobic cavity suitable for inclusion of hydrophobic guest molecules such as MB and quinine.', 'Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a supramolecular analytical chemistry technique where an indicator (MB) is initially bound to a host (β-CD); upon addition of an analyte (quinine), the indicator is displaced, resulting in a measurable signal change.', 'The electrochemical sensor is typically verified by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).', 'Quinine is an alkaloid with low water solubility, typically dissolved in ethanol or phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for sensor applications, and is detected by quantitative electrochemical methods such as DPV.', 'The IDA strategy is widely used for the detection of various analytes, including drugs and biological molecules, due to its modularity and selectivity, and can be applied in live cell and lipid membrane constructs.'], 'relationships': ['MB and quinine both form inclusion complexes with β-CD, but quinine has a higher binding affinity, enabling it to displace MB from the β-CD cavity.', 'The displacement of MB by quinine is the recognition event in the IDA, directly linking quinine concentration to the electrochemical signal change (ΔI_MB, reduction peak current).', 'The nanocomposite electrode (β-CD-poly(N-acetylaniline)-reduced graphene oxide-glassy carbon) enhances the host–guest interaction and signal transduction efficiency.', 'Sensor performance (selectivity, reproducibility, stability, reusability) is directly related to the robustness of the host–guest chemistry and the nanocomposite platform.', 'The IDA mechanism is generalizable to other analytes that can competitively bind to β-CD, demonstrating the versatility of the host–guest recognition approach in supramolecular electrochemical sensing.']}
