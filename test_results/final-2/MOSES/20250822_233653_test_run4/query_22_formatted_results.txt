{'summary': 'IDA-based electrochemical sensors can be designed using a range of host-guest interactions, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interactions, and metal coordination, as well as competitive binding mechanisms central to indicator displacement assays.', 'key_points': ['Host-guest interactions in IDA-based electrochemical sensors encompass non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interactions, and metal coordination.', 'Competitive binding is a fundamental mechanism in indicator displacement assays (IDAs), where an analyte displaces an indicator dye from a host molecule, generating a measurable electrochemical signal.', 'Host molecules used in these systems include deep cavitands, carboxylato pillar(6)arene (WP6), cucurbiturils (CB7, CB8), and β-cyclodextrin (CD), which can form host-guest complexes with various guest analytes (e.g., quinine, tryptophan, trimethylated lysine, 7-DCCAE).', 'Electrochemical sensors constructed via IDA utilize host-guest recognition to achieve high selectivity, reproducibility, reusability, and stability, with performance metrics such as 86.47% DPV signal retention over 21 days and a relative standard deviation of 2.06% across seven electrodes.', 'Host-guest interactions are studied and verified using techniques such as 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence data, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), FTIR, and SEM.'], 'background_information': ['Host-guest interaction is a type of molecular recognition and binding between a host molecule (e.g., CB7, CB8, β-cyclodextrin, deep cavitand) and a guest molecule (e.g., 7-DCCAE, quinine, tryptophan), forming a host-guest complex that can be exploited for sensing applications.', 'Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) are analytical techniques where a host binds an indicator dye, and the displacement of the dye by a guest (analyte) is used to detect the analyte via a measurable signal, including electrochemical readouts.', 'Host-guest interactions are effective strategies for preparing biological systems, constructing biomaterials, and deciphering molecular binding modes, and can occur in environments such as lipid membrane constructs, living cells, and aqueous solutions (e.g., D2O).', 'Recognition elements and indicator dyes used in IDA-based sensors include lucigenin, dye_28, and safranine T (ST), with selectivity demonstrated for targets such as caffeine and trimethylated lysine.', 'Host-guest chemistry is investigated using methods such as H NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and is applicable in aqueous solutions (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201800587, 10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107919).'], 'relationships': ['Host-guest interactions are a subclass of molecular recognition and non-covalent interactions, with specific systems such as acridine_scx4_system and acridinium_ion_scx4_system as descendants.', 'IDA-based electrochemical sensors are constructed by integrating indicator displacement assays with electrochemical detection platforms, leveraging the competitive binding between host, indicator, and analyte.', 'Host-guest displacement (e.g., quinine displacing methylene blue from β-cyclodextrin) is a direct mechanism for signal generation in IDA-based sensors.', 'The selectivity and sensitivity of electrochemical sensors are directly linked to the specificity of the host-guest interaction and the competitive binding dynamics within the IDA framework.', 'Host-guest interactions can be analyzed in D2O and are effective for developing new disease treatments and constructing biomaterials (DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2018.05.081).']}
