{'summary': 'Anion binding by calixarenes containing pyrrole groups is primarily mediated by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and anion–π interactions, with hydrogen bonds involving pyrrole NH groups being most relevant for selectivity.', 'key_points': ['Hydrogen bonding is the most relevant non-covalent interaction for anion binding by calixarene–pyrrole systems, with hydrogen bonds typically formed between the pyrrole NH binding site and the anion (relevance for selectivity: most relevant).', 'Hydrogen bond distances in such systems are quantitatively reported as 2.508 Å, 2.809 Å, 2.963 Å, 2.852 Å, 2.911 Å, and 2.968 Å (10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.028).', 'Hydrogen bonds are validated by atoms-in-molecules analysis and reduced density gradients analysis (10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Electrostatic interactions also contribute, particularly between charged head groups or functionalized calixarene moieties and the anion; these are described as a driving force for guest location but are less relevant for selectivity than hydrogen bonding (10.1002/chem.201605394).', 'Electrostatic interactions are extremely sensitive to the environment and can be evaluated by DFT calculation (10.1016/j.gresc.2021.03.004; 10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b07925).', 'Anion–π interactions are implicated as a specific non-covalent interaction, especially relevant for aromatic systems such as pyrrole-containing calixarenes.', 'Anion binding is also mediated by sigma-hole interactions and enabled by the hydrophobic concavity of the calixarene cavity (10.1021/jacs.9b00148; 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).'], 'background_information': ['Calixarenes are macrocyclic, supramolecular hosts with a hydrophobic cavity and are easily derivatized to introduce functional groups such as pyrrole, enhancing their anion binding properties (10.1007/s00706-021-02736-4).', 'The bowl-shaped hydrophobic cavity of calixarenes provides a concave environment that can encapsulate anions, facilitating non-covalent interactions (10.1021/jo502825z).', 'Molecular recognition by calixarene–pyrrole systems is governed by weak interactions and is influenced by cavity size and rigid cone conformation (10.1039/C7SC04989G).', 'Hydrogen bonding is enabled by polar solvents, methanol, water, and organic solvents, and is limited in high-energy water environments (10.1002/cbic.201800398; 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Electrostatic interactions are often associated with sulfonate or other charged groups on the calixarene, and their strength can be overwhelmed or modulated by solute–solvent reorganization entropy (10.1039/D0QO00649A; 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12259).', 'Anion binding stoichiometry can be complex (e.g., 2:1 receptor:I−) and is often studied by molecular dynamics simulation (10.1021/jacs.9b00148).', 'Molecular recognition in these systems is a specialization of supramolecular chemistry and is favored in aqueous media, with electrostatic attraction as a primary driving force (10.1021/jo502825z).'], 'relationships': ['Hydrogen bonds between pyrrole NH groups and anions are the primary determinant of selectivity in calixarene–pyrrole anion binding.', 'Electrostatic interactions, while contributing to guest location, are less relevant for selectivity compared to hydrogen bonding, and their strength is highly environment-dependent.', 'Anion–π interactions are facilitated by the aromatic nature of pyrrole and the hydrophobic concavity of the calixarene cavity, providing additional stabilization for anion binding.', 'Sigma-hole interactions and hydrophobic effects further enable and mediate anion binding within the calixarene cavity.', 'The overall binding process is a result of the interplay between hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and anion–π interactions, modulated by the structural features and environment of the calixarene–pyrrole system.']}
