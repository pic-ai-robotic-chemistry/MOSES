    "template": "### **Test #{question_number}: Chemical Knowledge and Reasoning: Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) System**\n\n**Scenario Description**\n\nAn Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) is a powerful sensing method based on supramolecular chemistry, widely used for the detection of various analytes. A typical IDA system consists of three core components:\n\n1.  **Host (A):** A molecule possessing a recognition cavity or binding site.\n2.  **Indicator (B):** A guest molecule that exhibits a signal response (e.g., in its color or fluorescence).\n3.  **Analyte (C):** The target guest molecule to be detected.\n\nThe principle of operation involves two steps:\n\n1.  The Host (A) and Indicator (B) bind to form a supramolecular complex, `A·B`. This binding event causes a significant change in the indicator's signal (e.g., fluorescence quenching or a color change).\n2.  When the Analyte (C) is introduced, it competes for the host's cavity. If C binds to A more strongly than B does, it will displace the indicator, forming a new complex, `A·C`, and releasing the free indicator B. This displacement restores the indicator's signal to its original state, thus enabling the detection of the analyte C.\n\n------\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nA given IDA system consists of the following components:\n\n* **Known Component 1:** {known_comp1_name_and_role}\n* **Known Component 2:** {known_comp2_name_and_role}\n* **Unknown Component:** {unknown_comp_role}\n\nIn this system, one component is now considered unknown.\n\n------\n\n**Your Task**\n\nFrom the options provided below, select the most suitable chemical substance to serve as the **Unknown Component** in the system.\n\n**Options:**\n\n{options}\n\n------\n\n**Instructions for Analysis and Response**\n\nTo fully assess your chemical knowledge and logical reasoning, you are required to follow the steps below in your response:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Known Components:** First, please briefly analyze the key chemical properties of the two known components provided in the problem (e.g., molecular structure, size, shape, charge characteristics, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, functional groups, and their typical features as a host or guest).\n2.  **Define the Requirements for the Unknown Component:** Second, based on the principles of IDA and the properties of the known components, clearly define the critical chemical characteristics that the **Unknown Component** must possess for the entire assay to function successfully.\n    * *(If the unknown is a guest, B or C):* For example, what are the requirements for its binding affinity with Host A relative to the other guest? What specific size, charge, or structural features are necessary for effective binding or displacement? If it is the indicator, what signal-response properties must it have?\n    * *(If the unknown is the host, A):* For example, to bind the given guests, what size, shape, and chemical environment (e.g., hydrophobicity, charge) must its cavity possess? What solubility properties are required for it to function, presumably in an aqueous phase?\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option Systematically:** Next, please rigorously evaluate **each option** from the list. Provide a detailed explanation of why it is suitable or unsuitable to serve as the unknown component.\n    * **Crucial Requirement:** For any unsuitable option, you must justify its exclusion from a **fundamental, conceptual perspective**, such as its **chemical category, physical state, molecular scale, charge properties, solubility, or core function.** Clearly articulate *why* it is incorrect.\n4.  **State Your Final Conclusion:** Finally, state your definitive choice and briefly summarize the core reasoning for its selection.",
