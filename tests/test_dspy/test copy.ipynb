    "###### How electron donation and withdrawal change chemical shifts  \\nWe can get an idea of the effect of electron distribution by looking at a series of benzene rings\\nwith the same substituent in the 1 and 4 positions. This pattern makes all four hydrogens on\\nthe ring identical. Here are a few compounds listed in order of chemical shift: largest shift\\n(lowest fi eld; most deshielded) fi rst. Conjugation is shown by the usual curly arrows, and\\ninductive effects by a straight arrow by the side of the group. Only one hydrogen atom and\\none set of arrows are shown.  \\nConjugation, as discussed in\\nChapter 7, is felt through π bonds,\\nwhile inductive effects are the\\nresult of electron withdrawal or\\ndonation felt simply by polarization\\nof the σ bonds of the molecule.\\nSee p. 135.  \\nthe effect of electron-withdrawing groups\\nby conjugation  \\nby inductive effects  \\n**H**  \\n**O**  \\n**O**  \\n**HO**  \\n**N**  \\nδH 8.48 δH 8.10 **C** δH 8.10 δH 8.07 δH 7.78  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\n**O**  \\n**OH**  \\n**C**  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\n**H**  \\n**F** **F**  \\n**F**  \\nThe largest shifts come from groups that withdraw electrons by conjugation. Nitro is the\\nmost powerful—this should not surprise you as we saw the same in non-aromatic compounds\\nin both [13]C and [1]H NMR spectra. Then come the carbonyl and nitrile group followed by groups\\nshowing simple inductive withdrawal. CF3 is an important example of this kind of group—\\nthree fl uorine atoms combine to exert a powerful effect.  \\n-----  \\nIn the middle of our sequence, around the position of benzene itself at 7.27 ppm, come\\nthe halogens, whose inductive electron withdrawal and lone pair donation are nearly\\nbalanced.  \\nbalance between withdrawal by inductive effect and donation of lone pairs by conjugation  \\n**I** δH 7.40 **Br** δH 7.32 δH 7.27 **Cl** δH 7.24 **F** δH 7.00  \\n**I**  \\n**Br**  \\n**Cl**  \\n**F**  \\nAlkyl groups are weak inductive donators, but the groups which give the most shielding—\\nperhaps surprisingly—are those containing the electronegative atoms O and N. Despite being\\ninductively electron withdrawing (the C–O and C–N σ bonds are polarized with δ + C), on\\nbalance conjugation of their lone pairs with the ring (as you saw on p. 278) makes them net\\nelectron donors. They increase the shielding at the ring hydrogens. Amino groups are the best.\\nNote that one nitrogen-based functional group (NO2) is the best electron withdrawer while\\nanother (NH2) is the best electron donor.  \\nthe effect of electron-donating groups  \\nby inductive effect  \\nbalance between withdrawal by inductive effect and donation\\nof lone pairs by conjugation—electron donation wins  \\n**H**  \\nδH 7.03  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\n**CH3**  \\nδH 6.80 **O**  \\n**H** **H**  \\nδH 6.59 **N**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 6.35  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\n**CH3**  \\n**O**  \\n**CH3**  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\nδH 7.27  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 7.27  \\nδH 5.68  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 5.68  \\n**O**  \\nδH 6.0  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 7.0  \\nδH 4.65  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 6.35  \\nAs far as the donors with lone pairs are concerned (the halogens plus O and N), two factors\\nare important—the size of the lone pairs and the electronegativity of the element. If we look\\nat the four halides at the top of this page the lone pairs are in 2p (F), 3p (Cl), 4p (Br), and 5p (I)\\norbitals. In all cases the orbitals on the benzene ring are 2p so the fl uorine orbital is of the\\nright size to interact well and the others too large. Even though fl uorine is the most electronegative, it is still the best donor. The others don’t pull so much electron density away, but\\nthey can’t give so much back either.\\nIf we compare the fi rst row of the p block elements—F, OH, and NH2—all have lone pairs\\nin 2p orbitals so now electronegativity is the only variable. As you would expect, the most\\nelectronegative element, F, is now the weakest donor.\n",

      "Example({'context': \" 3. When orbitals of identical energy (degenerate orbitals) are available, elec- trons initially occupy these orbitals singly and with parallel spins. This rule means that we must place electrons singly in each orbital with parallel spins before pairing them to ensure that Hund's rule is followed. A simpli- fied statement of Hund's rule is that, for a given configuration, the arrange- ment having the maximum number of parallel spins is lower in energy than any other arrangement arising from the same configuration. This behavior can be rationalized as follows. Because electrons all carry the same electric charge, if the available orbitals all have the same energy, then by placing  them in different orbitals the electrons are spatially as far apart as possible. Why is the atom's energy lower when the electrons' spins are parallel? The answer to this question may seem odd: Electrons with parallel spins repel each other more, and thus shield each other less, than if their spins were  Opposite. Thus, with the spins parallel, the attraction of each electron to the nucleus is greater than if the electrons had opposite spins. The overall effect is that, for a set of degenerate orbitals, having electrons in different orbitals with their spins parallel lowers the total energy of the atom.\\\\* \"}) (input_keys={'context'})\n"

    "###### How electron donation and withdrawal change chemical shifts  \\nWe can get an idea of the effect of electron distribution by looking at a series of benzene rings\\nwith the same substituent in the 1 and 4 positions. This pattern makes all four hydrogens on\\nthe ring identical. Here are a few compounds listed in order of chemical shift: largest shift\\n(lowest fi eld; most deshielded) fi rst. Conjugation is shown by the usual curly arrows, and\\ninductive effects by a straight arrow by the side of the group. Only one hydrogen atom and\\none set of arrows are shown. \n",

    "\\nConjugation, as discussed in\\nChapter 7, is felt through π bonds,\\nwhile inductive effects are the\\nresult of electron withdrawal or\\ndonation felt simply by polarization\\nof the σ bonds of the molecule.\\nSee p. 135.  \\nthe effect of electron-withdrawing groups\\nby conjugation  \\nby inductive effects  \\n**H**  \\n**O**  \\n**O**  \\n**HO**  \\n**N**  \\nδH 8.48 δH 8.10 **C** δH 8.10 δH 8.07 δH 7.78  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\n**O**  \\n**OH**  \\n**C**  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\n**H**  \\n**F** **F**  \\n**F**  \\nThe largest shifts come from groups that withdraw electrons by conjugation. \n",

    "Nitro is the\\nmost powerful—this should not surprise you as we saw the same in non-aromatic compounds\\nin both [13]C and [1]H NMR spectra. Then come the carbonyl and nitrile group followed by groups\\nshowing simple inductive withdrawal. CF3 is an important example of this kind of group—\\nthree fl uorine atoms combine to exert a powerful effect.  \\n-----  \\nIn the middle of our sequence, around the position of benzene itself at 7.27 ppm, come\\nthe halogens, whose inductive electron withdrawal and lone pair donation are nearly\\nbalanced.  \\nbalance between withdrawal by inductive effect and donation of lone pairs by conjugation  \\n**I** δH 7.40 **Br** δH 7.32 δH 7.27 **Cl** δH 7.24 **F** δH 7.00  \\n**I**  \\n**Br**  \\n**Cl**  \\n**F**  \n",

       "    context='\\n###### How electron donation and withdrawal change chemical shifts  \\nWe can get an idea of the effect of electron distribution by looking at a series of benzene rings\\nwith the same substituent in the 1 and 4 positions. This pattern makes all four hydrogens on\\nthe ring identical. Here are a few compounds listed in order of chemical shift: largest shift\\n(lowest fi eld; most deshielded) fi rst. Conjugation is shown by the usual curly arrows, and\\ninductive effects by a straight arrow by the side of the group. Only one hydrogen atom and\\none set of arrows are shown.  \\nConjugation, as discussed in\\nChapter 7, is felt through π bonds,\\nwhile inductive effects are the\\nresult of electron withdrawal or\\ndonation felt simply by polarization\\nof the σ bonds of the molecule.\\nSee p. 135.  \\nthe effect of electron-withdrawing groups\\nby conjugation  \\nby inductive effects  \\n**H**  \\n**O**  \\n**O**  \\n**HO**  \\n**N**  \\nδH 8.48 δH 8.10 **C** δH 8.10 δH 8.07 δH 7.78  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\n**O**  \\n**OH**  \\n**C**  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\n**H**  \\n**F** **F**  \\n**F**  \\nThe largest shifts come from groups that withdraw electrons by conjugation. Nitro is the\\nmost powerful—this should not surprise you as we saw the same in non-aromatic compounds\\nin both [13]C and [1]H NMR spectra. Then come the carbonyl and nitrile group followed by groups\\nshowing simple inductive withdrawal. CF3 is an important example of this kind of group—\\nthree fl uorine atoms combine to exert a powerful effect.  \\n-----  \\nIn the middle of our sequence, around the position of benzene itself at 7.27 ppm, come\\nthe halogens, whose inductive electron withdrawal and lone pair donation are nearly\\nbalanced.  \\nbalance between withdrawal by inductive effect and donation of lone pairs by conjugation  \\n**I** δH 7.40 **Br** δH 7.32 δH 7.27 **Cl** δH 7.24 **F** δH 7.00  \\n**I**  \\n**Br**  \\n**Cl**  \\n**F**  \\nAlkyl groups are weak inductive donators, but the groups which give the most shielding—\\nperhaps surprisingly—are those containing the electronegative atoms O and N. Despite being\\ninductively electron withdrawing (the C–O and C–N σ bonds are polarized with δ + C), on\\nbalance conjugation of their lone pairs with the ring (as you saw on p. 278) makes them net\\nelectron donors. They increase the shielding at the ring hydrogens. Amino groups are the best.\\nNote that one nitrogen-based functional group (NO2) is the best electron withdrawer while\\nanother (NH2) is the best electron donor.  \\nthe effect of electron-donating groups  \\nby inductive effect  \\nbalance between withdrawal by inductive effect and donation\\nof lone pairs by conjugation—electron donation wins  \\n**H**  \\nδH 7.03  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\n**CH3**  \\nδH 6.80 **O**  \\n**H** **H**  \\nδH 6.59 **N**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 6.35  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\n**CH3**  \\n**O**  \\n**CH3**  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\nδH 7.27  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 7.27  \\nδH 5.68  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 5.68  \\n**O**  \\nδH 6.0  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 7.0  \\nδH 4.65  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 6.35  \\nAs far as the donors with lone pairs are concerned (the halogens plus O and N), two factors\\nare important—the size of the lone pairs and the electronegativity of the element. If we look\\nat the four halides at the top of this page the lone pairs are in 2p (F), 3p (Cl), 4p (Br), and 5p (I)\\norbitals. In all cases the orbitals on the benzene ring are 2p so the fl uorine orbital is of the\\nright size to interact well and the others too large. Even though fl uorine is the most electronegative, it is still the best donor. The others don’t pull so much electron density away, but\\nthey can’t give so much back either.\\nIf we compare the fi rst row of the p block elements—F, OH, and NH2—all have lone pairs\\nin 2p orbitals so now electronegativity is the only variable. As you would expect, the most\\nelectronegative element, F, is now the weakest donor.\\n',\n",

To improve, additional object properties should be added to represent these interactions, ensuring a more comprehensive representation of chemical shifts.\n",
      "Ontology Structure: The ontology does not fully span all levels of chemical granularity mentioned in the text, particularly regarding the detailed interactions of lone pairs and specific inductive/conjugative effects. Additionally, while the ontology forms a coherent knowledge graph, it could benefit from more explicit relationships to capture the balance between different electron effects. Improvements could include adding entities or properties to represent these nuanced interactions and effects.\n",
