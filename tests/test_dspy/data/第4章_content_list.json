The heart of the calculation, shown in blue in Figure 4-3, is  conversion from the number of moles of A to the number of moles of B using a factor based on stoichiometric coefficients from the balanced chemical equation—that is, (stoichiometric coefficient of B)/(stoichiometric coefficient of A). Example 4-2 was a single-step calculation requiring only the stoichio- metric factor. Examples 4-3 through 4-6 require additional steps, both before and after the stoichiometric factor is employed.

A chemical reaction  can be represented symbolically in a chemical equation, with formulas of reactants on the left and formulas of products on the right; reactants and products are sepa- rated by an arrow. The equation must be balanced. A bal- anced equation reflects the true quantitative relationships between reactants and products. An equation is balanced by placing stoichiometric coefficients before formulas to signify that the total number of each kind of atom is the same on each side of the equation. The physical states of  reactants and products can be indicated by symbols, such as (s), (l), (g), and (aq), signifying solid, liquid, gas, and aqueous solution, respectively. "

For example, some reactions yield exactly the quantity of product calculated—the theoreti- cal yield. When the actual yield equals the theoretical yield, the percent yield is $100\\%$ . In some reactions, the actual yield is less than the theoretical, in which case the   percent yield is less than $100\\%$ . Lower yields may result from the formation of by-products, substances that replace some of the desired product because of reactions other than the one of interest, called side reactions. Some stoi- chiometric calculations are complicated by the fact that two or more simultaneous reactions may occur. In other  cases, a final product may be formed through a sequence of consecutive reactions. An intermediate is any sub- stance that is a product of one reaction and a reactant in a subsequent reaction. The equations for a series of consecu- tive reactions are often replaced with a single overall equation for the overall reaction. "

        "text": "As a chemical analyst you are presented with two samples of sodium bicarbonate—one from the  manufacturing process and the other derived from trona. You are asked to determine which is purer and are told that the impurity is sodium carbonate. You decide to treat the samples with just sufficient  hydrochloric acid to convert all the sodium carbon- ate and bicarbonate to sodium chloride, carbon dioxide, and water. You then precipitate silver chlo- ride in the reaction of sodium chloride with silver  nitrate. A $6.93\\:\\mathrm{g}$ sample of baking soda derived from trona gave $11.89\\;\\mathrm{g}$ of silver chloride. A $6.78\\;\\mathrm{g}$ sample from manufactured sodium carbonate gave $11.77~\\mathrm{g}$  of silver chloride. Which sample is purer, that is, which has the greater mass percent $\\mathrm{{\\bar{Na}H C O_{3}}^{\\prime}}$ "
