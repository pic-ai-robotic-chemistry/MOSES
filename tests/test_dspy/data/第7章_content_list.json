To understand the relationship between heat and chemical and physical changes, we must start with some basic definitions. We will then explore the concept of heat and the methods used to measure the transfer of energy across boundaries. Another form of energy transfer is work, and, in combination with heat, we will define the first law of thermodynamics. At this point, we will establish the relationship between heats of reaction and changes in internal energy and enthalpy. We will see that the tabulation of the change in internal energy and change in  enthalpy can be used to calculate, directly or indirectly, energy changes during chemical and physical changes. Finally, concepts introduced in this chapter will answer a host of practical questions, such as why natural gas is a better fuel than coal and why the energy value of fats is greater than that of carbohy- drates and proteins.

The number of molecules in $1\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of water is much greater than the number of atoms in, for exam- ple, ${1}\\mathrm{\\,g}$ of lead. Thus, when the same quantity of heat is added to $_{\\textrm{1g}}$ ofwater andto ${1}\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of lead, the added energy is spread over a larger number of entities in the water than in the lead. Thus, the average energy of water molecules increases by a smaller amount than that of lead atoms. The smaller increase in average energy manifests itself as a smaller increase in temperature because, as We established in Chapter 6, temperature is a measure of the average (transla- tional) energy of the particles in the system. Lead and mercury have low specific heat capacities because their molar masses are quite large. One-gram samples of  these substances have far fewer atoms to absorb added energy. "

When exactly half  the sand has been removed, the gas will have reached state 2. This very slow  expansion proceeds in a nearly reversible fashion. From a thermodynamic per- spective, a process is reversibie if the changes produced in the system and the surroundings (and therefore, the universe) can be completely undone by reversing the steps. A reversible process involves an infinite number of inter- mediate states, with the system variables changing from their initial values to their final values by infinitesimally small amounts. The process illustrated in Figure 7-12 is not quite reversible because grains of sand have more than an infinitesimal mass. In this approximately reversible process we have made a very large number of intermediate expansions. This process provides more Work than when the gas expands directly from state 1 to state 2. "

There is currently a debate about whether oil production has peaked now and is about to decline, or whether it will peak more toward the middle of the this century. The second problem with fossil fuels is their environmental effect.  Sulfur impurities in fuels produce oxides of sulfur. The high temperatures asso- ciated with combustion cause the reaction of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in air to form oxides of nitrogen. Oxides of sulfur and nitrogen are implicated in air pollution and are important contributors to the environmental problem known as acid rain. Another inevitable product of the combustion of fossil fuels is carbon dioxide, One of the \"greenhouse\" gases leading to global warming and potential changes in Earth's climate. "

An isolated system can exchange neither energy nor matter with its surroundings (Fig. 7-1). Energy is the capacity to do work, and work is performed when a force acts through a distance. Energy can be further characterized (Fig. 7-2) as kinetic energy (energy associated with matter in motion) or potential energy\n\n (energy resulting from the position or composition of\n\n  matter).
