With improved methods of determining atomic masses and with the discovery of argon (group O, atomic mass 39.9), which was placed ahead of potassium (group I, atomic mass 39.1), it became clear that a few elements might always remain \"out of order.\" At the time, these out-of-order placements were justified by chemical evidence. Elements were placed in the groups that their chemical behavior  dictated. There was no theoretical explanation for this reordering. Matters changed in 1913 as a result of some research by Henry G. J. Moseley on the X-ray spectra of the elements. "

The anode is called the target. X-ray emission can be explained in the following way. If the bombarding electrons have sufficient energy, they can eject electrons from the inner orbitals of target metal atoms. Electrons from higher orbitals then drop  down to fill the vacancies, emitting X-ray photons with energies correspond- ing to the difference in energy between the originating level and the vacancy level. Moseley reasoned that because the energy required to eject an electron depends on the nuclear charge, the frequencies of emitted X-rays should depend on the nuclear charges of atoms in the target. Using techniques newly developed by the father-son team of W. Henry Bragg and W. Lawrence Bragg, Moseley obtained photographic images of $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{X}}$ rayspectra and assigned frequencies to the spectral lines. His spectra for the elements  from Ca to $Z\\mathrm{n}$ are reproduced in Figure 9-2(b). "

In Figure 9-4, it is apparent that the atomic radii of transition elements tend to be about the same across a period but with a few unusual peaks. It is beyond the scope of this text to explain the exceptions; however, the general trend is not difficult to understand. In a series of transition ele- ments, additional electrons go into an inner electron shell, where they participate in shielding outer-shell electrons from the nucleus. At the same time, the number of electrons in the outer shell tends to remain con- stant. Thus, the outer-shell electrons experience a roughly comparable force of attraction to the nucleus throughout a transition series. Consider Fe, Co, and Ni. Fe has 26 protons in the nucleus and 24 inner-shell elec- trons. In Co( $\\cdot Z=27$ ), there are 25 inner-shell electrons, and in Ni $Z=28]$ ), there are 26. In each case, the two outer-shell electrons are under the influence of about the same net charge (about $+2$ ). That is, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for the $4s$ electrons of the first transition series is approximately constant. Thus, atomic radii do not change very much for this series of three elements) namely, $124\\,\\mathrm{pm}$ for Fe and $125\\,\\mathrm{pm}$ for Co and Ni. "

It is difficult to answer this ques- tion with complete certainty, but it is clear that the dip occurs once orbital sharing begins. The difficulty of providing an unambiguous explanation for the observed dip is not totally unexpected. As we pointed out in Chapter 8, the energy of an atom is a delicate balance of electron-electron repulsions and electron-nucleus attractions. The rationalization of ioniza- tion energies is further complicated by the fact that, for example, the first ionization energy of $\\mathrm{P}$ depends on the energies of both $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{[Ne]}3s^{2}3p^{3})$ and $\\mathrm{P}^{+}([\\mathrm{Ne}]3s^{2}3p^{2})$ .

        "text": "In 1930, John C. Slater devised the following set of  designated electron in the orbital ns or $n p$ (i)  Write the electron configuration of the element, and group the subshells as follows: (1s), $(2s,2p)$ $(3s,{\\bar{3}}p)$$(\\bar{3}d)$$(4s,4p)$$(4d)$，$(4f)$$(5s,5p)$,etc.(ii）  Electrons in groups to the right of the $(n s,n p)$ group contribute nothing to the shielding con- stant for the designated electron. (ii)  All the other electrons in the $(n s,n p)$  group shield the designated electron to the extent of 0.35 each. (iv) All electrons in the $n\\mathrm{~-~}1$  shell shield to the extent of 0.85 each. (v)  All electrons in the $n\\mathrm{~-~}2$ shell, or lower, shield  completely—their contributions to the shielding constant are 1.00 each. When the designated electron being shielded is in an nd or nf group, rules (ii) and (ii) remain the same but rules (iv) and (v) are replaced by (vi)  Each electron in a group lying to the left of the nd  or nf group contributes 1.00 to the shielding constant. These rules are a simplified generalization based on the average behavior of different types of electrons. Use these rules to do the following: (a) Calculate $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for a valence electron of oxygen. (b) Calculate $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for the 4s electron in Cu. (c)Calculate $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for a $3d$ electron in Cu. (d) Evaluate the $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for the valence electrons in the  group 1 elements (including H), and show that the ionization energies observed for this group are accounted for by using the Slater rules. [Hint: Do not  overlook the effect of $n$  on the orbital energy.] (e)Evaluate $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for a valence electron in the elements Li through Ne, and use the results to explain the  observed trend in first ionization energies for these elements. (f) Using the radial functions given in Table 8.2 and $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ estimated with the Slater rules, compare plots of the radial probability for the 3s, $3p,$ and $3d$  orbitals for the H atom and the Na atom. What do you observe from these plots regarding the effect of shielding on radial probability distributions? "
