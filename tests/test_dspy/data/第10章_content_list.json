Some of these meth- ods are described and compared in Exercise 128. One widely used electronega- tivity scale, with values given in Figure 10-6, is that devised by Linus Pauling (1901-1994). Pauling's EN values range from about 0.7 to 4.0. In general, the lower its EN, the more metallic the element is, and the higher the EN, the more nonmetallic it is. From Figure 10-6 we also see that electronegativity decreases from top to bottom in a group and increases from left to right in a period of the periodic table. These are the expected trends when we interpret electronegativity  in terms of the quantity $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\mathrm{~-~}\\bar{E}_{\\mathrm{ea}}\\right)$ . That is, as the ionization energy $(E_{\\mathrm{i}})$ increases across the period we expect the electronegativity to increase. The distinction between electron affinity and electronegativity is clearly seen when we consider the electron affinities of fluorine $(-328\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1})$  and chlorine $(-349\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1})$ ：  Although the electron affinity of $\\dot{C}\\mathrm{l}\\,(-349\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1})$ is somewhat more negative than that of F $(-328\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1})$ , the $\\mathrm{EN}$ of Cl (3.0) is significantly lower than that  of F (4.0) because of the decreased ionization energy of $\\mathrm{Cl}\\;(1251\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\;mol}^{-1})$  rela- tive to F $(1681\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}})$ 0 "

A Lewis struc- ture is a combination of Lewis symbols used to represent chemical bonding. Normally, all the electrons in a Lewis  structure are paired, and each atom in the structure acquires an octet—that is, there are eight electrons in the  valence shell. In Lewis theory, chemical bonds are classi- fied as ionic bonds, which are formed by electron transfer between atoms, or covalent bonds, which are formed by  electrons shared between atoms. Most bonds, however, have partial ionic and partial covalent characteristics. "

In covalent bonds, pairs of electrons shared between two atoms to form the bonds are called bond pairs, whereas  pairs of electrons not shared in a chemical bond are called lone pairs. A single pair of electrons shared between two atoms constitutes a single covalent bond. When both elec- trons in a covalent bond between two atoms are provided by only one of the atoms, the bond is called a coordinate covalent bond. To construct a Lewis structure for a mole-  cule in which all atoms obey the octet rule, it is often nec- essary for atoms to share more than one pair of electrons,  thus forming multiple covalent bonds. Two shared elec- tron pairs constitute a double covalent bond and three shared pairs a triple covalent bond. "

Whether a bond is polar or not can be\n\n  predicted by comparing the electronegativity (EN) of the atoms involved (Fig. 10-6). The greater the electronegativity difference (△EN) between two atoms in a chemical bond,\n\n  the more polar the bond and the more ionic its character.\n\n  The electron charge distribution in a molecule can be visual- ized by computing an electrostatic potential map (Figs. 10-4  and 10-5). The variation of charge in the molecule is repre- sented by a color spectrum in which red is the most negative  and blue the most positive. Electrostatic potential maps are a powerful way of representing electron charge distribution in both polar and nonpolar molecules. "

Atoms that are bonded to just one other atom are called terminal atoms (structure 10.13). Typically, the atom with the lowest electronegativity is a central atom. At times, the concept of formal charge (expression 10.16) is useful in selecting a skeletal structure and assessing the plausibility of a Lewis structure. "

(2) A few molecules have incomplete octets in their Lewis structures, that is, not enough electrons to provide an octet for every atom.

In these, the valence shell of the central atom must be expanded to 10 or  12 electrons in order to write a Lewis structure. "

The angles between the electron groups provide a method for predicting bond angles in a molecule. An important use of information about the shapes  of molecules is in establishing whether bonds in a molecule combine to produce a resultant dipole moment (Fig. 10-15).  Molecules with a resultant dipole moment are polar mole- cules; those with no resultant dipole moment are nonpolar. "
