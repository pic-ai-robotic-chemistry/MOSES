In fact, so little $\\mathrm{degCl}$ dissolves in water that this compound is generally considered to be insoluble. Precipitation reactions occur when certain cations and anions combine to produce an insoluble ionic solid called a precipitate. One laboratory use of precipitation reactions is in identifying the ions present in a solution, as shown in Figure 5-7. In industry, precipitation reactions are used to manufacture numerous chemicals. In the extraction of magnesium metal from seawater, for instance, the first step is to precipitate $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ as $\\mathrm{Mg}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\\mathrm{s})$ . In this section, the objective is to represent precipitation reactions by chemical equations and to apply some simple rules for predicting precipitation reactions. "

In a redox reaction, we have additional considerations. When bai- ancing a redox reaction, we make use of a formalism in which we imagine electrons are transferred from one substance to another. Using this formalism, we must keep track of electrons and the charge that these electrons carry. Therefore, in balancing the chemical equation for a redox reaction, we focus  equally on three factors: (1) the number of atoms of each type, (2) the number of electrons transferred, and (3) the total charges on reactants and products. We should point out, however, that if we balance the equation with respect to  the number of atoms and the number of electrons transferred, then the equa- tion is automatically balanced with respect to the total charges.

In basic solution, $\\mathrm{OH}^{-},$ not $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ , must appear in the final balanced equation. (Recall that, in basic solutions, $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ ions are present in excess.) Because both $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ con- tain $\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{o}$ atoms, at times it is hard to decide on which side of the half- equations to put each one. One simple approach is to treat the reaction as though it were occurring in an acidic solution, and balance it as in Example 5-6. Then, add to each side of the overall redox equation a number of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ ions equal to the number of $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ ions.

Ionic compounds produce ions by dissociation whereas molecular compounds produce ions via ioniza- tion. Weak electrolytes ionize to a limited extent, and strong electrolytes dissociate or ionize almost completely into ions. In addition to the molarity based on the solute as a whole, a solution's concentration can be stated in terms  of the molarities of the individual solute species present molecules and ions. "

Similarly, a base produces\n\n $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ ions in aqueous solution and is either a strong base (Table 5.2) or a weak base, depending on the extent of the ionization. According to the Bronsted-Lowry theory, in an acid-base reaction, protons are transferred from the acid (the proton donor) to the base (the proton  acceptor). In an acid-base neutralization reaction, an acid and a base react to form an ionic compound, a salt. Water might also be a product. Some reactions in which gases are evolved can also be treated as acid-base reactions (Table 5.3). "
