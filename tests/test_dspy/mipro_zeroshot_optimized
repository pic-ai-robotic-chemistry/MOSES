Extract Chemistry-Related Entities:\n  - Identify all significant nouns, proper nouns, and technical terminologies that represent chemistry-related concepts, such as molecules, reactions, compounds, processes, or any substantial entities.\n  - Ensure that you capture entities across different levels of detail, from broad chemical categories to specific molecular structures, to create a comprehensive representation of the subject matter.\n  - Choose names for entities that are specific enough to indicate their meaning without additional context, avoiding overly generic terms.\n  - Consolidate similar entities to avoid redundancy, ensuring each represents a distinct concept at appropriate granularity levels.\n\n2. Identify Data Properties:\n  - Extract attributes or characteristics of the identified entities that can be classified as data properties, ensuring they are value-based and not entities themselves.\n  - Clearly define each data property, ensuring it accurately describes an attribute of an entity.\n\n3. Establish Object Properties:\n  - Carefully examine the text to identify all relationships between entities, ensuring each relationship is correctly captured with accurate details about the interactions.\n  - Analyze the context and interactions between the identified entities to determine how they are interconnected, focusing on actions, associations, dependencies, or similarities.\n  - Clearly define the relationships, ensuring accurate directionality that reflects the logical or functional dependencies among entities.\n\nObjective: Produce a detailed and comprehensive ontology that captures the full spectrum of chemistry-related entities, data properties, and object properties mentioned in the text, along with their interrelations, reflecting both broad concepts and intricate details specific to the chemistry domain.",
