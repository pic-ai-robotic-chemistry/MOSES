We report the first example of a synthetic receptor able to recognize mono-methylated lysines in a histone H3 tail peptide, which has relevant function in epigenetic regulation. Recognition is robust and specific regardless the position and the number of the mono-methylated lysines along the polypeptide chain. The peptide is first captured in solution by a tetraphosphonate cavitand ( Tiiii )  that  selectively  bind  its  Lys-NMe   moieties. Separation from + solution and detection of the peptideTiiii complexes is then enabled in one single step by an all dielectric SiO2-TiO2 coreshell resonators (T-rex), which captures the complex and operates fully reproducible signal transduction by non-plasmonic surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) without degrading the complex. The realized abiotic probe is able to distinguish multiple mono-methylated peptides from the single mono-methylated ones.",

        "content": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as histone lysine methylation, are a fundamental part of the histone code, which have  a  large  influence  on  gene  expression. 1-5   Histones  have cationic  amino-terminal  tails  (-NH3 + )  that  are  subjected  to several PTMs, such as the mono-methylation of the ε-amine of lysines. Sequencing studies have shown that several lysines of the histone H3 tail peptide (e.g. H3K4, H3K9, H3K20 and H3K27) are  often  the  preferred  methylation  sites,  although  speciesspecific differences do exist. 6 Even though epigenetic alterations have  sparked  great  interest,  for  example  into deciphering  the  regulatory  pathways  and  function  of  histone PTMs in cancer and type 2 diabetes, 7,8  the mono-methylation of lysine is unfortunately a very challenging moiety to identify and measure.  Indeed,  the  relatively  low  molecular  weight  of  the methyl residue and the lack of a significant charge difference between monomethylated and non-methylated lysine de facto exclude detection via direct physicochemical methods.

See DOI: 10.1039/x0xx00000x methylation with little or no  dependence on the local amino acid sequence has been proven very difficult. 1  This unmet need has severely hampered the study of the histone, and protein in general, methylome and its medical translation.\nDrawing inspiration from Nature, 9,10  chemists have started to explore  the  possibility  to  use  synthetic  receptors  for  the recognition  of  histone  methylation. 11-14   So  far,  most  of  the attention  was  given  to  the  complexation  of  side  chain  dimethylated 15  and trimethylated 16-18  lysine (Nε), while synthetic receptors  that  bind  selectively  monomethylated  forms  (LysNMe + ) of the side chains of lysine residues are unprecedented. Tetraphosphonate cavitands ( Tiiii from now onward) 19,20 (Scheme  1)  have  an  edge  in  this  respect,  being  the  only synthetic  receptors  known  to  bind  monomethylated  amino acids with  high selectivity both  in water  and  in  organic solvents. 21  The pivotal role played by cation-π interactions 22  of the  acidic + NH2-CH3  group  with  the  π-basic  cavity  strongly coupled to the steric demand for inclusion favors monomethylated  ammonium  ions  versus  pristine,  di-  and trimethylated ammonium ions. 23\nPost-translational modifications in proteins are mainly detected using indicator displacement assays. 11,24,25 Recently, this methodology has been proposed for the detection of trimethylated lysine in the H3 histone tail using a deep cavitand as recognition element. 26  In view of separation and biosensing applications, solid phase supported methods able for capturing, transduction and amplification with high fidelity and reproducibility  are  needed.  In  this  regard,  surface  Raman spectroscopy represents a powerful resource. Metal nanoparticle (NP) substrates with a plasmonic resonance in the UV-Vis-NIR ( e.g. Al, Ag, Au, Cu) are typically utilized to enhance the Raman response of most of the analytes characterized by a very low-cross section, taking advantage of the plasmon-driven",

However, SERS detection is often affected by huge increase of the local electromagnetic  field (the so-called instability of the Raman signals and low reproducibility, due to the heavy perturbation of the system under analysis caused by the  excited  plasmonic  NPs,  which  generate  local  heating  and catalyze unwanted photo-reactions. For this reason, the weak interactions that hold a mono-methylated lysineTiiii complex would hardly survive plasmonic SERS and be quickly degraded. We  recently  circumvented  this  drawback  by  coupling Tiiii receptors to all-dielectric resonators made of SiO2/TiO2 core/shell (T-rex) colloids. 27 The T-rex beads exploit the synergistic combination of the evanescent fields resulting from total internal reflection and multiple scattering of light at the bead-to-bead interface for  amplifying the optical path length and  extracting  more  Raman  photons,  without  altering  the stability of the analytes. 28-31\nIn  this  work  we  contemporarily  assess  the  ability  of Tiiii as specific  binder  for  monomethylated  histone  H3  tail  peptides and proof that all-dielectric enhanced Raman spectroscopy by T-rex is the suitable mean  for enabling separation and transduction of the peptideTiiii complexes.",
