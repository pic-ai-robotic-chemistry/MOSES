Doltsinis [b] and Bart Jan Ravoo* [a]\nAbstract: Arylazopyrazoles (AAPs) represent a new class of photochromic  azo  compounds  offering  high  yield E Z / -isomerization in both directions by irradiation with UV or green light, respectively. Additionally,  AAPs  show  a  light-responsive  host-guest  interaction with β -cyclodextrin (CD) with comparable  binding affinities as reported  for azobenzenes.  Substitution  of  one  benzene  of  the azobenzene by a dimethylpyrazole leads to a separation of the n-π* and π-π* absorbances  of  the  molecules  enabling  the  optimized photochromic  behavior.  Since  it  is  expected  that  AAPs  show  a strong dependence of the photophysical properties on the substitution  pattern  of  the  photochromic  core,  we  herein  report  a comprehensive study on the effect of various substituents of water soluble  AAPs.  Therefore,  substituents  with  different  electronic  and steric effects were introduced on different positions of AAP. The E Z / -isomerization, the half-life time of the Z-isomer, the quantum yields as well as the stability against glutathione (GSH) were investigated. Additionally,  DFT  calculations  were  conducted  and  the  host-guest chemistry with β -cyclodextrin was investigated.",

Especially, light-responsive molecules -  photoswitches  -  are  of  particular  interest. [1] Controlling  the function of complex systems by light is attractive, since light is non-invasive for the system and can be applied with high spatial and temporal control. [2-4] Several photoswitches, such as azobenzenes [5-7] ,  diarylethenes [8,9] and  spiropyranes [10-12] have been widely investigated and optimized by different substitution patterns to fulfill the desired criteria. Among all these photoswitches,  azobenzene  is  the  most  commonly  used, [13,14] since it offers in addition to the reversible photoisomerization, a light-responsive  host-guest  interaction  with  cyclodextrins. [15,16] The  light-responsive  azobenzene/cyclodextrin  interaction  was first reported by UENO et al. and since then extensive research was done on the construction of light-responsive supramolecular systems using this phenomenon.

        "content": "in photoswitchable materials, azobenzenes have been modified in various  ways  to  tailor  them  for  specific  applications.  To circumvent  the  use  of  UV-light  for  the E-Z isomerization,  the groups of HECHT and WOOLLEY reported tetraortho substituted azobenzenes, for which both isomerizations could be triggered by visible or even near IR light. [18-22] These compounds are now examples for optimized light-responsive moieties for the use in biological  systems. [23] Furthermore,  other  groups  reported  redshifted azobenzenes and a bridged azobenzene with improved photoisomerization  quantum  yields. [24-28] With  regard  to the ortho -methoxy substituted azobenzene of WOOLLEY, SI WU and coworkers  were  able  to  show  that  this  compound  can  still interact with β -cyclodextrin similarly to the unsubstituted azobenzene.  While  the  rod-like E -isomer  forms  a  stable  1:1 host-guest  complex  with β -CD,  the  twisted  and  more  polar Z -isomer  is  not  showing  any  interaction.  By  using  this  property, several  red-light  responsive  supramolecular  systems  such  as hydrogels were reported. [29,30] HECHT and coworkers reported in additional studies of the ortho -fluorinated azobenzenes that the substitution  pattern  of  these  compounds  can  highly  affect  their properties. [31] Similar effects have been reported for azobenzenes  in  many  examples.  For  instance,  the  so  called 'push-pull azobenzenes' with electron donating as well electron withdrawing  substituents  show  a  reversal  of  the  absorbance bands in the UV/vis spectrum. [6]\nThe  optimization  of  the  azobenzene  photoswitch  also  inspired the investigation of azoheteroarenes. In general, in these compounds, one benzene ring of the azobenzene is substituted by  a  heterocycle  changing  the  electronic  as  well  as  the  steric properties of the molecules. [32,33] A  first  promising example was reported by the group of HERGES. They showed that azoindazoles  present  a  complete E Z -isomerization,  whereas the Z E -isomerization with only 55% is still insufficient. [34]",

        "content": "The photostationary state (PSS) of AAPs  and other azo compounds in general is determined primarily by the possibility of  selective  excitation  of  one  isomer.  The  difference  in  the absorbance  maxima  stated  in  Table  1  clearly  shows  that  the substitution affects the peak splitting and therefore gives a first hint  on  the  PSS.  Moreover,  the  key  feature  of  the  excellent switching  of  AAPs  is  the  forced  twisted  conformation  of  the Z -isomer  by  the  methyl  groups  at  the  pyrazole  breaking  the symmetry and increasing the  intensity  of  the n-π* -absorbance. By this, this band absorbs at wavelengths >500 nm where the E -isomer does not absorb, thus allowing exclusive n-π* -excitation. In  addition  to  the  absorbance  maxima  discussed  above,  the extinction coefficients at the irradiation wavelength were determined (Table 2). In this way, a more meaningful assumption  on  the  exclusive  excitation  of  on  isomer  over  the other might be drawn for every AAP. The collected data clearly shows that in all cases higher extinction of E -isomers at 365 nm is  observed, which enables the E Z --isomerization by irradiation with  UV-light  of  this  wavelength.  For  most  AAPs  ε  of  the Z -Isomer is at this wavelength approximately 10 times smaller. In contrast to this a lower difference is observed for AAPs 8 , 10 , 15 and 18 ,  which  can  cause  lower  PSS E Z -for  these  compounds. With regard to ε at 520 nm E -isomers of AAPs 1 , 2 , 6 , 9 and 12 show  no  absorbance  at  all,  which  should  enable  exclusive excitation of the Z -isomer and high PSS Z E -.  In  addition for most AAPs a significant larger extinction coefficient is found for the Z -isomers, whereas ε for the E -isomers are in general rather low. In  this  case  again  the  results  found  for  the ortho -substituted compounds 4 , 7 and 8 show a discrepancy from the other AAPs. For these compounds comparable extinction coefficients for both isomers at 520 nm were determined. This is in agreement with the previous findings of the spectroscopic data shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 further supporting the assumption of low PSS Z E -for these AAPs due to fully overlapping absorbances. This phenomenon limits the photoisomerization in unmodified azobenzenes.  In  addition,  the",

The  collected  values  in  this case vary over a broad range and no obvious trends could be found.  However the measurements show that for all cases the photoisomerization is complete in a time scale of a few minutes. To finally quantify the photoisomerization, the PSS  were determined  by 1 H-NMR  spectroscopy.  A  first  spectrum  was recorded before irradiation with 365 nm light to yield PSSE-Z and recording a second spectrum. After irradiation with 520 nm light a third spectrum of the PSSZ-E was recorded. Figure 2 shows a zoom-in of the aromatic region for the measurements made for AAP-12 as an example. The full spectra for AAP-12 , as well as full  spectra  and  zoom-ins in the areas used for integration can be found in the supporting information (Figures S36-S70). The determined  PSS  are  listed  in  Table  3.  For  some  AAPs  with strong hydrophobic character a broadening of the signals in the E -isomer can be observed due to aggregation of the AAP core in aqueous solution, but nevertheless the PSS could be determined reliably.",

The  explanation  for  the  incomplete photoswitching  of  these  compounds  can  be  found  by  a  close inspection of the UV/Vis spectra and the calculated structures of these compounds. The absorbances for in the UV/Vis spectra of AAP-7 and AAP-8 show  a  near  complete  overlap  limiting selective  excitation  (Figures  S6  and  S7  and  Table  2).  The overlap is  due  to  the  geometric  structure  of these  compounds. By  the  additional  methyl  groups  in  the ortho -positions  of  the benzene ring the E -isomer tends to twist due to steric hindrance. The slightly distorted structure breaks the symmetry in the N=N double bond increasing the intensity of the n-π *-absorbance. For AAP-18 in  similar  fashion  a  low  difference  in  the  extinction coefficients at 365 nm was observed explaining the findings from the PSS measurements.\nAnother  interesting  aspect  is  that  in  contrast  to  all  the  other AAPs, 7 and 8 exhibit a considerable amount of the thermodynamically unstable Z -isomer directly after sample preparation (~30%). A possible explanation might be stabilizing London  dispersion  interactions  of  the  substituents  in  the Z -isomer.  This  hypothesis  is  corroborated  by  our  theoretically determined relative energies (see Table 4 below). SCHWEIGHAUSER et  al . reported  that  bulky  alkyl  substituents affect  the  stability  of  the Z -isomer by steric  hindrance,  but  that\nadditionally  stabilizing  dispersion  interactions  play  an  important role  and can stabilize the Z -isomer.

Depending on desired application  longer  or  shorter  half-life  times  are  preferred.  For example for storage of optical data - a research field currently dominated by diarylethenes - a long half-life time is preferred. [2,9] Therefore, we investigated the thermal stability of AAPs 1-19 by time dependent UV/Vis spectroscopy. The results are summarized in Figure 3 and the measurements can be found in the supporting information (Figure S71-S79).\nFigure 3. Half-life times of AAPs 1-18 in dd H2O at 25°C (70°C for AAP-7 and AAP-8 ).\nFigure 3 and the result found before for AAP-19 show that the half-life time of Z -AAPs can vary between a few seconds ( AAP19 ), a few hours ( AAP-14 and AAP-17 ), to days or even multiple month and  years  ( AAP-7 and AAP-8 ).  As  expected  the ortho -substituted  AAPs 4 , 7 and 8 show  the  longest  half-life  time, which might be explained by enhanced dispersion interactions. Whereas Τ 1/2 for AAP-4 was determined to be ~21 days at room temperature,  for AAP-7 and AAP-8 no  thermal  relaxation  was observed after 3 months. As a consequence the half-life time of these  compounds  was  determined  at  70°C  yielding Τ 1/2 of  ~2 days.  This  value  is  close  to  the  longest  reported  value  of azobenzenes, which was reported by HECHT and coworkers for ortho -fluorinated azobenzenes (95 h at 60°C = ~700 days at rt) and unsubstituted AAPs (1000 days at rt).

It appears from our data that para - and ortho -substitution affect the half-life time more strongly in comparison to meta -substitution ( AAP-3 and AAP-6 ). Substitution  with  electron  withdrawing  groups  (EWGs)  at  the para -position leads to an increased life-time for a weak withdrawing  effect  ( AAP-15 ,  OCF3),  but  if  the  EWG  effect  is increased a drastic decrease of life time is observed correlating with the HAMMETT coefficient of the substituents AAP-19 < AAP17 < AAP-16 < AAP-15 (NO2  ( σ = 0.78), CN  ( σ = 0.66), CF3 ( σ = 0.54), OCF3 ( σ = 0.35). For electron donating (EDG) substituents,  a  higher  thermal stability is  observed,  the  highest for AAP-12 (OMe).  Comparison  of AAP-5 and AAP-1 again shows  that  London  dispersion  effects  may  contribute  to  the stabilization of the Z -isomer, since they increase from methyl to ethyl substituents. Additionally, increasing the para -substituents from methyl to tert -butyl (increased inductive effect) leads to an increased half-life time (with isopropyl as exception). To summarize, the half-life time of AAPs can be manipulated over a wide time scale by introducing specific substituents at selected positions.",

AAPs 4 7 , and 8 show the lowest  energies  for  the Z -isomer,  resulting  in  a  higher  thermal stability of the metastable Z -isomer.\nAnother correlation can be found for the thermal stability of the EWG substituted  AAPs.

[46] Additionally, the binding  affinity is drastically decreased by isomerization upon irradiation with UV-light (365 nm). The binding constant of Z -AAP-1 determined by ITC drops down to about 700 M -1 , which is again in good agreement with  the  reported  value  of Z -azobenzene  (~500  M -1 ). [47] The reduced  affinity  of Zvs. Eisomers  will  be  amplified  in  highly multivalent systems such as particle assemblies or polymers. [39] The  slightly  higher  binding  affinity  of Z -AAP  in  contrast  to Z -azobenzenes might be attributed to the more twisted conformation of AAPs compared to azobenzenes (dihedral angle (CNNC) = 4.2° vs 12.2°, Table S2). [48-50] As a result the benzene ring  is  more  exposed  and  therefore  more  easily  accessible  for the β -CD.\nIn  general,  the  binding  affinities  of  guests  for β -CD are mainly driven by the hydrophobic effect and dominated by two parameters.

Secondly,  high  energy  water  has  to  leave  the  cavity  and  the solvation  shell  of  the  guest  and  enter  the  bulk  water,  yielding additional  hydrogen  bonding.

        "content": "Focusing  on  the  alkyl-substituted  AAPs,  there  is  a  clear  trend that  a para -substitution  is  highly  favored  over  substitution  in ortho -or meta -positions. Whereas the ortho -and meta -substituted AAPs  ( 3 , 4 , and 6-8 ) show  negligible binding affinities, para -substitution leads to a clear trend with increasing binding  constants  from  H < OMe < Me < O Pr <  Pr <  Bu ( i i t AAP1 < AAP-12 < AAP-2 < AAP-13 < AAP-9 < AAP-10 ).  The  same trend was  already observed for substituted benzoic acids yielding  similar  binding  affinities. [53] In  this  way,  the  binding constant of E -AAPs could be tuned within a range of 1000 M -1 and 40000 M -1 . The higher affinity of para -substituted AAPs over the substitution at other positions can be explained by the more rod-like structure of para -substituted AAPs resulting in a better fit of the guests inside the cavity. The slightly higher binding affinity of AAP-5 might  be  explained  by  secondary  interactions  of  the ethyl groups  with the outer rim of the cyclodextrin, since previous studies showed that the pyrazole unit is not participating in the host-guest complexation. [36] Interestingly, the naphthalene AAP ( AAP-11 ) did not show a host-guest complexation with β -CD which was in contrast to our expectations.  Nevertheless, AAP-11 might  be  an  interesting candidate for cyclodextrins with larger cavities such as γ -CD. On the  other  hand,  the  spectacularly  high  binding  constants  of AAP-9 (~30000  M -1 ) and AAP-10 (~40000  M -1 ) drew  our attention, possessing  the  highest  affinities  reported  for  azo compounds  so  far.  However,  measurements  of  the Z -isomers still show, in both cases, a significant binding constant to β -CD, meaning a loss of the light-responsive characteristic of the hostguest interaction. Probably the isopropylphenyl and tert -butylphenyl  residues  are  still  accessible  for  the β -CD in  the Z -isomer leading to the formation of an inclusion complex. Other than these two, the rest of the AAPs show a low binding affinity for  the Z -isomer  compared  to",

        "content": "Despite the need of UV-light for the E-Z -isomerization of AAPs, they might have potential applications in biological applications and first examples of AAPs in DNA based systems have already been reported. [38,41] For the use of azo based photoswitches in in vivo applications, their stability in the reducing cellular environment, containing compounds such as glutathione (GSH), is crucial. It is known  that  some  azo  compounds  undergo photobleaching  by  the  reduction  of  the  N=N  bond  by  GSH depending  on  their structure and  redox  potential. [54,55] The reduction  of  diazenylcarboxylic  acids  by  GSH  was  investigated by  KOSOWER et  al. , who  show  that  reduction  occurs  via  a nucleophilic  attack  of  the  thiol at one  nitrogen  following  a protonation of the second nitrogen. [56] WOOLLEY and coworkers assumed that the reduction of the tetra ortho -methoxy azobenzene  involves  an  initial  protonation  of  one  nitrogen, facilitating  the  attack  of  the  thiol.  The  intermediate  is  stabilized by  hydrogen  bonding  with  the ortho -methoxy  substituent. [19] In contrast  to  the ortho -methoxy  azobenzenes, ortho -chloro  or ortho -thiol substituted  derivatives  are  stable  in  concentrated GSH solution, due to the absence of hydrogen bonding.\nWe  investigated  the  stability  of  AAPs 1-19 in  a  concentrated GSH  solution  (10 mM,  highest  cellular  concentration  of  GSH). Therefore, solutions of all AAPs were incubated with GSH and in different intervals UV/Vis spectra were recorded. The measured spectra  can  be  found  in  the  supporting  information  (Figures S109- S115). As a result, we found almost no photobleaching of",

In comparison, the ortho -methoxy azobenzenes are reduced relatively fast at the same conditions ( τ 1/2 = 1 h). [19] In our case, only AAP-10 and 11 show a minimal change in the UV/Vis-spectra, whereas the remaining AAPs show no degradation  at  all.  An  explanation  for  the  stability  of E -AAPs might  be  the  higher  electron  density  of  the  N=N  bond  by  the electron  rich  pyrazole  hindering  the  nucleophilic  attack  of  the thiol. Prior protonation is not favored in this case, since there is no possibility for additional stabilization by hydrogen bonds. An additional  stabilizing  effect  might  be  steric  hindrance  by  the methyl  groups  of  the  pyrazole.  In  summary,  AAPs  possess excellent  stability  against  GSH  and  therefore  are  a  promising candidate for in vivo applications.\nFigure  7.

        "content": "In  this  paper,  we  report  how  the  substitution  pattern  of  the benzene ring determines the characteristics of the AAP photoswitch. AAPs 1-19 used in this study were synthesized in a facile three-step synthesis. All AAPs showed excellent photoisomerization,  which  is  crucial  for  the  switching  of  highly multivalent supramolecular systems. Exceptional cases are AAPs bearing ortho -substituents at the benzene ring. Additionally, it was possible to tune the thermal stability of AAPs over  a  broad  timescale  from  several  seconds  to  days,  months and  years.  By  increasing  the  rod-like  structure  of  AAPs  by introduction of non-polar substituents in para -position the binding affinity of AAPs to β -cyclodextrin could be increased to 40000 M -1 . However, a too high binding constant leads to a loss in the light-response of this interaction. Nevertheless, AAPs 2 , 5 , 12 and 13 are  examples  for  improved  AAPs  with  increased binding affinities for the E -isomers, without showing a significant interaction  in  the Z -isomer.  Last  but  not  least,  the  outstanding stability  against  glutathione  allows  their  potential  application in vivo . This is a clear advantage compared to most azobenzenes. All in all, this study documents the superior characteristics of the AAP based molecular switch. Since azoheteroarene photoswitches  have  not  been  investigated  in  great  detail  until now our findings should stimulate the further study, development and  application  of  azoheteroarene  photoswitches  in  different fields of science.",
