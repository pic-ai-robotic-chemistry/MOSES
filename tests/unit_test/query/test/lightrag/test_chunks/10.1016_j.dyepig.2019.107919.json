The classical water-soluble macrocyclic hosts included cyclodextrins [1] 、 calix[n]arenes  [2] 、 Pillar[n]arenes  [3] 、 Cucurbit[n]urils  [4]  and other macrocycles [5]. Due to the advantages of the binding interactions of high affinity [6] 、 high selectivity of binding [7] and low toxicity in vivo or vitro, cucurbit[n]urils as the common supramolecular macrocyclic molecules facilitate biologically relevant applications [8] and also contribute  to  nanotechnology  [9]  and  dynamic  self-assembly  system [10].  Water-soluble  fluorescent  dyes  as  molecular  containers  (nanocavities) have been found particularly useful to monitor the formation of discrete host-guest complexes with macrocyclic structures [11]. Pyrene is a typical water-soluble aromatic fluorescent dye and intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) fluorophore with an electron acceptor (A) and an electron donor (D) exhibit a broad and structure-less fluorescent emission [12]. To improve the emissive properties and ease charge transfer between the donor and acceptor parts in the excited state, several π π -conjugated  systems  including  benzene,  thiophene  and  furan  rings generally have been incorporated into pyrene dyes as  -linkers [13].

Because of the tendency to form the fluorescent π π -stacking, the fluorescence emission of this kind of fluorophores has remained low in aqueous solution. Therefore, the aggregation behavior of ICT compounds can be controlled by the movement of macrocyclic components [14]. To efficiently suppress aggregation, we establish a supramolecular approach to prevent PVP dyes from aggregating by forming a strong host-guest inclusion complex with the macrocyclic host; cucurbit[n]urils (n ¼ 7, 8). CB [7] can form 1:1 complexes with a range of PVP which efficiently suppress aggregation of PVP . In this case, the PVP dye encapsulation resulted in profound changes  in  the  emission  wavelength  and  quantum  yield,  as  well  as increased  photostability.  Compared  with  CB  [7],  CB  [8]  has  the increased volume of its cavity, the uniqueness of CB [8] as molecular receptor is expanded by the very nature of its hollow structure [15]. Based on the research of Scherman and Biedermann [16], CB [8] is a unique hydrophobic molecular receptor, its polar cavity can stabilize charge-transfer interactions between two guests of complementary nature, such as aromatic electron acceptors and donors [17].

Fig. 3 shows changes in 1 the optical properties upon complexation of PVP with CB [7] and CB [8].\nThe absorption intensity of CB [7]PVP in H2O undergoes a slight hypsochromic shift (from 606 to 568 nm) which provide the spectral signature for the deaggregation of the PVP chromophore upon addition\nThe fluorescence intensity of CB [7]PVP was significantly increased and  the  color  of  the  solution  changed  from  orange  to  bright  yellow (Scheme 1). When 1.0 equiv of CB [7] was added to the system, the fluorescence  intensity  of PVP in  600 nm  increased  by  about  800%. Moreover, the fluorescence emission spectra of it were blue shifted from 607 nm to 569 nm (Fig. 3c). In most cases, the fluorescence emission has remained low, likely on account of π π -stacking.  However, some derivatives can become highly fluorescent under the deaggregating conditions of high dilution [22]. Apparently, the pyrene units tend to form π π -stacking in the polar solution and the CB [8] efficiently suppress aggregation of PVP dyes in water.\nIn this context, our host-guest combination strategy offers a much more  straightforward  approach  to  protect  the PVP dye  from  selfaggregation  than  synthetic  modifications  of  the  molecule.  Different from the CB [7]PVP system, the absorption maximum of CB [8]PVP showed shorter red-shifts from 437 nm to 464 nm and the maximum absorption peak in 437 nm is reduced from 0.38 to 0.31 (Fig. 3b).
