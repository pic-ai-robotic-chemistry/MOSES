Lysophosphatidic  acid 1 (LPA), one kind of bioactive phospholipids, is an ideal biomarker for the early detection of ovarian and other gynecologic cancers. 2 The LPA concentrations in healthy human plasma are approximately 0.1 -6.3 µ M and the danger levels of LPA for gynecologic cancers are indicated by concentrations on the order of 63.2 μM. 3 The routine diagnostic  testing  of  plasma  LPA  level  is  limited  by  present detect techniques, such as tandem mass spectroscopy, capillary  electrophoresis  and  radio-enzymatic  assays,   which 4 need sophisticated devices and complicated procedures.

        "content": "LPA possesses two potential binding sites: one phosphate head  and  one  long-chain  fatty-acid  tail. Referring  to  the structural feature of LPA, we therefore designed the artificial receptor GC5A. First, calixarenes were employed  as the macrocyclic  scaffold,  which  have  been  described  as  having '(almost)  unlimited  possibilities'  benefiting  from  their  facial modification. 12 Second, among the calix[ n ]arene (C n A, n = 4, 5, 6, 8 generally) family, we screened C5A on account of size fit. The  alkyl  chain  threads  C5A  well,  but  not  the  smaller  C4A, whereas C6A and C8A are relatively larger and have complex conformations. 13 Third, guanidinium groups were decorated at the  upper  rim  of  C5A  to  donate  charge-assisted  hydrogen bonds (salt bridge) with the phosphate head of LPA. 14 Finally, alkyl chains were  attached  at  the lower  rim  to provide hydrophobic interaction with the tail of LPA besides rigidifying the C5A conformation. Collectively, these design principles led us  to  preparing  the  GC5A  host  shown  in  Scheme  1,  which  is expected  to  show  strong  binding  to  LPA  via  the  synergistic effect among  several interactions (electrostatic, hydrogen bond,  C -H ⋅⋅⋅π and  hydrophobic).  The  GC5A  was  prepared mainly according to the syntheses of reported C4A analogues (Scheme 2). 15 In brief, the synthesis started from the maternal p -tertbutylcalix[5]arene, which was alkylated at the lower rim to obtain 1 with well-defined cone conformation. 16 Subsequently, 2 was  generated  by treating 1 with  HNO3  and AcOH to substitute all the tert -butyl groups with nitro groups\nScheme 2.

Direct  NMR  and  calorimetric  titrations  were  therefore  ruled out since they generally need relatively high concentrations. As an alternative approach, fluorescent IDA that could be operated at low µ M or even nM concentrations appears to be a  desired  choice.

The  binding  stoichiometry  between  GC5A  and  Fl was determined as 1:1 according to the Job's plot (Figure S10). The association constant ( K a )  extracted from the fluorescence titration was fitted  as (5.0 ± 1.0) × 10 6 M -1 ,  which  was  further validated by the UV-Vis titration (Figure S11). More importantly, the fluorescence depression upon complexation, I free / I bound , is calculated as a factor of 37, which is ideal for the projected IDA application.\nThe  displacement  of  GC5A·Fl  by  gradual  addition  of  LPA resulted in regeneration of the intrinsic emission of Fl (Figure 1b).

To  validate  the  synergistic  effect of several interactions on the nanomolar binding between GC5A and LPA, we measured the binding of phosphate and 6:0 LPA (a shorter analogue)  with  GC5A,  giving  the K a values  of (4.6 ± 0.6) × 10  M 4 -1 and (4.8 ± 1.0) × 10  M 5 -1 (Figures S12 and S13) respectively.

        "content": "Moreover,  two  control  hosts  (GC4A  and  GC5A-CH3,  see Scheme S3 for their syntheses and structures) were prepared to  illustrate  the  significance  of  cavity  size  and  rigid  cone conformation. The C4A cavity is too small to thread any alkyl chain. 13a GC4A  affords  over  one  order  of  magnitude  weaker affinity ((1.3 ± 0.1) × 10  M 5 -1 )  to  Fl  than GC5A (Figure S14 and S15). By executing IDA, gradual addition of LPA does not lead to pronounced regeneration of the fluorescence in the beginning, indicating the weak complexation of GC4A with LPA (Figure  S16).  However,  in  the  presence  of  excess  LPA,  the fluorescence  regenerated.  We  postulated  it  is  not  the endo -complexation  but  the  co-assembly  between  cationic  (GC4A) and  anionic  (LPA)  surfactants. 18 The  formation  of  the  coassembly between GC4A and LPA was verified by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements (Figure S17). The scattering intensity increases gradually upon addition of excess LPA, which is in good accordance with the fluorescence result. It is worth  noting  that  no  appreciable  DLS  response  was detected for all the direct and competitive titrations of GC5A. Benefiting from the strong host-guest complexation, the titrations  were  performed  at  subµ M concentrations,  and  no co-assembly was formed. GC5A-CH3, the control C5A host with conformational  flexibility,  quenches  the  fluorescence  of  Fl  to much less extent,  and  gives  the  corresponding much  weaker affinity ((4.5 ± 0.3) × 10 4 M 1 ) -than GC5A (Figure S18). Therefore, both the cavity size and conformational rigidification  play  crucial  roles  in  the  molecular  recognition. The employment of C5A, as well as the well-tailored modification, are indispensable to realize the nanomolar binding of GC5A with LPA.",

        "content": "The complexation of LPA with GC5A was further verified by 1 H NMR experiments in D2O. We employed the shorter 6:0 LPA as  the  model  guest  for  NMR  measurements due  to the poor water-solubility of the longer LPA species. LPA protons underwent upfield shifts upon addition of GC5A (Figures 2a-c) due  to  the  ring  current  effect  of  the  aromatic  nuclei  of calixarenes. 13, 19 It should be mentioned that the complexation-induced  shifts  of  guest  protons  by  GC5A  are much less pronounced than those in the other calixarene cases (generally ∆δ = 1 -2 ppm). 11c, 13a It arises from  the  low molecular  electrostatic  potential  of  GC5A  ( vide  infra ) that leading  to  relatively  weak  ring  current  effect.  The  shifts  of H3 H5 signals are larger than the rest, indicating their location -in  the  center  of  cavity.  While  H1  and  H2  are  presumably located at the upper rim, H6 and H7 are close to the lower-rim oxygen  mean  plane  and  thread  out  of  the  cavity,  which  are away from the region of maximum shielding provided by the aromatic rings. Moreover, NMR measurements were performed at above CAC, so it is also possible that GC5A and LPA  form  co-assembly  but  not endo -complex.  If  GC5A  forms co-assembly  with  LPA  possibly,  GC4A  does  too.  We  further executed the NMR measurements of GC4A with LPA as control, observing  no  appreciable  complexation-induced  shift  (Figure S20).

To derive  further  insights  for  the  host-guest  binding,  we  have computed molecular electrostatic potential 21 (ESP) mapped on molecular van der  Waal (vdW) surface of GC5A, 6:0 LPA and the GC5A·6:0 LPA complex (Figure 2e). GC5A is very electrondeficient especially at the upper rim, while LPA is electron-rich especially at the phosphate head. The binding mode between GC5A and LPA is favorable because molecules always tend to approach  each  other  in  a  complementary  manner  of  ESP. Furthermore, the  expected  hydrogen  bonds,  C-H···π,  C-H···O and vdW interactions between GC5A and LPA were validated by atoms-in-molecules and reduced density gradients analysis (see  Supporting  Information).  Geometry  optimization  on  the GC5A·18:0  LPA  complex  gives the reasonably consistent results (Figure S30).\nThe  IDA  principle  based  on  the  GC5A·Fl  reporter  pair allows for a fluorescence 'switch-on' sensing of LPA.

The limit of detection (LOD) for LPA is calculated to be 5.6 nM by utilizing  a  3 σ /slope  method, 22 which  is  far  lower  than  the requisite detection limit in plasma. 3 Compared  with  the currently  reported  fluorescent  probes, 6a-c 5.6  nM  represents the lowest LOD value in LPA detection, indicating the ultrahigh sensitivity of GC5A·Fl.",

In  most  cases,  the addition  of other  biological species caused  no  significant increase  in  the  fluorescence.  The  only  exception  was  ATP, which resulted in even more pronounced fluorescence response than LPA due to the strong binding of ATP with GC5A ( K a =  (4.7 ± 1.4) × 10   M 8 -1 ,  Figure  S24).  Such  an  interference could  be  easily  solved  by  differential  sensing.  Differential sensing relies on the composite response of the analyte to the entire array of receptors instead of single receptor, hence also called  'array  sensing',  providing  output  with  better  accuracy and  more  robust  interference  resistance.  Although  both  the direct  sensing  and  IDA  approaches  can  be  used,  IDA  is  more\ncompatible with differential sensing, because an array can be easily  constructed  by  the  combination  of  multiple  receptors and multiple indicators without additional synthetic efforts. 17b Herein,  GC4A  was  additionally  introduced  as  a  receptor,  and Al(III) phthalocyanine chloride tetrasulfonic acid (AlPcS4, Scheme  S4)  was  introduced  as  an  additional  reporter  dye.

The  major  rationale  behind  the present  differential  sensing  is  that  the  threading  complex  of LPA could be only formed by GC5A, but not by GC4A. The ratio of fluorescence response ( I LPA / I ATP ) in the case of GC5A is thus much larger than that in the case of GC4A.",
