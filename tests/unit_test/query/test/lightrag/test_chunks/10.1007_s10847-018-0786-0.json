The aim was to evaluate both the stoichiometry and the mechanism of the possible complex structure between sulfonate calix[ n ]arenes and ET. The spectroscopic data revealed that a 1:1 binding mode between calixarene and ET was occurred. Furthermore, thermodynamic parameters and fluorescence titration experiments were studied at different temperatures to determine both the quenching mechanism and the type of intermolecular forces in complex formation. Host-guest complexation of sulfonate calix[ n ]arenes and ET could be used to overcome some adverse effects related to the using of ethidium bromide during biological applications as a DNA marker treatment.\nKeywords Ethidium bromide · Calixarene · Inclusion complexation · Fluorescence · DNA marker",

        "content": "Ethidium bromide (ET) is a well-known cationic dye and molecular  probe  for  double  helical  RNA  and/or  DNA chains in gel electrophoresis applications [1]. It is also used in prophylaxis and treatment of animal trypanosomiasis in affected areas [2]. Despite its intense use in gel electrophoresis applications, it must be carefully handled because of its mutagenic and moderately toxic properties [3]. For example, its powder form is harmful if swallowed and very toxic by inhalation, and at higher levels may cause irritation to the upper respiratory system, the eyes, and skin [4]. Based on all of these factors, careless using of ethidium bromide can cause serious health effects in the laboratory as well as an environmental hazard during disposal [5]. If an untreated ethidium bromide waste is poured into a drain or placed in the trash, waste of ethidium bromide may create a potential risk for the environment. Therefore, ethidium bromide solutions must be prepared and handled with little portions in a fume hood and its waste must be evaluated as a special waste [6].\n* Mevlut Bayrakci\nmevlutbayrakci@gmail.com\n1 Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Karamanoglu Mehmetbey University, Karaman, Turkey",

        "content": "Supramolecular complex formation is a new and efficient method for both monitoring and removal of many hazardous substances such as toxic, mutagenic, teratogenic, or radioactive neutral or charged species arising from industrial or clinical applications. This intermolecular complex formation is usually fast and reversible due to prevailing non-covalent interactions. For example, the production of smart new materials as biosensing material-based supramolecular complexation is promising for monitoring or eliminating bio-hazard molecules [7, 8]. In this field, calixarene compounds are important host molecules. Calixarenes are macrocycle compounds made of some phenolic units via methylene bridges [9, 10]. These compounds have been widely used as a host molecule in the supramolecular chemistry, due to their ability to encapsulate organic compounds into their hydrophobic cavities [11, 12]. Owing to the calixarene skeleton, these molecules are able to act as 'molecular baskets' for neutral or charged guests [13]. Calixarene molecules are more soluble compounds in general organic solvents but most importantly calixarene compounds containing hydrophilic units are water-soluble. For instance, sulfonate calixarene derivatives are more favorable host molecules to encapsulate small charged guest molecules in their cavity owing to their better water solubility properties, especially in biomedical applications [14].\nDue to several advantages of water-soluble sulfonate calixarene such as easily synthesis, solubility, and inclusion complexation ability, the objective of this study was to investigate and compare the use of sulfonate calix[ n ] arenes ( n : 4, 6, or 8) for possible host-guest applications between calixarene and ethidium bromide in biological or biochemical areas. The stoichiometry, association constants, and thermodynamic parameters for the inclusion complexes were determined to obtain a quantitative data for the encapsulation of ethidium bromide with calix[ n ]arenes by fluorescence quenching [15, 16]. Furthermore, these parameters may provide some insights regarding the kind of achieved interaction, to understand the mechanism of the highly toxic ethidium bromide action in the cavity of calixarene skeleton.",

The maximal absorption intensity of ET varies markedly upon the addition of different amounts of SC4. These changes in absorption spectra  show  an  interaction  and  complex  formation between ET with SC4. ET indicates the absorption maximum at the wavelength of 212 and 282 nm in aqueous solution. It may be due to the n-σ* and π-π* corresponds to a benzene moiety of ET [19]. The strong absorption peak of ET (100 µM) at wavelength 496 nm decreases and shifts after addition of SC4 and SC8 (0-1000 µM). Similar changes in the spectra of ET are observed for SC6. The strong hypsochromic shift is observed only for SC4 when the concentration ratio of ET:SC4 is 1:4 or higher. An approximately 44 nm strong hypsochromic shift at 496 nm band of ET is observed for SC4 while powerful hypochromic shift is seen at all studied concentrations for SC8. All shifts in absorption bands of ET are probably related to mobilization of ET molecule from the polar environment to the non-polar hydrophobic micro-environment in a cavity of calixarene skeleton. Both hypsochromic and hypochromic shifts at different guest concentrations mentioned above support the possible host-guest complex formation between fluorescence ET and non-fluorescence SC4. Additionally, disappearance of a strong peak of guest ET at the wavelength 212 nm attributable corresponding π-π* transition after addition of calixarene host may also evidence for the possible host-guest complex formation via hydrophobic attractions as π-π interactions. Furthermore, color change of ET from a strong pink to yellowish tone under daylight is also an evidence to support the possible interaction of ET with SC4 (Fig. 3).\nFig. 2 Absorption titration spectra of ET in   H O in the presence of increasing concentration of SC4, SC6, and SC8 (100-1000 µM) 2\nFig. 3 Color changes of ET (100 µM) in the presence of SC4 (100-800 µM) ( a under daylight, b under UV-light)",

ET molecules contain a fluorophore group as phenanthroline which exhibits strong fluorescence signal. ET and calixarene molecules SC4, SC6, and SC8 are found to react forming a complex that results in quenching of the fluorescence of ET. The quenching of ET is measured at 614 nm after excitation at 525 nm (Fig. 4). The interaction of ET with SC4, SC6, and SC8 is evaluated by monitoring an intrinsic fluorescence intensity changes of ET upon addition of calixarene molecules SC4, SC6, and SC8. Fluorescence quenching spectra of ET in the presence of different concentrations of SC4, SC6, and SC8 are shown in Fig. 4. Under experimental conditions, fluorescence spectrum of ET (100 µM) is gradually decreasing with increasing concentrations of studied calixarene molecules (0-1000 µM). This decrease in emission spectra of ET indicates that there is an interaction between ET and SC4, SC6, and SC8. However, calixarene molecules SC4, SC6, and SC8 do not show any fluorescence intensity under the same conditions.",

If the quenching is known to be dynamic, the Stern-Volmer constant will be represented by K D. Otherwise this constant will be described as K SV . K SV represent the Stern-Volmer constant; τ 0 is the average lifetime of ET without SC4 (Quencher), and [ Q ] is the concentration of SC4 (Quencher). The Stern-Volmer plots for ET-SC4 complex formation are given in Fig. 6a. The resulting graph with straight line that provides the determination of the quenching rate constant ( K q ) will have an intercept of 1 and a slope so-called the Stern-Volmer constant ( K sv ). Based on these results, linear plots supporting the static quenching mechanism are observed in the interaction between ET and SC4 [24]. With respect to Eq. (1), the corresponding quenching constants ( K sv ) for the interaction between ET and SC4 are 1.8 × 10  (25 °C, 4 R =  0.9904), 1.6 × 10  (35 °C, 4 R =  0.9970), and 1.4 × 10  L/mol (45 °C, 4 R =  0.9911), respectively. The quenching constants K q are determined as 1.06 × 10 13 at 25 °C, 0.95 ×  10 13 at 35 °C, and 0.83 × 10 13 L/mol·s at 45 °C by using the natural radiative lifetime of ET (about 1.7·10 -9 s), and calculated the slope from Eq. 1, respectively [25]. In literature, it is well known that the maximum scatter collisional quenching constant of various quenchers is around 2.0 × 10 10 L/mol·s [26]. Since values obtained in this study are greater than the maximum collisional quenching constant (2.0  ×  10 10 L/mol·s.), it can be concluded that the quenching mechanism does not include dynamic quenching, but probably static quenching is predominant [27].",

Collisional quenching only affects the excited states of fluorophores, and thus no changes in the absorption spectra are expected. Because collisional quenching just influences the excited state of fluorescent molecule, there is no any respectable changes in the absorption spectra of ET, whereas ground-state complex formation and subsequent static quenching typically cause mentionable changes in the absorption spectrum. As shown in Fig. 2, these changes are seen apparently as blue-shifts with a decrease in absorption intensity of ET upon addition of SC4 at 496 nm. This suggests that the interaction between ET and SC4 is mainly a static quenching\nFig. 6 a The Stern-Volmer plots; b double reciprocal plots of ET with SC4 at 298, 309, and 318 K",

When small molecules bind dependently to a set of equivalent sites on a macromolecule, the binding equilibrium between free and bound molecules can be represented by an equation. The number of ET molecules bound to calixarene skeleton ( n ) and binding constant ( K ) for ET-SC4 system is calculated from the intercept and slope of the plot of log[ F 0 -F F / ]  =  log K + n log Q for the static quenching, respectively (Fig. 6b) [28]. The n value from the slope of the straightline plot is 0.9 in ET-SC4 complex formation. It is noticed that the binding constant values decreased with an increase in temperature due to reduction of stability of ET-SC4 complexes. The binding constant values ( K ) are found as 5.8  ×  10  (25 °C, 2 R 2 =  0.9970), 1.1  ×  10 2 (35 °C, R 2 =  0.9824), and 0.5  ×  10    K 2 - 1 (45 °C, R 2 =  0.9882) at different temperatures. Since a benzyl part of ET molecule enter probably to a hydrophobic cavity of calixarene skeleton, stoichiometric ratio of inclusion complex formation between ET and SC4 should be theoretically 1:1. This theory can be proved if a linear relationship is obtained from the reciprocal plot of 1/ F vs. 1/[ Q ] based on the modified Hildebrand-Benesi Equation [29]. Figure 7a shows reciprocal plots that determine a stoichiometric ratio of an inclusion complex formation. A very good linear relationship is obtained for 1/ F vs. 1/[ Q ] with R 2 =  0.9913. This reciprocal plot clearly indicates that there is a strong binding force between ET and SC4 and the stoichiometry ratio for an inclusion complex formation between ET and SC4 is 1:1 [30].",

NMR is a technique which provides the most evidence for an inclusion of a guest molecule into the hydrophobic cavity of calixarene skeleton in solution. An inclusion of ET in the calixarene cavity is indicated by changing in chemical shift of guest and host protons in a complex structure, compared with chemical shifts of the same protons in pure host or guest.  H NMR spectra of SC4 and SC4-ET 1 complex structures are presented in Fig. 9. From  H NMR 1 data, it is indicated that basic aromatic hydrogen peaks of calixarene skeleton as singlet observed around 7.39 ppm for SC4 is shifted to downfield as 7.58 ppm for SC4-ET (1:1) complex structure. This shift is probably due to the π-π interaction between aromatic rings of both calixarene and ethidium molecules inserted in the cavity. The same peak also shifts to 7.44 ppm for SC4-ET (1:2). When NMR spectrum was recorded with 2-equivalent of added ET (2:1 stoichiometry), signals already altered by 1 equivalent ET are not shifted further considerably. This observation reveals that there is a possibility of only 1:1 binding stoichiometry.

An inclusion complex formation is confirmed by FT-IR and  H-NMR. It has been shown from 1 NMR data that ET is inserted partially into the cavity of SC4 due to favorable formation constant of π-π interactions with benzene rings and hydrogen bonding with polar groups. Besides, various binding parameters have been evaluated. The decreasing K values with an increasing temperature from 298 to 318 K show that static quenching mechanism is occurred between SC4 and ET. Thermodynamic parameters indicate that hydrogen bonding and weak van der Waals interaction are predominant intermolecular forces in complex formation.
