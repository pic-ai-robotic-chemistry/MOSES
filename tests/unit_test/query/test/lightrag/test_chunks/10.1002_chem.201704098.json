Kataev* [a]\nAbstract: A straightforward design of receptors for binding and sensing of sulfate in aqueous medium was developed. The design involves the connection of two naphthalimide-based pH probes through a hydrogen-bonding motif. The structure of the receptor-sulfate complex, predicted by DFT calculations, was unambiguously confirmed by NMR measurements. There are three major interactions stabilizing the host-guest complex: electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and stacking interactions of the dyes. Study of two control receptors containing either one dye or methyl amide groups instead of amides, revealed that electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions contribute the most to affinity and selectivity of receptors. The receptors can detect sulfate in a 1:1 THF-buffer mixture in pH window 3.6-4.5 demonstrating up to 7-fold fluorescence enhancement. To the best of our knowledge, the reported PET (photoinduced electron transfer) anion probes possess the largest response for sulfate in aqueous solution yet described.\nMost of the known PET-based (PET = photoinduced electron transfer) probes for anions and for sulfate in particular undergo quenching of fluorescence upon interactions with anions. [10] Modern applications require either turn-on or ratiometric response. [11] Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and anion binding properties of novel sulfate-selective PET probes with a turn-on response. The developed probes are selective for sulfate in aqueous buffer-THF solutions and can be used for the determination of sulfate in the presence of other competing anions. The design approach suggested in this work represents a general strategy towards sulfate-selective probes working in water and will serve as a starting point to discover future probes for specific applications.",

        "content": "Anion recognition has received much attention over the last two decades due to its possible applications in biological, medical, and industrial areas. [1] Sensing of anions is a more challenging goal than sensing of cations of the same size, because anions have more complex geometries and higher solvation energies. [2] The last fact becomes even more important, if recognition process takes place in a highly competitive medium, such as water. [3] Among all tetrahedral oxyanions, sulfate is an interesting target for recognition and sensing, because sulfate is present in the environment [4] and in living organisms. [5] Several approaches for selective recognition of sulfate in aqueous solution already exist. They include the use of electrostatic interactions, [6] hydrogen bonding [7] or their combinations. [8, 10] However, creating a simple receptor with strong fluorescent response for sulfate in water remains a challenge. [9]\n[a] T. A. Shumilova, Dr. T. R/C252ffer, Prof. Dr. H. Lang, Prof. Dr. E. A.

[11b] We proposed that two positively charged groups placed on an appropriate distance should be sufficient to bind and detect sulfate in aqueous solution. The pH-sensitive dyes should carry these groups as shown in Figure 1. As a linker between two dyes, we used a rigid fragment containing hydrogen bond donor groups, and serving as additional binding sites. The naphthalimide dye, utilized in this work, was recently published by Sessler and Kim demonstrating approximately 21-fold fluorescence enhancement upon lowering the pH of the solution from 11 to 2.

[20] Thus, the corresponding receptors 1 and 2 were prepared. Compounds 3 and 4 were prepared for the control studies to elucidate the roles of the second naphthalimide-piperazine fragment and NH-sites on the properties of receptors. Pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide is known to form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the pyridine nitrogen favoring a relatively rigid syn,syn -conformation of the NH-groups even in aqueous solution. [6c] To provide additional flexibility for receptors, we introduced an ethylamine linker between the pyridine and the dye. We expected that this flexibility should be an important requirement to allow two naphthalimide dyes to form p p --interactions in the complex with sulfate and to isolate the anion from the solvent molecules. [21] To find out if such an arrangement of the naphthalimide rings is possible, we performed DFT calculations of 1 H2 2 + with sulfate. The conformational search yielded three minima with structures shown in Figure 2. Structure I has the\nFigure 2. Optimized structures I -III of 1Â· H2 SO4 .

The pH values in all our experiments reflect the pH of the aqueous phase and not of the solvent mixture. This simplification was used for the sake of fast screening of receptor properties even though the protonation state of the solution/ receptor might differ in water and THF-water mixtures. The pH-dependent fluorescence was also recorded in the presence of an excess of sulfate and phosphate (Figure 4a). Interestingly, the presence of sulfate shifts the original curve (S1) towards basic pH values by almost one pH unit. Similar behavior was observed for receptor 2 , whereas 3 did not show any shifts (Figure S3). Thus, these results indicate a strong binding of sulfate by 1 and 2 , which in turn induces a p K a shift of the piperazine amine groups. To provide an evidence that coordination of sulfate causes the protonation equilibrium to concomitantly shift to a higher protonated state of the receptor, we measured UV/Vis spectra of receptor 1 at different pH values. The observed spectral changes were compared with those detected by titration of 1 with sulfate at a constant pH valuepH 4.1. Lowering the pH of the solution induces a hypsochromic shift of the absorption maximum (Figure 4c). The titration of 1 with Na SO 2 4 resulted in similar changes, yielding log K = 3.58 /C6 0.01. Based on Figure 4a, the fluorescence increase upon addition of an excess of sulfate to the receptors can be predicted. For instance, the fluorescence of the solution will be increased by approximately 7-fold (shown with an arrow) if 100 equiv of sulfate are added to 1 .",

Addition of sulfate to 1 and 2 induced the strongest fluorescence enhancement, while Iodide led to a decrease of fluorescence due to the dynamic quenching process. [22] Analysis of the obtained binding constants (Table 1) leads to the conclusion that the receptors bind sulfate about 100 times stronger than other anions.

[24] The authors reported that sterically large anions often suppress cation-anion interactions, which leads to increased fluorescence intensity.\nTo understand how the amount of charge on the receptor reflects its binding and emission properties, we carried out a series of titrations for 1 with sulfate at different pH values. The higher the pH values of the solution is, the less positive charge the receptor should carry. As can be inferred from Figure 5, increasing the pH of the solution leads to a decrease of binding constants. However, the overall fluorescence enhancement increases until the maximum (7-fold) at pH 4.4 and then slightly decrease, albeit keeping the saturation point the same. The competition fluorescence experiments with different anions showed that only oxalate increases the error of sulfate detection (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information).

The naphthalimide protons (h, d, f) in the aromatic area were also shifted, which indicates that sulfate binding induces conformational changes in the structure. On the other hand, the pyridine protons (p, q) moved towards high field suggesting the formation of hydrogen bonds between NH-donor sites and the anion.\nNext, we prepared control receptor 4 bearing methyl amide groups. [25] According to 1 H NMR, receptor 4 exists as a mixture of conformers with a dynamic exchange at room temperature, which disappears at 50 8 C (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The pH scanning experiment revealed that addition of sulfate did induce a p Ka shift, though the shift was much smaller than that for 1 or 2 (Figure S4).
