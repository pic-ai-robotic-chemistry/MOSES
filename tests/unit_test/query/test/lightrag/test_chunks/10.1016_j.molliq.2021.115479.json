In this work, we investigate the molecular recognition of tripeptides containing N-terminal phenylalanine (Phe, F) by synthetic macrocyclic receptor Cucurbit[7]uril (CB [7]) in aqueous solution by molecular dynamics simulations. We found that among twenty amino acids (AAs), the binding of CB[7] to Phe is the strongest. Based on that a series of tripeptides containing N-terminal Phe (with the second residue Gly (G) /uniFB01 xed) are designed to explore the effects of adjacent AA residues on the binding to CB[7]. It is indicated that, in contrast to FGG, only when the 3rd-residue is Glu (E), Lys (K), or Arg (R), the binding af /uniFB01 nity with CB[7] can reach the nanomolar level. For the most prominent FGE, the binding free energy with CB[7] is -12.8 kcal/mol, with association constant ( K a ) of 2.1 × 10 9 M 1 . It is surprising that once reversing the -sequence order of the 2nd-residue and 3rd-residue from FGX to FXG (X = E, K, R), or inserting a second Gly in the middle of FGX, such as FGGX, the binding af /uniFB01 nity is signi /uniFB01 cantly changed, with K a decreased more than 3 orders of magnitude. These results predicted the high binding af /uniFB01 nity and sequence selectivity of CB[7] to containing N-terminal Phe peptides, which are bene /uniFB01 cial to predict the recognition sites of speci /uniFB01 c proteins/peptides and to design host-guest complexes with high af /uniFB01 nity.",

Noncovalent interactions, such as ion-dipole, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding (H-bond), and van der Waals ( v dW) are the major driving forces in these recognition processes.\nCucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), derived from the Cucurbiturils family with the high af /uniFB01 nity [13], owns good water solubility [14] and extraordinary binding af /uniFB01 nities with various guest molecules in aqueous solution [14], which makes it exhibit promising applications in biochemical [14,15], biomedical [11,12], and material science [8,16].

Wei and co-workers screened out native insulin and human growth hormone from human serum via targeting of CB[7] towards N-terminal Phe residue [11]. In addition, Webberetal. proposed that covalent modi /uniFB01 edCB[7] could recognize insulin by encapsulating the N-terminal Phe residue, and the stability of insulin could be increased without affecting the bioactivity of insulin [18]. It is also found that CB[7] could inhibit the /uniFB01 brillation of human calcitonin (by binding with the aromatic groups of Phe or Tyr) [7] and insulin/amyloid (by capturing Phe residue) [19], and then improved their bioactivity. Based on the above surveys, CB[7] recognizes proteins/peptides by targeting single aromatic AA residue, and the high af /uniFB01 nity and selectivity of CB[7] towards AAs are key to recognitions. Therefore, the binding energies of several aromatic CB[7]/AAs in water had been researched by the theoretical and experimental methods [17,20], which indicated that the binding of CB[7] and aromatic Phe is the most strongest.\nCompared with single AA, the structures of short peptides can better re /uniFB02 ect the actual con /uniFB01 guration of protein.

Besides, CB[8] could also bind with nonaromatic peptides with submicromolar af /uniFB01 nities, such as Met-Terminated Peptides, by simultaneously encapsulating two neighboring non-aromatic-type residues into CB[8] cavity [24]. Due to the restriction of cavity volume, CB [7] can only encapsulate single AA forming 1:1 ratio complex [14], it is impossible to regulate the binding strength by simultaneously encapsulating two adjacent AA residues into the cavity like CB[8]. Nevertheless, the binding af /uniFB01 nities of CB[7] to peptides are also sequence-dependent [17,27], for example, the binding af /uniFB01 nity of CB[7] to Phe-Gly-Gly (FGG) is stronger than GFG and GGF [17].

The host-guest binding enthalpies ∆ H and the corresponding energy decomposition terms are shown in Fig. 2b and Table S1. Here the ∆ H for each system is decomposed into three contributions: one is the change of Lennard-Jones force /uniFB01 eld term (LJ), which primarily models v dWforces;one is the contribution of Coulombic electrostatic interaction (elec); one is the change of valence terms (val), comprising of bond-stretch, angle-bend, and dihedral terms [40].

As shown in Table 1, the K a of CB[7]/FGE (2.1 × 10 9 M 1 ), CB -[7]/FGK (4.7 × 10 8 M 1 ) and CB[7]/FGR (2.8 × 10 -8 M 1 ) is 4 --5orders of magnitude larger than that of CB[7]/FGG (see Table 1). The corresponding ∆ G ( -12.8, -11.9 and -11.6 kcal/mol) of the three CB[7]/FGX (E, K, R) are larger than that of CB[8]/YLA ( -11.2 kcal/mol), which was reported with nanomolar binding af /uniFB01 nity [23], therefore, the binding af/uniFB01 nities of our designing three complexes (CB[7]/FGE, CB[7]/FGK and CB[7]/FGR) should also be at the nanomolar level.",

        "content": "For each CB[7]/FGX complex, entropy plays a key role in the binding process. The main contribution is from the entropy change of guest molecule (-T Δ S Guest ), and the corresponding contribution of the host molecule (-T Δ S Host ) could be neglectable because of its rigid feature (Fig. 5c). These could be further demonstrated by the conformational change of host and guest molecules before and after complex formation. Take CB [7]/FGY as an example, the distance projections of two representative carbon-atom pairs of CB[7] are almost the same (Fig. 5d), thus the values of -T Δ S Host are usually small (Fig. 5c), while the distance projections of the other two representative carbon-atom pairs (backbone and side chain of FGY) for free and complex states are signi /uniFB01 cantly different (Fig. 5e), the more localized distributions of the distance projections for FGYafter complexation indicates the conformation of FGY is strongly restricted after binding with CB[7], therefore the value of -T Δ S Guest is large.",

It is obvious that the binding free energies of FGGX (X = E, K, R) signi /uniFB01 cantly increase by 9.9, 11.5 and 14.1 kcal/mol, respectively, and the corresponding K a decreases about 7 -10 orders of magnitude (Fig. 6b and Table S4). Besides, the ∆ G for CB[7]/FGGR is even positive, due to the in /uniFB02 uence of the fourth residue Arg (R), that is, the binding of CB[7] towards FGGR is dif /uniFB01 cult. Therefore, inserting a second Gly in the middle of FGX is unfavorable to binding with CB[7]. In respect to CB[7]/FGG ( -12.4 kcal/ mol), ∆ H of CB[7]/FGGK and CB[7]/FGGR are more positive ( -8.8 and -8.3 kcal/mol), because the interaction between the fourth residue Lys/Arg and CB[7] is weak (see the IGM results in Fig. S7), moreover the conformations of phenyl ring inside CB[7] cavity are also different from that of CB[7]/Phe, which indicates that the hydrophobic interactions decrease after extending the chain length of peptides. Therefore, extending the chain length of the peptide by inserting the second Gly residue",

        "content": "In this work, we systematically investigated the binding characteristics between CB[7] and all twenty AAs in aqueous solution and explored the binding strength of CB[7] towards a series of tripeptides by the MD method. It is indicated that there are three binding manners between CB [7] and single AA: ( ) exclusion complex (Gly, Ala, Ser and Asp), (II) parΙ tial inclusion complex (Pro, Thr, Cys and Val), and (III) inclusion complex (all other AAs with large side chains). Among them, the binding af /uniFB01 nity of CB[7] towards Phe is the strongest, therefore CB[7] prefers to recognize Phe residue in the real environment, which is consistent with many experimental results [21]. Next, a series of tripeptides containing N-terminal Phe are further designed to explore the effects of adjacent AA residues on the binding with CB[7]. The result indicates that, in contrast to FGG, only when the 3rd-residue is Glu, Lys or Arg, that is FGX (X = E, K or R), the binding strength can increase obviously. For the most prominent CB[7/]FGE, the binding free energy is -12.8 kcal/mol, with the corresponding association constant ( K a ) of 2.1 × 10 9 M 1 , -re /uniFB02 ecting the nanomolar binding af /uniFB01 nity. It is surprising that their binding af /uniFB01 nities are signi /uniFB01 cantly reduced once reversing the sequence order of the 2nd-residue and 3rd-residue (from FGX to FXG), or inserting the second Gly in FGX middle (from FGE to FGGE), with K a decreased more than 3 orders of magnitude. These results indicate that the recognition of CB[7] towards the peptides containing N-terminal Phe is signi /uniFB01 cant sequence selectivity, which could provide useful clues to CB [7] recognizing speci /uniFB01 c proteins/peptides and designing reasonable host-guest complexes with high af /uniFB01 nities.",
