Some classical synthetic supramolecular macrocyclic hosts, including crown ethers, 2 cyclodextrins, 3 cucurbiturils, 4 calixarenes, 5 have been elaborately modified to efficiently interact with a manifold of substrates from metal ions, neutral molecules to organic cations/ anions in aqueous solution. Pillararenes, made up of hydroquinone units linked by methylene bridges at the para -positions, have recently stimulated a tremendous upsurge of interest and have been defined as a new generation of macrocyclic host molecules in supramolecular chemistry due to their unique symmetric pillar-shaped scaffolds, facile tunable functionality, as well as intriguing host-guest binding abilities. 6",

Compound CWP7 was prepared in a moderate route (Scheme 1). Neutral pillararene BrP7 with bromoethoxy groups was firstly synthesized through the cyclization of monomer with paraformaldehyde in the presence of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate as catalyst in 1, 2-dichloroethane. It's worth noting that this is a thermodynamic controlled reversible Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction, higher reaction temperature and longer reaction time will go against the preparation of BrP7, so the real-time monitoring of the reaction is necessary. Treating BrP7 with excess amount of trimethylamine (30 equiv.) in methanol at reflux, compound CWP7 containing fourteen trimethylammonium moieties at upper and lower rims was given as a colorless solid. As expected, pillar[7]\nScheme 1.

        "content": "Due to the presence of fourteen trimethylammonium groups on the macrocyclic ring, cationic pillar[7]arene can act as a desired host for various anionic guest molecules. Considering that pillar [7]arene posesses a relatively larger cavity size (with a diameter of ca . 8.7 Å), which is similar to that of c -cyclodextrin ( ca . 8.3 Å) and cucurbit[8]uril (with a portal diameter of ca . 6.9 Å and an internal diameter of ca . 8.8 Å), 9 sodium pyren-1-olate ( G ) was selected as a guest to study the binding behavior of CWP7 in aqueous media. In order to investigate the size-selectivity of the hostguest complexation between CWP7 and G , the host-guest complexation between CWP6 and G was also studied.\nThe host-guest interaction between CWP7 and G in water was firstly studied by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the 1 H NMR spectra of G in D2O recorded in the absence and presence of approximately 1.0 equiv. of the host. Only one set of the peaks was observed, indicating the fast exchange complexation on the NMR timescale. Compared with the spectrum of free G (Fig. 1a), the resonance peaks related to protons Ha-i of G displayed substantial upfield shifts in the presence of CWP7 (Fig. 1b) as a consequence of inclusion-induced shielding effects. On the other hand, slight upfield shift change of the aromatic protons (H1) on the framework of the pillararene host was also observed, which may be attributed to the ring current effects resulted from the p -stacking interactions between the pyrene ring of the guest and the ben-\nFig. 1.

As shown in Fig. 2, nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) correlations were observed between protons Hd /C0 f on G and protons H2-5 on CWP7 respectively, while no NOE was observed between protons Ha, Hb and Hc on G and protons H3,4 on CWP7 , suggesting that protons Hd, He and Hf were located in the cavity of CWP7 .\nIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) investigation was conducted to provide thermodynamic insight into the complexation between CWP7 and G . From Fig. 3, the K a value of CWP7 /C27 G was determined to be (1.28 ± 0.19) /C2 10 4 M 1 /C0 in 1:1 complexation. The binding affinity of this host-guest system can be attributed to the multiple electrostatic interactions between the cationic trimethylammonium groups on the rigid pillar[7]arene platform and the anionic pyren-1-olate part, p -stacking interactions between the pyrene ring and the host, and hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions. Meanwhile, the enthalpy and entropy changes were also obtained ( D H < 0, D S > 0, | D H | < | T D S |), indicating that this complexation was primarily driven by the entropy change with enthalpic assistance.",

As shown in Fig. S8, in the presence of equimolar CWP6 , the resonance peaks related to protons of G also displayed upfield shifts compared to free G , indicating the existence of interactions between CWP6 and G . In order to verify if the guest G could thread into the cavity of pillararene CWP6 , the 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy was further conducted (Fig. S9). As expected, nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) correlations were observed only between protons Hi on G and protons H1-3 on CWP6 respectively, while no NOE was observed between other protons on G and protons on CWP6 , suggesting that guest G located outside the cavity of CWP6 . From the above results, the chemical shifts of the resonance peaks related to protons of G is mainly ascribed to the electrostatic interactions between CWP6 and G , while the guest molecule is too large to thread into the cavity of CWP6 . Compared with the host-guest investigations between G and CWP7 , the size-selectively complexation with the host molecules was clearly observed for G . In other words, host-guest inclusion complex between G and CWP7 can be formed while that between G and CWP6 can't.\nComplexation of fluorescent pigments by synthetic macrocyclic hosts is a fascinating area which has attracted considerable interest in supramolecular chemistry. 11 Upon forming the host-guest complex, macrocyclic hosts can cause a de-aggregating effect to the\nFig. 2.

Most importantly, the fluorescence quantum yields and photo-stabilities of the pigments could be remarkably enhanced. Sodium pyren-1olate, as a typical pyrene derivative, could emit blue light ( /C24 450 nm) upon excitation at 365 nm, while due to the strong p -p stacking interactions between the pyrene rings, the fluorescent intensity will be decreased by aggregation caused fluorescence quench effect. Therefore, the host-guest complexation induced fluorescence enhancement was observed in this system.

Such increased fluorescence intensities can be continually observed during the inclusion complexation and mainly attributed to the changed microenvironment inside the cavities of macrocyclic hosts and to a dimensional restriction effect which can go against deactivation pathways, such as p p -stacking interactions in this system . Due to the formation of host-guest inclusion complex, the p p -stacking between the pyrene rings was weakened, thereby improving the dispersibility and solubility of G in water, and leading to the fluorescence enhancement.",

The presence of fourteen positive charges on its both rims endows it great potential to act as an ideal receptor for anionic guest molecules. Furthermore, this water-soluble pillar[7]arene could bind sodium pyren-1-olate and form a [2]pseudorotaxane mainly driven by electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions and p p -interactions in aqueous solution. Additionally, the host-guest complexation induced fluorescence enhancement of the guest was investigated. The successful preparation of this novel water-soluble macrocyclic host can provide more opportunities for researchers devoting themselves to working in the field of host-guest chemistry. This new molecular recognition motif with fluorescent enhanced property can be further applied in the construction of other functional supramolecular systems, including chemo-sensors, fluorescence imaging and drug delivery carriers.",
