However, the lack of concrete evidence (such as a publication or instance) for the specific combination of 'electrochemical sensor' + 'IDA' + 'quinine' means the answer does not fully satisfy the query's intent for accuracy. The absence of information sources for quinine further reduces confidence in the result's accuracy for this context.")], message="The query results are incomplete and do not fully satisfy the user's intent. While the ontology data is consistent and plausible, there is no concrete instance or publication directly demonstrating an electrochemical sensor using IDA for quinine detection, nor are there information sources for quinine in this context. Improvements are needed to provide a more direct and sourced answer.", improvement_suggestions=['Explicitly search for and return concrete instances or publications where an electrochemical sensor uses IDA to detect quinine.', "Ensure that the 'information' field for 'quinine' includes relevant detection context or references.", 'Return information sources (e.g., DOIs, publication titles) for quinine as a detection target in the context of electrochemical sensors and IDA.', "Deduplicate property values and standardize class naming conventions (e.g., casing of 'IDA' vs. 'ida')."])}]
