Within this broad paradigm,\\noligopyrrolic cages have garnered attention due to their responsive recognition features. Due\\nto the presence of slightly polar pyrrole subunits which can also behave as hydrogen-bonding\\ndonors, these oligopyrrolic cages are potential receptors for various polarized species. In this\\nAccount, we summarize recent advances involving the syntheses and study of (1) covalent\\noligopyrrolic macrobicyclic cages, (2) oligopyrrolic metallacages, and (3) oligopyrrolic\\nnoncovalently linked cages. Considered in concert, these molecular constructs have allowed\\nadvances in applied supramolecular chemistry; to date, they have been exploited for selective\\nguest encapsulation studies, anion binding and ion-channel formation, and gas absorption,\\namong other applications. While key ﬁndings from others will be noted, in this Account will\\nfocus on our own contributions to the chemistry of discrete oligopyrrolic macrocycles and\\ntheir use in supramolecular host−guest chemistry and sensing applications. In terms of speciﬁcs, we will detail how oligopyrrole\\ncages with well-deﬁned molecular geometries permit reversible guest binding under ambient conditions and how the incorporation\\nof pyrrole subunits within larger superstructures allows eﬀective control over anion/conjugate acid binding activity under ambient\\nconditions. We will also provide examples that show how derivatization of these rudimentary macrocyclic cores with various\\nsterically congested β-substituted oligopyrroles can provide entry into more complex supramolecular architectures. In addition, we\\nwill detail how hybrid systems that include heterocycles other than pyrrole, such as pyridine and naphthyridine, can be used to create\\nself-assembled materials that show promise as gas-absorbing materials and colorimetric reversible sensors. Studies involving\\noligopyrrolic polymetallic cages and oligopyrrolic supramolecular cages will also be reviewed. First, we will discuss all-carbon-linked\\noligopyrrolic bicycles and continue on to present systems linked via amines and imines linkages. Finally, we will summarize recent\\nwork on pyrrolic cages created through the use of metal centers or various noncovalent interactions. We hope that this Account will\\nprovide researchers with an initial foundation for understanding oligopyrrolic cage chemistry, thereby allowing for further advances\\nin the area. It is expected that the fundamental design and recognition principles made in the area of oligopyrrole cages, as\\nexempliﬁed by our contributions, will be of general use to researchers targeting the design of functional molecular systems.

       " {'content': '1. INTRODUCTION\\nThis Account is concerned with the chemistry of pyrrolic cage\\nsystems. Cages of this general class have been the focus of\\nincreasing attention since the late 1990s. However, in many\\nrespects the antecedents for work in this area can be traced to the\\nrevolutionary report of laterally symmetric macrobicyclic\\n“cryptands”5 and “cryptates”6 by Lehn et al. in 1969 as well as\\nthe 1968 report of Simmons and Park of anion binding within a\\nbicyclic diammonium construct.7 A spotlight was shown on the\\ncryptands with the awarding of a share of the 1987 Nobel Prize\\nin Chemistry to Lehn, who codiﬁed “supramolecular chemistry”\\nas the chemistry beyond the molecule.8 To date, more than 2000\\npapers have detailed the synthesis, derivatization, and\\napplication of cryptands and their supramolecular complexes\\nto problems running the gamut from fundamental to applied.\\nThis activity reﬂects in large measure the fact that these\\nmacrobicyclic hosts can act as artiﬁcial synthetic organic (or\\nmetal−organic hybrid) receptors for a wide variety of ionic\\nguests, including protons (H+) and ammonium (NH4\\n+, R2NH2\\n+,\\netc.), alkali, alkaline earth, transition metal, and actinide cations,\\nalong with various negatively charged anionic species. The\\nspeciﬁcs of binding depend, not surprisingly, on the structural\\nfeatures, geometries, functionalities, and electronic environ-\\nments (e.g., neutral or charged) provided by the cryptand host\\nwith guest binding being seen within the internal cavities or\\noutside clefts or both.\\nIncorporation of pyrroles into bicyclic frameworks creates\\ncryptand-like frameworks that can act as potential functional\\nmaterials. This functionality can be augmented by including\\nother heterocycles, such as pyridine or naphthyridine, within the\\nsuperstructures.3,9 Incorporation of chelating units can provide\\nfor metal-based self-assembly, while the use of β-substituted\\noligopyrroles can support the formation of complex supra-\\nmolecular architectures. As a class, oligopyrrolic macrocyclic\\ncages have been explored for a wide variety of functions,\\nincluding use as potential receptors, sensors, and gas storage\\nsystems. The goal of this Account is to review our contributions\\nto this area within the framework of the ﬁeld as a whole.\\nExcluded from this Account will be double-walled and\\nmultiwalled bis-calix[4]pyrroles since they have been the subject\\nof recent reviews.10,11',\n",

Distinctive broad\\nabsorption maxima (λmax) at 421 and 474 nm were taken as\\nevidence for the generation of partially oxidized species in\\nsolution where the characteristic “porphyrin-like” features (e.g.,\\nan absorption spectrum containing both a sharp Soret band and\\nweaker “Q” bands) are absent. In contrast to what was observed\\nin the X-ray structure of 1 where the two bridging apical −CH\\nhydrogen atoms were seen to point inward (endo−endo\\norientation), the sp2-hybridized bridging carbon atom produces\\na degree of local planarity. The net result is that cage 4 possesses\\na more open cavity (cf. Figure 2, inset) that was expected to\\nfacilitate the “inside binding” of guests.\\nWhile this Account is mainly focused on our own\\ncontributions, we would like to make clear that subsequent to\\nour initial report of bicycle 1, many elegant oligopyrrolic cages\\nwere reported by other research groups.

       " {'content': '\\x0cThis phenyl-bridgehead oligopyrrolic cryptand cage contains\\nboth imine (hydrogen-bonding acceptor) and amide (hydro-\\ngen-bonding donor) functionalities within its side arms. The\\nlatter receptor and its analogues were explored as potential\\nsupramolecular hosts for speciﬁc anions. It was found that cage\\n18 exhibits speciﬁcity toward tetrahedral oxyanions, e.g.,\\nH2PO4\\n−, HP2O7\\n3−, SO4\\n2−, and HSO4\\n−, in the noncompetitive\\nsolvent chloroform at 298 K. This selectivity is reﬂected in the\\ncalculated Ka values of 1.56 × 104 M−1 for TBAH2PO4, 1.76 ×\\n106 M−1 for (TBA)3HP2O7, 2.66 × 106 M−1 for (TBA)2SO4, and\\n4.53 × 106 M−1 for TBAHSO4, respectively.\\nHere, it was postulated that the amidic and pyrrolic protons\\ncould act as hydrogen-bond donors to the oxygen atom, whereas\\none or more imine nitrogen atoms could serve as hydrogen-\\nbond acceptors for the OH protons present in H2PO4\\n−. As\\ninferred from single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis, the\\nH2PO4\\n−anion was found to be nestled within the cavity of\\ncage 18 and apparently was stabilized by such interactions\\n(Figure 4b).\\nA similar [1 + 1] Schiﬀ-base condensation reaction between\\nthe phenyl-bridgehead trialdehyde (20) and the triamine (16)\\nallowed the macrobicyclic imine cage 21 to be synthesized\\n(Scheme 4a).30 In contrast to what was observed in the case of\\ncage 18, the alkyl−imine-linked system 21 was characterized by\\nselectivity for the ﬂuoride anion, as evidenced by Ka values of\\n1.01 × 107 M−1 for TBAF for cage 21 vs 1.57 × 106 M−1 for\\namide−imine cage 18 determined by the absorption spectro-\\nscopic titration method at 298 K. This selectivity was ascribed to\\nthe rigidity and comparatively smaller cavity size of cage 21 as\\ncompared to 18.

OLIGOPYRROLIC NONCOVALENTLY LINKED\\nCAGES\\nCurrently, a number of organic cages53−56 prepared using\\ncovalent bonds including, inter alia, dynamic covalent\\nbonds18−26,57−60 are known. These impressive contributions\\nhave provided a springboard for the no less challenging task of\\ncreating cage- or capsule-like systems based on noncovalent\\ninteractions.61−68 Several of the authors of this Account have\\ncontributed to the development of the latter theme; they\\nreported4,69 the all-organic self-assembled dimeric cage-like\\nreceptors (41)2 and (42)2 (cf. Scheme 7). These supramolecular\\nsystems, constructed from the acyclic pyridyl−/naphthyridyl−\\npolypyrrolic molecular building blocks 41 and 42, respectively,\\nare stabilized via quadruple hydrogen-bonding interactions\\nbetween individual “U”-shaped acyclic units (41 or 42).\\nNotably, both (41)2 and (42)2 are stable in the solid state in\\nCHCl3, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dimethyl sulfoxide\\n(DMSO) solution and even in the gas phase as evidenced\\nfrom various spectroscopic analyses and single-crystal X-ray\\ndiﬀraction studies (Figure 8). Depending on the pKa values of\\nthe acid guests in question as determined in aqueous solution,\\nthese self-assembled cages act as potential acid receptors. In\\nTHF solution, receptor (41)2 was found to bind eﬀectively only\\nstrong acids having pKa values of below ca. −1.92 (e.g.,\\nmethanesulfonic acid (MSA), p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA),\\nHNO3, H2SO4, and HCl). In contrast, receptor (42)2 proved to\\nbe an excellent receptor for biologically relevant organic\\ndicarboxylic acids with pKa < 2.8 in water (e.g., oxalic acid,\\nmaleic acid, and to a lesser extent malonic acid). It was also\\nfound to bind the same strong organic and mineral test acids that\\nwere recognized by receptor (41)2.\\nIt was speculated that the acids protonate the pyridyl or\\nnaphthyridyl moieties ﬁrst, which creates a positively charged\\nenvironment within the cavity of receptors (41)2 and (42)2\\nsuitable for counteranion recognition. However, weaker acids\\n(e.g., acids having pKa > 2.8 in water) were deemed unlikely to\\ninduce this protonation even in the case of the more basic cage,\\n(42)2; therefore, these acids do not interact with the receptor.\\nOn this basis, the acid capture seen in organic media was termed\\n“proton-coupled anion recognition”. Consistent with this\\nsuggestion, washing the receptor−acid complexes produced\\nfrom (41)2 and (42)2 with water was found to regenerate the\\ncorresponding pristine cage with a visible color change. This\\ncapture and release could be repeated several times without any\\ndegradation of the constituent receptor units.\\nFurther studies of the pyridine-containing tetrapyrrolic\\nmonomer 41 revealed subtleties associated with its self-\\nassembly. The discrete self-assembled cage form (41)2 used\\nfor the acid capture experiments was obtained by allowing\\nprecursor 41 to crystallize from the relatively noncoordinating\\nsolvent CHCl3. However, when this same building block was\\ncrystallized from more polar and presumably better coordinating\\nsolvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or DMF, an inﬁnite\\n“zig-zag” hydrogen-bonded network (41)n was obtained (cf.\\nScheme 7.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\\nMacrobicyclic receptors inspired by Lehn’s seminal work on\\ncryptands and other early contributions to molecule recognition\\ncontinue to attract tremendous attention within the supra-\\nmolecular community. Eﬀort is being devoted not only to\\nexploring new synthetic strategies, such as those based on\\ndynamic combinatorial chemistry and controlled metal\\ncoordination, but also to investigating the functional properties\\nof the resulting systems including in the areas of selective ion\\nrecognition, carbohydrate binding and neutral guest capture,\\nselective gas adsorption, and luminescent and electrochemical\\nsensor development to highlight a few topical themes.\\nOligopyrrolic macrobicyclic systems are rather new additions\\nto the ever-expanding cryptand-like cage ﬁrmament. There thus\\nremains a large scope for further contributions in terms of both\\ndesigning and synthesizing new classes of oligopyrrolic macro-\\nbicyclic receptors and exploring their recognition features. New\\nmembers of this class with presumed new functions can likely be\\nobtained by expanding the scope of pyrrolic building blocks used\\nfor their creation to include precursors that bear functional\\ngroups, such as free amines or carboxylate moieties, or which\\nincorporate ﬂuorescent subunits. The resulting putative systems\\nmight be expected to display enhanced recognition features or\\ndisplay optical and electronic properties that would make them\\nof interest as sensors, redox-active or photoactive switches, or\\npotential ion carriers. Given these opportunities for future\\ncontributions, in this Account, we have attempted to summarize\\nrecent progress in the area of oligopyrrolic cryptands with a\\nfocus on their molecular design, synthesis, self-assembly, and\\npotential applications. Our hope is that this summary will inspire\\nthe further study of “chemistry within cages” and will accelerate\\nspeciﬁcally the development of pyrrole-based cryptand-like\\nsystems in the context of supramolecular chemistry and\\nmaterials-related research.',\n",
