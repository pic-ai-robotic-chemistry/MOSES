The interactions can be divided into three binding types at pH = 7.0. Experimental results from the present study showed that the host displays a strong binding to the aromatic amino acids, Trp and Phe, and the guests of Lys, Arg, and His lie outside the cavity portal of the host. Meanwhile, the alkyl moieties of the guests Met, Leu, and Ile were accommodated within the cavity of iQ[7], but there was no signi /uniFB01 cant interaction between iQ[7] and Thr or Val. The complexation behavior of iQ[7] with essential amino acids was explored at pH = 3, and the binding of Lys, Arg, and His revealed an unexpected behavior, with their side chains located in the cavity of iQ[7], whereas those of the aromatic Trp and Phe were deeper within the iQ[7] cavity. The alkyl side chains of the guests Met, Leu, Ile, Thr, and Val were also located inside the iQ[7] cavity and formed the host -guest complexes.",

Figure 1 shows the 1 H NMR spectra of Lys recorded in the absence and presence of approximately 1.0 equiv of the host in D2O, and D2O was adjusted to pD = 7.0 with sodium phosphate. In the presence of iQ[7], the peaks for all methylene protons of Lys display a substantial down eld /uniFB01 shift compared with those of the free guest, indicating that all methylene protons interact with the carbonyl groups of iQ[7]. It has been reported that the 1 H NMR peaks of the guest protons inside the low-polarizability cavity of Q[ n ] shift up /uniFB01 eld, and interactions with the carbonyl oxygen molecules of Q[ n ] result in down eld shifts owing to /uniFB01 the deshielding of the protons. 21,39,40 Additionally, the signal corresponding to the α -proton of the amino acid (H ) is shifted α down eld ( /uniFB01 Δ δ = 0.37 ppm).

As shown in Figure 2, all aromatic protons (H γ -H ) η of Trp move up eld /uniFB01 considerably and are broadened compared with those of the free guest as a consequence of inclusion-induced shielding e /uniFB00 ects.

These observations suggest that the CH 2 group and indole moiety of the Trp guest are encapsulated in the cavity of the iQ[7] host.

Ten essential Lα -amino acids were purchased from Aldrich. iQ[7] was prepared and puri /uniFB01 ed according to our previously published procedure. 33 All other\nreagents were of analytical grade and were used as received. Double-distilled water was used for all experiments.\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance Measurements. All 1 H NMR spectra, including those for titration experiments, were measured on a Varian INOVA-400 NMR spectrometer with SiMe4 as an internal reference at 20 ° C. D2O was used as a /uniFB01 eld-frequency lock, and the observed chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to that for the internal standard (TMS at 0.0 ppm). The ratio of amino acids versus iQ[7] was calculated by the ratio of their integral areas for special peaks. The concentrations of the amino acids were 1.0 × 10 -4 mol/L in the NMR experiments. D2O was adjusted to pD = 7.0 with sodium phosphate. The value was veri /uniFB01 ed on a pH meter calibrated with two standard bu /uniFB00 er solutions. D2O was adjusted to pD = 3.0 with 1 M DCl. The pD = 3 of the solution was also veri /uniFB01 ed on a calibrated pH meter.\nUV -Vis Absorption and Fluorescence Emission Spectra. UV -vis absorption spectra of the host -guest complexes were recorded with an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Fluorescence spectra measurements were performed on a Varian Cary Eclipse /uniFB02 uorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a xenon discharge lamp at room temperature. The absorption and /uniFB02 uorescence titration experiments were performed as follows: 200.0 μ L of 1.0 × 10 -3 mol/L stock solution of Trp and various amounts of 1.0 × 10 -4 mol/L iQ[7] aqueous solution were transferred into a 10 mL volumetric /uniFB02 ask, and then the volumetric /uniFB02 ask was /uniFB01 lled to the /uniFB01 nal volume with distilled water. The pH was adjusted to pH = 7 with sodium phosphate.",

        "content": "ITC Measurements. Microcalorimetric experiments were performed using an isothermal titration calorimeter Nano ITC (TA, USA). The heat evolved was recorded at 298.15 K. The heat of the reaction was corrected for the heat of the dilution of the guest solution determined in separate experiments. All solutions were degassed prior to the titration experiment by sonication. A stock solution (1.0 × 10 -3 mol/L) of amino acids and 1.0 × 10 -4 mol/L stock solution of iQ[7] were prepared with 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). A typical ITC titration was carried out by titrating the Lα -amino acid solution (pH = 7, 1.0 × 10 -3 mol/L, 6 μ L of aliquots, at 250 s intervals) into an iQ[7] solution. The concentration of iQ[7] in the sample cell (1.3 mL) was 1.0 × 10 -4 mol/L at pH = 7. Computer simulations (curve /uniFB01 tting) were performed using the Nano ITC analyze software. First points in the ITC data were excluded when /uniFB01 tting the model to acquire the binding constant, enthalpy change, and entropy change.\nMALDI-TOF MS. MALDI-TOF MS spectra were recorded on a Bruker BIFLEX III ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer with α -cyano-4hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. The MALDI-TOF experiments were carried out by adding the Lα -amino acid solution (1.0 × 10 -3 mol/L, 100 μ L) into an iQ[7] solution (1.0 × 10 -4 mol/L, 1.0 mL). The solution concentration was about 1.0 × 10 -4 mol/L (Lα -amino acids -iQ[7] = 1:1).",
