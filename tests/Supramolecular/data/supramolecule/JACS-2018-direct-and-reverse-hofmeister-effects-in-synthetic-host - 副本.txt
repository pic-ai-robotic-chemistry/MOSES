ABSTRACT: A combination of 1H NMR spectroscopy, DLS,
and turbidity measurements reveal that polarizable anions
engender both the Hofmeister and reverse Hofmeister eﬀects
in positand 2. Host 2 possesses two principal and distinctly
diﬀerent binding sites: a “soft” nonpolar pocket and a “hard”
crown of ammonium cations. NMR spectroscopy reveals that
anion aﬃnity to both sites is comparable, with each site
showing characteristic selectivities. NMR spectroscopy also
reveals that anions competitively bind to the pocket and
induce the Hofmeister eﬀect in host−guest binding at very low
concentrations (∼2 mM). Furthermore, the suite of
techniques utilized demonstrates that anion binding to both
sites leads to charge attenuation, aggregation, and ﬁnally precipitation (the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect). Anion-induced
precipitation generally correlated with aﬃnity, and comparisons between the free host and its adamantane carboxylate (Ada-
CO2
−) complex reveals that the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect is attenuated by blocking anion binding/charge attenuation at the
nonpolar pocket.
■INTRODUCTION
In 1888, Franz Hofmeister observed that certain salts induced
proteins to precipitate while others caused proteins to become
more soluble.1 In the intervening years since, the Hofmeister
eﬀect and the attendant Hofmeister series of anions (Figure 1)
have been demonstrated across a wide range of molecules,
using over 40 diﬀerent physicochemical measurements.2
Historically, this phenomenon was attributed to salts changing
water structure and indirectly aﬀecting a cosolute,2,3 but this is
not now believed to be so.4 Rather, the major noncovalent
interactions contributing to the Hofmeister eﬀect appear to be
direct anion−cosolute interactions involving hydrogen bond
donors and nonpolar surfaces of the cosolute.5
Contrary to the above, in some instances the reverse
Hofmeister eﬀect is observed. This phenomenon pertains to
the situation whereby instead of increasing the solubility of
proteins, nominally salting-in salts actually reduce solubility and
induce precipitation. For proteins, this eﬀect is normally
observed at a pH lower than the isoelectric point (pI).
However, observations can be complex and puzzling. For
example, at pH 9.4 it has been shown that lysozyme (pI =
11.35) exhibits a direct Hofmeister eﬀect at high ionic strength
(≳300 mM) but the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect at low salt
concentrations.6 Regarding the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect,
current evidence points to the importance of Coulombic
interactions between certain anions and the cationic centers in a
protein, leading ultimately to charge neutralization and
precipitation.6,7 Tied to this, vibrational sum frequency
spectroscopic studies of solid surfaces, and monolayers of
protein, surfactant, and polymer, reveal that at low pH,
interfacial water structure follows the reverse Hofmeister
series.7c,8 Furthermore, a Poisson−Boltzmann model modiﬁed
with ion-speciﬁc potentials suggests it is an entropic
contribution by anions which engenders the eﬀect at low salt
concentrations, and an entropic contribution from the counter
cations that leads to the Hofmeister eﬀect at high salt
concentrations.9 These points noted, there are still countless
open questions regarding the precise balance of supramolecular
interactions responsible for the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect.10
To our knowledge, the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect has not
been expressly linked to the solubility of small molecules in
water. However, from our perspective these two phenomena
are one and the same. Thus, it is common knowledge that to
make an ammonium salt more water-soluble, the chloride (Cl−)
salt is formed, whereas if poor water solubility is desired (i.e.,
organic solvent solubility), the perchlorate (ClO4
−) salt might
be targeted. Small molecule chemists have been content with
this knowledge and have not investigated this phenomenon.
However, it seems that it is intimately related to the reverse
Hofmeister eﬀect and that the study of small molecule solubility
could lead to a new level of understanding of this phenomenon
that is diﬃcult to access using proteins. With this in mind, the
work presented here represents, to our best knowledge, the ﬁrst
attempt to systematically study the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect in
a supramolecular system.

Previously, we have demonstrated that in buﬀered water the
Hofmeister eﬀect is manifest11 in the binding of amphiphilic
guests to deep-cavity cavitand 1 (Figure 2).12 Octa-acid 1
possesses a nonpolar concavity that readily binds amphiphiles
to form the corresponding 1:1 host−guest complex;13 a fact
that makes it ideal for projects such as the Statistical
Assessment of the Modeling of Proteins and Ligands
(SAMPL), a community-wide prediction challenge to evaluate
computational methods for aﬃnity determinations in com-
puter-aided drug design.14 We have observed that amphiphile
binding to host 1 is attenuated by salting-in anions, i.e., that
there is the expected apparent weakening of the hydrophobic
eﬀect upon the addition of these salts. Importantly, we
determined that this is caused by competitive binding of
relatively large, polarizable anions to the nonpolar pocket.11b,d
Furthermore, we recently demonstrated using a combination of
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), quantum calculations,
and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that anion binding
to the pocket of 1 is enthalpically favorable and entropically
penalized and involves only partial desolvation of the anionic
guest.11a
Curiously, anion binding to the nonpolar pocket of 1 is itself
subject to the Hofmeister eﬀect.11c Thus, the aﬃnity of ClO4
−
for the pocket of 1 is enhanced in the presence of salting-out
anions, is attenuated by salting-in anions, and shows a
nonmonotonic relationship with salt concentration in the
presence of weakly salting-out anions such as chlorate (ClO3
−).
We determined that the enhanced binding induced by salting-
out salts arises from an “active” (binding) cation and an
“inactive” (nonbinding) anion. Thus, in the case of NaF,
pseudo-speciﬁc sodium binding to the carboxylates of the host
reduces its net negative charge and increased ClO4
−aﬃnity,
while the counter ﬂuoride (F−) acts purely as a spectator ion. In
contrast, the attenuation of ClO4
−aﬃnity with salts such as
NaSCN arises because pseudospeciﬁc binding of Na+ is weak
relative to the SCN−aﬃnity for the pocket that competes with
ClO4
−binding. However, in cases where the “activity” of cation
and anion are comparable, e.g., Na+ versus ClO3
−, the
attenuation and diminution eﬀects compete and a non-
monotonic relationship between Ka of ClO4
−binding and salt
concentration is observed.
In related work we recently reported15 the synthesis of water-
soluble, octacationic host 2 (positand, Figure 2) bearing eight
nonionizable trimethylammonium groups on its outer surface.
This signiﬁcant diﬀerence aside, hosts 1 and 2 possess identical
structures, and we hypothesized that positand 2 would not only
possess stronger binding of anions to its nonpolar cavity but
also could bind anions to its “crown” of four ammonium
cations in its pendent groups (Figure 2). Furthermore,
considering the high positive charge density, we surmised
that with additional pseudospeciﬁc association of anions to the
trimethylammonium groups, positand 2 might also demon-
strate the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect. Our studies described here
conﬁrm that this is the case; in buﬀered water host 2
demonstrates anion−nonpolar surface interactions fundamental
to the Hofmeister eﬀect, as well as a salting-out phenomenon
that follows the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To determine which anions bound to positand 2 in aqueous
solution, we used
1H NMR spectroscopy to screen 31
monovalent sodium salts in unbuﬀered water. This screening
led us to select a total of 14 anions for binding constant (Ka)
determinations (Table 1). To determine the aﬃnity for the
crown of four pendent trimethylammonium groups (Ka
crown), we
used the shift of Hj (Figure 2) to the complex of positand 2
with adamantane carboxylate (Ada-CO2
−, Ka ≈7.21 × 106 M−1
by ITC) blocking the pocket. Only in the case of
trichloroacetate (CCl3CO2
−) was this strategy unsuccessful.
This anion was found to bind so strongly to the cavity (7.03 ×
104 M−1 by ITC) that it competed eﬀectively with the
adamantyl guest. The data from the Ka
crown determinations were
then used to ﬁt a 1:2 model for anion binding to the free host.
By this approach, monitoring Hb (Figure 2) allowed the
determination of the anion aﬃnity for the nonpolar cavity (Ka
cav,
Figures S33−S35 in Supporting Information). The NMR data

from hexaﬂuorophosphate (PF6
−) did not ﬁt this model well,
indicating that pseudospeciﬁc binding to the ammonium
groups was signiﬁcant. Additionally, only limited data for the
binding of triﬂate (CF3SO3
−) could be collected because of
peak coincidence of the Hb and benzyl signals of the host. In
both cases a minimum Ka value is quoted.
The nonpolar cavity of host 2 is primarily composed of eight
aromatic rings, has four weak hydrogen bond donors near its
base (Hb), and possesses a “soft” positive electrostatic potential
(remote charge groups). The switch from negative (1) to
positive electrostatic potential (2) means that all anions
observed to bind to 1 bind more strongly to host 2. Neither
F−nor Cl−showed evidence of complexation; however the
mid-Hofmeister series anions bromide (Br−), and nitrate
(NO3
−) did. For example, NO3
−bound with an aﬃnity of
ΔG = 2.7 kcal mol−1. Neither Br−nor NO3
−has an aﬃnity for
1.
More “hydrophobic” anions bound more strongly still. For
example, ClO4
−aﬃnity for 2 is ΔG = 5.0 kcal mol−1 (cf. 3.0
kcal mol−1 for host 1), while the aﬃnity of perrhenate (ReO4
−)
for the pocket was measured to be ΔG = 5.3 kcal mol−1. Strong
pseudospeciﬁc binding of PF6
−led to a poor ﬁt of data for
pocket binding. However, a plot of the Ka values for the binding
of small inorganic anions to host 1, against the corresponding
aﬃnities for 2, is approximately linear (R2 = 0.90) and projects
an aﬃnity for PF6
−to the cavity of 2 of Ka
cav ≃16 000 M−1 (ΔG
= 5.7 kcal mol−1). Thus, switching from a net negative (1) to a
net positive electrostatic potential (2) increases aﬃnity by ∼1.5
to 2.3 kcal mol−1, with smaller anions showing the larger
increase. These results demonstrate that a range of anions bind
to the pocket of 2, with aﬃnities ranging from 1.7 to 5.7 kcal
mol−1. Furthermore, the diﬀuse nature of the electrostatic
potential and the nonpolar surfaces of the pocket results in a
selectivity for large polarizable anions, with species such as
ReO4
−, PF6
−, and CCl3CO2
−possessing the strongest aﬃnities.
The downﬁeld shift of the Hb signal induced by anion
binding indicates that the ions are bound to the base of the
cavity of 2. In silico studies with 111a reveal that when bound
this way, anions remain solvated on their “portal side”. This
picture is consistent with related data. For example Br−has a
solvation shell of ∼6.5 waters and a hydration free energy of
ΔGhyd ≈77 kcal mol−1.16 This is too high to be compensated
for by noncovalent interactions with the host. Therefore, only a
fraction of the ﬁrst hydration shell is lost upon binding.
Additionally, the fact that polarizable anions accumulate at the
surface of water clusters17 and the fact that the stabilization of
bound water inside free 1 relies heavily on hydrogen bonding to
the bulk18 both support the idea that the “upper” half of the
anion and pocket are fully solvated. Furthermore, as the host

pocket can contain up to 7 waters,18 approximately half of the
solvation shell of Br−must be removed upon binding.
Anion aﬃnity for the nonpolar cavity induces the salting-in
Hofmeister eﬀect observed with host 1 at relatively low salt
concentrations (10−100 mM).11 The stronger anion aﬃnities
for positand 2 mean that the apparent weakening of the
hydrophobic eﬀect can be observed at much lower salt
concentrations. For example, titrating a 0.5 mM solution of
1:1 complex of 2 and 4-Me-benzoate (ΔG = −6.2 kcal mol−1 by
ITC) with NaReO4 results in 50% displacement of the guest at
a salt concentration of only 2 mM. Of course, for guests that
bind more strongly to 2, e.g., Ada-CO2
−(ΔG = −9.3 kcal
mol−1), the anion aﬃnity must be relatively extreme to observe
competition at relatively low salt concentrations. Hence, only in
the case of CCl3CO2
−is there an apparent weakening of the
hydrophobic eﬀect and guest displacement (vide supra). That
the Hofmeister eﬀect is evident at such low salt concentrations
relative to those typically used in protein work (1−10 M) is due
to three factors: (1) the relatively simple structures of these
hosts eliminates competing/countering eﬀects, (2) the
preorganized nature of the hosts enhances anion aﬃnity, and
(3) the use of noncoordinating anions19 (to use the language of
organometallic chemists) as strongly coordinating anions in
water ensures strong binding (Figure 1).
The Ka
crown values for the anions are also listed in Table 1.
The crown diﬀers qualitatively from the cavity by allowing
direct ion−ion interactions; the ammonium groups engender a
more intense electrostatic potential ﬁeld in the binding site. F−
did not bind to the crown, but the other halides did (ΔG = 2.8,
3.9, and 4.8 kcal mol−1 for Cl−, Br−, and iodide (I−),
respectively). I−aﬃnity was only slightly weaker than that of
the strongest binding guest PF6
−. These results lead to a
surprising and important conclusion: overall binding to the
crown and cavity is quantitatively comparable. For anion
recognition in water,20 the assumption has been that strong
Coulombic attractions and hydrogen bonding are needed to
counter ion solvation. If very tight binding is required, this most
likely holds true. However, host 2 demonstrates that anion
binding to a “soft”, charge-diﬀuse pocket can be as strong as
binding to a “hard” tetracationic binding site.
Figure 3 compares anion aﬃnity for the crown and cavity
ordered by decreasing aﬃnity for the crown. Cl−binds
exclusively to the crown, while CCl3CO2
−and CHCl2CO2
−
bind exclusively in the cavity. Between these extremes, speciﬁc
Ka
crown:Ka
cav ratios lie between 44:1 (Br−) and 1:4 (ReO4
−). It is
interesting to consider “non-coordinating” ClO4
−, with its next
generation isostere tetraﬂuoroborate (BF4
−). Although fre-
quently treated as interchangeable, they have very diﬀerent
aﬃnity preferences in water: Ka
crown:Ka
cav for BF4
−is 34:1, and
for ClO4
−it is 1:1.8. Because BF4
−and ClO4
−have similar
volumes (V = 50 and 51 nm3, respectively) and free energies of
hydration (ΔGhyd = 48 and 51 kcal mol−1, respectively), these
selectivities demonstrate that it is the nature of their partially
hydrated states, rather than the naked anion, that dictates their
aﬃnities for the two diﬀerent sites. Finally, for its relatively
strong aﬃnity to the crown, I−has a surprisingly low aﬃnity for
the cavity (Ka
crown:Ka
cav = 3.4:1). Interestingly, ClO4
−and I−are
often adjacent in the Hofmeister series, but Figure 3 shows that
they have essentially the opposite preferences when given the
choice of binding to the “soft” and “hard” sites of positand 2.
Again, we believe that it is the nature of the hydrated anion that
engenders these diﬀerences in binding. More generally, it is

collecting each set of data was kept constant to ensure continuity across diﬀerent salts.

clear there are multiple competing factors speciﬁc to each anion
that need to be taken into account.
Overall, Cl−, NO3
−, Br−, BF4
−, and I−have a preference for
the crown, whereas CF3SO3
−, thiocyanate (SCN−), cyanobor-
ohydride (BH3CN−), ReO4
−, ClO4
−, and PF6
−have a
preference for the nonpolar cavity. However, there is no clear
relationship between these preferences and the (limited)
available physical properties of the anions. Thus, although the
larger anions tend to prefer the pocket, smaller SCN−
preferentially binds to the pocket while larger BF4
−and I−
prefer the crown. That noted, the strongest correlation we
observed (R2 = 0.83) was between ΔG of crown binding and
one measure of ion hydration number (Figure S73).16b These
results highlight that in order to understand the Hofmeister
series, it is necessary to determine the supramolecular proﬁle of
each anion: How many waters can it readily lose from its
hydration shell? What are the preferred symmetry groups of
these hydrated clusters? Given a range of diﬀerent binding sites,
what are the aﬃnity preferences of each anion?
In contrast to host 1, many of these binding anions induce
aggregation of 2 at higher concentrations. To investigate this
further, we utilized dynamic light scattering (DLS) to examine
solutions of the host at diﬀerent salt concentrations. Figure 4
shows the eﬀects of the halides. Host 2 is monodispersed across
all concentrations of NaF and NaCl. However, a degree of
aggregation is observed with NaBr, with the observed
hydrodynamic diameter increasing from 2.2 nm (monomer)
to 3.0 nm (dimer) at 200 mM NaBr. In contrast, the diﬀerence
between Br−and I−is relatively extreme. Precipitation is
observed at 140 mM NaI, but substantial aggregation is
observed well below this level; at 12 mM NaI (6 equiv) dimers
dominate, while at 78 mM the measured particle diameter
corresponds to a ∼23-mer aggregate. In combination with the
NMR spectroscopy studies, these results show how the more
poorly hydrated I−(ΔGhyd values for F−, Cl−, Br−, and I−are
respectively 113, 83, 77, and 59 kcal mol−1)16b binds with the
host, attenuates the charge groups at the “top” (cavity) and
“bottom”(crown) faces of the host, and therefore induces
aggregation.
Overall, for those anions resulting in host aggregation and
eventual precipitation, the concentration at which very large
sizes (⌀> 1000 nm) were observed by DLS showed a reverse
Hofmeister ordering: CF3SO3
−< PF6
−< ReO4
−< ClO4
−<
BH3CN−< BF4
−< SCN−< CCl3CO2
−< I−(Table 2). To
examine this further, we also compared the particle size and
aggregation of the host to the complex with Ada-CO2
−. In the
complex the adamantane moiety prevents anion binding to the
pocket, while the strongly solvated carboxylate of the guest
helps ensure this face of the host is relatively hydrophilic. We
therefore envisioned that aggregation would be attenuated. This
was hard to quantify accurately with DLS because in each case
aggregation of the complex was attenuated until a sudden,
stepwise precipitation occurred (Figure S77). Evidently,
however, the kinetics of aggregation of the free host and the
complex are markedly diﬀerent.
To better quantify the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect in the host
and host−guest complex, we turned to solution phase turbidity
measurements21 using a 96-well format assay (Figures S41−
S44). Table 2 lists the obtained critical precipitation
concentration (CPC) values, along with those derived from
DLS data. The results are in close agreement, with the
diﬀerences attributed to the diﬀerent concentrations/ionic
strengths required for each experiment.
The CPC values from the turbidity assay ranged from 110
mM in the case of CCl3CO2
−to 4 mM in the case of PF6
−, with
the order of precipitating strength again tracking the reverse
Hofmeister series: PF6
−> CF3SO3
−∼ReO4
−> ClO4
−>
BH3CN−> BF4
−> SCN−> I−> CCl3CO2
−. With one
noticeable exception, the ion ordering for the corresponding
Ada-CO2
−complex was the same to that of the free host. Thus,
CF3SO3
−was a much poorer precipitator of the complex than
the free host (5th versus second best). Additionally, CCl3CO2
−
failed to precipitate the complex. We attribute these changes in
CPC to the importance of cavity binding for these guests.
Between these two anions, CF3SO3
−is the better precipitator of
the free host because it has aﬃnity for two faces (cavity and
crown), whereas CCl3CO2
−has no measurable aﬃnity for the
crown and so cannot easily induce aggregation along this
direction. With the complex, however, these anions have little
or no residency time at the cavity site. This means that
CF3SO3
−can only weakly (Table 1) induce aggregation at the
crown face, while CCl3CO2
−loses its only principle charge
neutralization site and so does not induce precipitation.

A graph of anion aﬃnity to the cavity and crown (Ka
cavand
Ka
crown) against the reciprocal of the CPC value of host 2
(Figure S69) shows that there is a stronger correlation with Ka
cav
(R2 = 0.84, versus 0.39 for Ka
crown). One other noteworthy
correlation was that between the partial molar entropy for the
aqueous ions and the CPC of 2 and its complex (both R2 =
0.96, Figure S72). Care is warranted here however. First,
entropy data are only available for ﬁve anions.16b More
fundamentally, partial molar entropies are generally obtained
by standard electrode potentials reliant on classical models
(extended Debye−Hückel theory and Poisson−Boltzmann
distribution) to describe ionic proﬁles near the electrode
surface. Such measurements cannot by their nature account for
the types of ion speciﬁcity observed here.22

physical data, but three similarly sized tetrahedral anions,

respectively), are revealing. These anions have free energies
of hydration: ΔGhyd = 80.8, 51.1, and 48 M−1, respectively, and
it might be expected that these free energy values correlate with
their corresponding aﬃnities. However, this is not the case: Ka
cav
= 7200, 4300, and 35 M−1 and Ka
crown = 1800, 2400, and 1200
M−1, respectively. Again, this poor correlation is most certainly
rooted in the fact that each anion is solvated diﬀerently and
each hydrated species responds diﬀerently to the pocket or
crown. Furthermore, these same three anions demonstrated
CPC values of 9.4, 12, and 35 mM, respectively. So while these
weakly correlate with the sum of Ka
cav and Ka
crown, they are not
directly linked to ΔGhyd.
We also examined the induction-delayed precipitation of the
same salts over a one-week period, with salt concentrations 50−
95% of the CPC. As anticipated, only those salts with deﬁned
CPC values induced precipitation. In all cases precipitation by
each salt was found to be dependent on both the nature and
concentration of the anion. Figure 5 shows representative
examples covering the gamut of response of host 2 to three
anions: CF3SO3
−, CCl3CO2
−, and PF6
−. In the broadest of
terms the salts can be classiﬁed as those inducing precipitation
at concentrations well below the CPC (Figure 5a and Figure
5b) and those salts that induced precipitation over a narrow
concentration range close to the CPC (Figure 5c). The former
include CF3SO3
−, CCl3CO2
−, and SCN−, while the latter are
PF6
−, ReO4
−, ClO4
−, BH3CN−, BF4
−, and I−. Overall, anions
induced precipitation over an increasingly narrow concen-
tration range in the order CF3SO3
−> CCl3CO2
−, > SCN−> I−
∼BF4
−∼BH3CN−> ReO4
−∼ClO4
−∼PF6
−.
There was no obvious correlation between these data and the
CPC values for each salt. Thus, the anions precipitating over a
wide range of concentration cover the range of CPC values, 9.2,
63, and 110 mM, as did those that induced slow precipitation
over a narrow concentration range. Similarly, there was no
evident correlation between the induction-delayed precipitation
data and Ka
cav and Ka
crown. Considering the multiple mechanisms
of precipitation that are possible, this is perhaps not surprising,
but it is a reminder that this most obvious manifestation of the
reverse Hofmeister eﬀect may not be the ideal probe for
detailed investigation of the phenomenon.
In the case of 2 complexed with Ada-CO2
−, only CF3SO3
−
(5th best precipitator) and PF6
−(1st precipitator) induced
precipitation below the CPC value; the other salts did not. As
with the DLS and CPC data for 2 and its complex, we attribute
this to the latter possessing a strongly solvated anionic center
(R−CO2
−) at the portal of the cavity turning oﬀaggregation
pathways involving this face of the host. Only PF6
−, CF3SO3
−,
and CCl3CO2
−bind strongly enough to the pocket to compete
with the guest and potentially open up this face to aggregation,
but as CCl3CO2
−(worst precipitator) has no aﬃnity for the
crown, displacement of the guest still only leaves one major
aggregation route. Hence it too fails to induce precipitation
under the conditions employed.
■CONCLUSIONS
A combination of approaches reveal that even relatively simple
host 2 possesses complex Hofmeister and reverse Hofmeister
properties. Positand 2 possesses two principal, distinctly
diﬀerent binding sites: a “soft” polarizable pocket and a
“hard” crown of trimethylammonium groups (Figure 2).
Importantly, anion aﬃnity for the two sites is quantitatively
comparable (Table 1). However, each site is qualitatively quite
distinct, with anion selectivities that are not always self-evident.
Anion binding to the cavity of 2 results in competitive
exchange with amphiphiles and hence the apparent reduction in
the hydrophobic eﬀect typical of the normal Hofmeister eﬀect.
Concomitantly, binding of polarizable anions to either crown or
cavity induces the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect by charge
attenuation and a decrease in the hydrophilicity of the face of
the host that the binding site occupies. In general terms,
increased anion aﬃnity correlates with increased ability to
induce aggregation. However, because of a multitude of
reasons, there is no simple relationship between anion aﬃnity
and the resulting CPC value of free host 2 or its complex with
adamantane carboxylate (Ada-CO2
−). That stated, the diﬀer-
ences in the series of CPC values for host and host−guest

complex are revealing; for the complex, the reverse Hofmeister
eﬀect induced by anions that selectively bind to the cavity of 2
is attenuated or disappears entirely. Thus, the binding of a high-
aﬃnity guest with a strongly solvated carboxylate group
maintains strong solvation of what otherwise would be a
major aggregation face of the host. Likewise, a carboxylate-
induced switching-oﬀor reduction in the residency time of a
polarizable anion in the cavity also aﬀects the slow precipitation
of host 2.
These results demonstrate several key points. First, because
anion aﬃnity for soft and hard binding sites is comparable and
because anion aﬃnity for both types of sites can induce the
normal and reverse Hofmeister eﬀects, these eﬀects are
frequently competing. Second, it is almost certainly the case
that the reverse Hofmeister eﬀect in proteins is based not only
on direct anion−cation binding but also on relatively “soft” sites
quite remote from any charge group. Third, given suﬃcient
understanding of the properties of a solute, the reverse
Hofmeister eﬀect can be attenuated or turned oﬀby blocking
select anion-binding sites. Finally, except in the simplest of
systems, using CPC values or analogous macroscale phenom-
ena is unlikely to lead to an improved understanding of the
reverse Hofmeister eﬀect. Rather, the focus must be on
qualifying and quantify ion recognition sites in a molecule or
biomacromolecule. Hence, one of the key, long-term endeavors
for supramolecular chemistry is to understand the supra-
molecular proﬁles of inorganic anions. Further studies into the
reverse Hofmeister eﬀect are ongoing.
