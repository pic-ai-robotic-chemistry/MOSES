Rational design of supramolecular self-assembly sensor for living cell
imaging of HDAC1 and its application in high-throughput screening
A B S T R A C T
Supramolecular chemistry offers new insights in bioimaging, but specific tracking of enzyme in living cells via
supramolecular host-guest reporter pair remains challenging, largely due to the interference caused by the
complex cellular environment on the binding between analytes and hosts. Here, by exploiting the principle of
supramolecular tandem assay (STA) and the classic host-guest reporter pair (p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4A)
and lucigenin (LCG)) and rationally designing artificial peptide library to screen sequence with high affinity of
the target enzyme, we developed a “turn-on” fluorescent sensing system for intracellular imaging of histone
deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), which is a potential therapeutic target for various diseases, including cancer, neurological, and cardiovascular diseases. Based on computational simulations and experimental validations, we
verified that the deacetylated peptide by HDAC1 competed LCG, freeing it from the SC4A causing fluorescence
increase. Enzyme kinetics experiments were further conducted to prove that this assay could detect HDAC1
specifically with high sensitivity (the LOD value is 0.015 μg/mL, ten times lower than the published method).
This system was further applied for high-throughput screening of HDAC1 inhibitors over a natural compound
library containing 147 compounds, resulting in the identification of a novel HDAC1 down-regulator (Ginsenoside
RK3). Our results demonstrated the sensitivity and robustness of the assay system towards HDAC1. It should
serve as a valuable tool for biochemical studies and drug screening.


1. Introduction
Post-translational modification (PTM) is an important modality to
regulate protein functions in biological systems. ε-Amino acetylation of
lysine residues in proteins is a PTM that impacts DNA transcription,
replication, and protein-protein interactions by modifying protein
structure (Falkenberg and Johnstone, 2014). This PTM pattern is mainly
regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Till now, 18 human HDACs have been identified
and divided into four classes based on their sequence homology
(McClure et al., 2018). Class I HDACs, particularly HDACs 1, 2 and 3, are
overexpressed in tumors and play crucial roles in regulating gene
expression related to carcinogenesis (Arrowsmith et al., 2012). Among
them, HDAC1 also abnormally upregulated in various other diseases,
such as neurological disorders, immune disorders (Falkenberg and
Johnstone, 2014) and cardiovascular diseases (Herr et al., 2018; Li et al.,
2020). Activity tracking assays are vital for studying biological mechanisms, enzymatic deacetylation regulation and screening novel
HDAC1-targeting inhibitors from compound libraries, which is crucial in
the fields of biology, medicine and pharmacy. Fluorescent sensors are
ideal for enzyme activity tracking due to their high sensitivity,
non-destructive measurement and imaging capabilities, surpassing other biochemical methods like radioisotopes, antibodies, HPLC, mass
spectrometry and electrochemical analyzers (Hu et al., 2020; Moreno-Yruela et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2017). Up to date, a lot of fluorescent sensors have been developed for HDACs (Tan and Li, 2022; Tang
et al., 2022), but few realized HDACs imaging with selectivity for HDAC
isoforms (Liu et al., 2018, 2022). Zhang et al. reported a fluorescent
probe with great selectivity towards Class I HDACs (Zhang et al., 2021),
but it may result in background fluorescence from non-specifically
bound or excessive probes and precluding real-time intracellular
HDAC activity detection because it was designed by tagging a fluorophore to HDAC-isoform selective inhibitors. Furthermore, the
cumbersome synthesis of these probes limits their widespread use. Till
now, there is no fluorescent sensors has been designed for imaging of
HDAC1 in living cells. Developing selective HDAC1 fluorescent
biosensor for high-throughput screening and live cell imaging still remains a great challenging.
The design of substrates with high affinity and selectivity for HDAC1
is the basis for achieving selective detection of HDAC1. As a protein
modification enzyme, the natural substrate of HDAC1 is proteins with
ε-Amino acetylation of lysine residues. Peptides, as amino acid oligomers with the same building blocks as proteins, can potentially replace
proteins. Peptides also have higher stability and are easier to synthesize
and modify than proteins, making them very suitable as enzyme-specific
substrates for designing enzyme sensors (Liu et al., 2015). Specific
peptide sequences with high affinity for HDAC1 can be obtained by
optimizing and screening artificial peptide libraries. Researches on
constructing fluorescent enzyme sensors using peptide substrates
(Placzek et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2020) often employs
the covalent linking method to conjugate the peptide substrate with a
signal marker, which often involves complex synthesis, purification and
structure identification processes. Supramolecular tandem assay (STA)
based on the principles of supramolecular chemistry (Hennig et al.,
2007) provides a label-free strategy for using peptides as enzyme
recognition component and then achieving fluorescence signal transformation. STA utilizes fluorescent dyes for sensitive and convenient
signal transduction, introduces enzymes to achieve specific recognition
of analytes, and employs macrocycles to distinguish enzymatic reaction
substrates and products (Umali and Anslyn, 2010), enabling real-time
monitoring of enzymatic reactions because of the dissociation or binding of the macrocyclic host and guest running much faster than enzymatic reaction (Nau et al., 2009). Till now, many enzyme assays based
on host-guest interaction have been established (Nilam and Hennig,
2022), but examples of intracellular enzyme imaging based on STA are
still rare because of the following reasons: 1) Incomplete complexation
of the reporter pair may induce background noise (You et al., 2015) and
some established STA systems even exhibit “switch-off” fluorescence
change after enzymatic reaction (Liu et al., 2019; Yue et al., 2019; Zhao
et al., 2020). 2) The complex cellular environment may interfere with
the binding between the target analyte, such as enzyme products, and
the host, thus affecting the transduction of the fluorescence signal.
Therefore, implementing the STA strategy in the cellular environment,
may need 1) select a reporter pair with high-affinity, which do not
exhibit fluorescence enhancement in the presence of substrate alone,
and show strong fluorescence enhancement when introduced enzymes;
2) optimize the selectivity of the substrate for the enzyme and the affinity differences between substrate/product for the artificial host.
In our manuscript, we first rationally constructed a peptide library
for optimizing high-affinity peptide candidates of HDAC1. Based on the
structural characteristics of the peptide sequence after deacetylation by
HDAC1, we selected SC4A as a supramolecular host because it can form
complexes with cationic amino acids (Arena et al., 2006) and peptides
(McGovern et al., 2014). LCG was then selected as indicator due to its
high quantum yield and strong affinity to SC4A, showing significant
fluorescence quenching upon complexation with SC4A (Guo et al.,
2011). Afterwards, the candidate peptides were screened to obtain the
sequence with sufficiently high affinity for SC4A and sufficiently low
affinity between its corresponding acetylated peptide and SC4A, ultimately constructing a product-selective “switch-on” STA sensor suitable
for selective imaging of HDAC1 in living cells. As shown in Scheme 1,
SC4A encapsulated LCG is non-emissive even in the presence of
Ac-peptide due to photo-induced electron transfer (PET). HDAC1 catalyzed the deacetylation of the weak competitor Ac-peptide to continuously form a strong competitor peptide displacing LCG from SC4A,
which results in a significant increase in fluorescence intensity. Moreover, this approach is effectively applied to living cells. Specifically, this
sensor was incubated with cells， causing endogenous HDAC1 deacetylate substrates and produce products displacing LCG from SC4A. It also
displays great potential in the high throughput screening of HDAC
inhibitors.


2. Experimental section
2.1. Optimization of Ac-peptides binding to LCG-SC4A supramolecular
system
500 μM Ac-peptides were incubated with 50 μg/mL HDAC1 in 10
mM HEPES buffer (pH = 8.0) at 37 ◦C for 2 h. The samples and standard
samples (Ac-peptides and peptides) were then analyzed by HPLC.
Deacetylation rate of each Ac-peptide was calculated using the following
equation:
Deacetylation rate (%) = [(P0 − PS) / P0] × 100%
(P0: the peak area of Ac-peptide before deacetylation; PS: the peak area
of Ac-peptide after deacetylation).
Then competitive titrations were performed in HEPES buffer (10
mM, pH 8.0) at room temperature to determine the association constant
(Ka) between SC4A and peptides. The direct fluorescence data from the
competitive titrations were fitted in a nonlinear manner (http://www.
jacobs-university.de/ses/wnau).
2.2. Fluorescence measurement
To optimize assay conditions, HDAC1 (0.5 μg/mL) and LCG/SC4A (2
μM/4 μM) were first incubated with Ac-peptide 14 (50 μM) in HEPES
buffer with different concentrations, then incubated with Ac-peptide 14
(50 μM) in 5 mM HEPES of different pH value, and then incubated with
different concentrations of Ac-peptide 14 in 5 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0.
To test the sensitivity of this assay, 2 μM/4 μM LCG/SC4A and 50 μM
Ac-peptide 14 was incubated with different concentrations of HDAC1,
recording fluorescent intensity at the interval of 120 s until the fluorescence intensity approximately stable.
To determine the Km value of Ac-peptide 14 towards HDAC1, 2 μM/4
μM LCG/SC4A and 0.5 μg/mL HDAC1 was incubated with different
concentrations of Ac-peptide 14, recording fluorescent intensity at the
interval of 120 s until the fluorescence intensity approximately stable.
To determine the IC50 value of HDAC inhibitors, HDAC1 and this
sensor were incubated with different concentration of Vorinostat
(SAHA) and Entinostat (MS-275).
To test the detection selectivity, this sensor was also incubated with
other macromolecules (50 μg/mL) and histone deacetylases (5 μg/mL),
and the fluorescence measurements were taken after 3 h incubation.
All the fluorescence intensity was recorded by TECAN infinite
M1000 Multi-function microplate reader (λex = 368 nm, λem = 505 nm)
after incubation for 3 h at 37 ◦C. 2.3. Living cell imaging with Ac-peptide based supramolecular sensor
All cell imaging experiments were carried out on ImageXpress®
Micro Confocal system (Molecular Devices). Cells were seeded in 96-
well black plate with clear bottom (Grenier 655,090) at an appropriate density and allowed to attach to the plate for 12 h in growthmedium at 37 ◦C with 5% CO2. All wells were divided into three groups
and reagents were added as shown below: 1) LCG 25 μM, 2) LCG/SC4A
25/250 μM and 3) LCG/SC4A/Ac-peptide14 25/250/300 μM. Fluorescence images were taken by ImageXpress Micro Confocal system (Molecular devices) after 3 h incubation with nine images acquired from
each independent well for fluorescent intensity analysis. Excitation and
emission wavelength:488 nm and 525 nm for LCG; 405 nm and 450 nm
for Hoechst. The fluorescence intensity was calculated with MetaXpress
PowerCore software (Molecular devices).
2.4. High-throughput screening method
The HEK293T cells were seeded in 96-well black plates with clear
bottom at a density of 8000/well. After the cells adhered to the plate for
12 h, compounds were pre-administered for 12 h. The old culture medium was then removed and stained with LCG/SC4A/Ac-peptide 14
(25/250/300 μM). The cell fluorescent images were obtained and
analyzed with the same methods mentioned in the living cell imaging
section. The inhibition rate of drugs on HDAC1 was calculated by
[(I0–I)/I0] × 100% (I0: the average fluorescence intensity of green
fluorescence per cell in control group; I: the average fluorescence intensity of green fluorescence per cell in administration group).


3. Results and discussion
3.1. Rationally design of Ac-peptide-based supramolecular sensor for
HDAC1 detection
In this work, in order to realize HDAC1 selectivity, a candidate library of 175 Acetylated-lysine-centered 5-mer peptides were first constructed for substrate peptide screening by knowledge- and mechanismbased design (Fig. 1A), which is composed of deacetylation sites regulated by HDAC1 as reported previously (Li et al., 2014; Nalawansha and
Pflum, 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021) and the
highly-correlated amino acids with lysine acetylation at four randomized positions (Schwartz et al., 2009) to screened peptide candidates
with high affinity of HDAC1. As mentioned in Section 1, the
complexation-induced quenching reporter pair, SC4A⋅LCG, which was
applied for monitoring cellular uptake of specific analytes (Nguyen and
Anslyn, 2006), has been selected for established STA sensor. To employ
STA sensing HDAC1 in living cells, we also need: 1) minimize the
interference of other cellular substances on the complexation between
the product and the host; 2) lower the fluorescence as much as possible
when HDAC1 was inhibited or knock down in live cells. Therefore, the
candidate sequences need to be further optimized to achieve sufficiently
high affinity between the peptide and SC4A and sufficiently low affinity
between the corresponding acetylated-peptide and SC4A.
First, instead of measuring the deacetylation rates of all 175 acetylated peptides one by one, we randomly selected 14 acetylated peptides
(Ac-peptides) to test their deacetylation rates of HDAC1 by HPLC
methods. Five Ac-peptides (Ac-peptide11,7,5,12 and 14) showed more han 70% efficacy when incubated with HDAC1 (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the
structure-activity relationship revealed that topological polarity surface
area (TPSA) (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.6173) contributed
significantly to the deacetylation capability (Fig. S15). Molecular
docking showed that the Ac-peptide 14 with the highest affinity of
HDAC1 occupied the enzyme active site by the key interactions of
several hydrogen bond between this peptide and the residues of Gln-26,
Asp-99, Gly-149, Asn-95. Moreover, the lysine to the right of the acetylation site in Ac-peptide14 is inserted into another cavity at the rim of
the active site further enhancing the binding affinities (Fig. S16), which
indicated that the binding affinity between other amino residues in Acpeptides and HDAC1 could crucially affect the catalytic efficiency
because the central-acetylated-lysine remained unchanged.
The association constant (Ka) between SC4A and LCG was in
consistent with previous study (Guo et al., 2011), which fitted as (4.6 ±
0.4) × 106 M− 1 in 10 mM HEPES at pH = 8.0 (Fig. S17 B). To obtain a
pair of peptides (Ac-peptide and its product peptide) from 5 pairs of
candidate peptides with the largest binding difference to SC4A,
competitive titrations were performed to determine the Ka values between these candidate peptides and SC4A, which were used to quantify
the binding affinity between analytes and macrocyclic receptors. The
fold changes of Ka values between peptides and their corresponding
Ac-peptides were subsequently calculated to demonstrate the disparity
in binding affinities between substrates and products to the supramolecular host (Fig. 1C). Finally, Ac-peptide 14 was selected as the substrate to develop a STA assay for HDAC1 detection, for its highest
deacetylation rate of HDAC1, sufficiently high affinity of its product for
SC4A and the largest contrast in the binding of this peptide and its
product to SC4A.
Given the results of substrate optimization, we next performed
experiment to verificate the accessibility of this sensor to HDAC1. As
shown in Fig. 2A, the addition of HDAC1 to LCG/SC4A system caused
only a little fluorescence recovery. This implies that the enzyme itself
does not interfere with the reporter pair, thus eliminating the need for
additional processing steps in the actual detection process, unlike previous studies (Yu et al., 2021). However, the addition of HDAC1 to LCG/SC4A/Ac-peptide 14 system caused a significant fluorescence
enhancement, indicating HDAC1 triggered LCG displacing from SC4A.
HPLC results also confirmed the enzymatic response of Ac-peptide 14
under this condition, which showed more than half of Ac-peptide 14 was
deacetylated after co-incubation with HDAC1 for 60 min at this condition (Fig. 2B).
Computational simulations were performed to further confirm the
feasibility of this sensor in detecting HDAC1. Firstly, LCG was quenched
due to photo-induced electron transfer (PET) when binding to SC4A. As
shown in Fig. 2C, the photoexcitation/de-excitation process from S0 to
S1 is primarily controlled by transitions from HOMO/HOMO-1 to
LUMO/LUMO+1 in LCG monomers and the HOMO/HOMO-1 (− 6.758
eV) and LUMO/LUMO-1 (approximately − 3.4 eV) orbitals are degenerate due to the symmetrical structure of LCG. These frontier molecular
orbitals exhibit conjugation throughout the entire fluorophore, facilitating π-π* transitions that result in bright fluorescence in LCG monomers. Several occupied molecular orbitals of SC4A are positioned
between the HOMO and LUMO levels of LCG. The energy levels of these
frontier molecular orbitals are consistent with the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) mechanism (Biedermann and Schneider, 2016)
(Fig. 2C). Based on this fluorescence quenching mechanism, then the
results of binding energy(BE) calculations followed the increasing order
of SC4A⋅Ac-peptide14 (1.317 eV) < SC4A⋅LCG (1.604 eV) <
SC4A⋅peptide14 (1.761 eV). The amide group in Ac-peptide 14 was
transformed into an ammonium group (which is protonated under
physiological pH conditions) with the HDAC enzyme, form two additional hydrogen bond donating sites in this ammonium group, which
greatly enhance the stability of SC4A⋅peptide14. Owing to this large BE,
peptide 14 could thus effectively displace LCG from SC4A and then
realized HDAC1 tracking.


3.2. The sensitivity and specificity of Ac-peptide-based supramolecular
sensor towards HDAC1
Considering that the above results demonstrated the feasibility of the
sensor for sensing HDAC1, we further investigated the sensitivity and
selectivity of this assay. According to previous studies (Yue et al., 2019;
Zheng et al., 2021), the enzymatic reaction rate is directly proportional
to the enzyme concentration when the substrate is in excess. Therefore,
we co-incubated different concentrations of HDAC1 with
LCG/SC4A/Ac-peptide14 and recorded the fluorescence intensity over
time to determine the initial velocity of the enzyme reaction by calculating the slope of the enzyme kinetics curve, which was further used to
calculate the limit of detection (LOD) value. This sensing assay worked
as expected with the fluorescence intensity of the sensing system gradually increasing during 3 h in the presence of various HDAC1 concentrations (Fig. 3A) and the LOD value was calculated as 0.015 μg/mL
(Fig. 3B) according to the function(LOD = 3.3 δ/S) mentioned in previous study (Zhao et al., 2020). It’s much lower than the LOD value of
a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe published before, which is 2.93
nM equivalent to 0.208 μg/mL(Shu et al., 2022). A further investigation
revealed that the Km value was 24.95 μM for the Ac-peptide 14 toward
HDAC1 (Fig. 3C and D) and is much lower than that 152.61 μM of
HDAC2 (Fig. S21), which has high homology with HDAC1 (Kr¨ amer,
2023). Futhermore, the feasibility of this sensing system in screening
inhibitors was confirmed by determining the IC50 value of pan-inhibitor
Vorinostat (SAHA) and specific HDAC1/HDAC3 inhibitor Entinostat
(MS-275) (Fig. 3E and F). The IC50 values were respectively measured as
0.05138 and 0.7131 μM, close to the values reported in the literatures
(Choi et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2021). The sensor also demonstrated
excellent selectivity towards HDAC1 compared with other biological
macromolecules and enzymes(Fig. 3G). All these results confirmed this
sensor could precisely sense HDAC1 and facilate inhibor screening in
vitro.


3.3. Ac-peptide-based supramolecular-sensor enabled sensing HDAC1
activity in living cells
We further applied the sensor for tracking HDAC1 in the HEK293T
cells. The negligible cytotoxicity of LCG, SC4A, and Ac-peptide 14 was
first verificated (Fig. S23). Strong fluorescence signals were observed
when the HEK293T cells were only treated with LCG, indicating that
HEK293T cells can uptake LCG. In contrast, HEK293T cells remained
dark when co-incubated with LCG and 10 × SC4A (Fig. S24). These
results indicated SC4A quenching fluorescence of LCG in living cells.
After co-incubating LCG/SC4A and the Ac-peptide 14 with the HEK293T
cells, a bright fluorescence was observed, indicating the displacement of
LCG from SC4A inside cells (Fig. 4A). To further confirm that the
displacement of LCG from SC4A was triggered by HDAC1, we performed
cell inhibition study with MS-275. An approximate 2-fold decrease of
fluorescence intensity is observed for MS275-treated cells compared
with normal cells (Fig. 4A and S25), suggesting that HDAC1 could
trigger Ac-peptide 14 deacetylation into peptide 14, thus displacing LCG
from SC4A. This sensor was also applied in the H9c2 and the Hela cells
(Fig. S26). Futhermore, siRNA knockdown experiments with HEK293T
cells showed that fluorescence diminished when HDAC1 was knocked
down (Fig. 4B). All of the above results strongly demonstrated the
sensing assay enables intracellular HDAC1 imaging.
3.4. Ac-peptide based-supramolecular sensor facilitated the highthroughput screening for HDAC inhibitors in living cell imaging manner
Inhibition of HDACs has demonstrated therapeutic potential in diseases including cancer, neurological diseases, immune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. While some HDAC inhibitors like Vorinostat,
Romidepsin, and Belinostat have been approved for treating certain
types of lymphoma (Duvic et al., 2007; Molife and de Bono, 2011;
VanderMolen et al., 2011), their lack of specific inhibitory effects may
lead to unpredictable side effects. As a result, the search for lead compounds specifically targeting histone deacetylase isoforms has gained
momentum. Natural product libraries are considered valuable resources
for screening potential lead compounds.
A high-throughput screening pipeline in HDAC1 inhibitor screening
over a natural product library containing 147 compounds using
ImageXpress® Micro Confocal system (Molecular Devices) was constracted with this Ac-peptide-based supramolecular sensor. Most of the
compounds exhibited weak or no inhibitory effects of HDAC1(Table S3
and Fig. 5B). Five of the top 11 compounds with high inhibitory activity,
i.e. Honokiol (Singh et al., 2013), 20(S)-Ginsenoside CK (Kang et al.,
2013), Chrysophanol (Lu et al., 2017), Emodin (Ha et al., 2011) and
Luteolin (Attoub et al., 2011) have been previously reported to
down-regulated HDAC1 protein levels or inhibit HDAC activity
(Table S2). Among the unreported hits, Salvianic acid A (SAA) could
significantly inhibit HDAC1 activity (Fig. S27), while protocatechuic
acid (PCA) and Ginsenoside Rk3 could significantly down-regulated
celluar protien level (Fig. 5C). However, it is crucial to identify
pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) in high throughput
screening (Baell and Walters, 2014), as some hits could nonspecifically
bind to multiple proteins and interfere the screening results. Among our
hits, emodin and chrysophanol are quinone, while Luteolin, protocatechuic acid and Salvianic acid A are catechol, which may act as covalent modifier, redox cycler, or metal complexer resulting in false
positive outcomes. We verified whether the unreported PCA and SAA are
PAINS by assessing binding directly with Cellular Thermal Shift Assay
(CETSA). As shown in Fig. S29, they couldn’t protect HDAC1 protein
from temperature-dependent degradation in temperature- and
dose-dependent CETSA assays, indicating their inhibitory effect does not
depend on a specific, drug-like interaction between the molecule and the
protein. Whereas CETSA assays showed Ginsenoside Rk3 could bind
HDAC1 directly and down-regulated protein level (Fig. 5D and E). As
shown in Fig. S30, the mRNA level and protein degradation results
futher indicated that Ginsenoside Rk3 may down-regulate protein levels
by increasing protein degradation.


4. Conclusions
In conclusion, by exploiting supramolecular tandem assay and the
LCG⋅SC4A reporter pair and rationally screening for high-affinity acetylated peptide of HDAC1, we have developed a novel and straightforward label-free sensing system (LCG⋅SC4A reporter pair and Ac-peptide
14(AKK(Ac)RH)). Based on computational simulation and experimental
verification, we demonstrated that the proposed system enables specifically detect HDAC1 with high sensitivity in and outside live cells, offering advantages such as simplicity and avoidance of complex
synthesis. We successfully conducted a high-throughput screening of
HDAC inhibitors over a natural compounds library comprising 147
compounds by exploiting a high-content imaging system, identified a
novel HDAC1 down-regulator (Ginsenoside RK3), indicating its great
potential in drug screening. For the present assay, there is still a distance
from spatially locating HDACs in live cells and realizing imaging HDACs
in vivo. Future work could include integrating the STA sensing system
with other strategies such as nano aggregates and rotaxane to enhance
binding efficiency, minimize interference in more complex environments and realize spatially locating HDACs in vivo.
