CONSPECTUS: Proteins exhibit high-binding affinity and
selectivity, as well as remarkable catalytic performance. Their
binding pockets are hydrophobic but also contain polar and
charged groups to contribute to the binding of polar organic
molecules in aqueous solution. In the past decades, the synthesis of
biomimetic receptors featuring sizable aromatic cavities equipped
with converging polar groups has received considerable attention.
“Temple” cages, naphthotubes, and aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles
are privileged examples of synthetic scaffolds displaying function-
alized hydrophobic cavities capable of binding polar substrates. In
particular, calix[4]pyrroles are macrocycles containing four pyrrole
rings connected through their pyrrolic 2- and 5-positions by tetra-
substituted sp3 carbon atoms (meso-substituents). In 1996, Sessler
introduced the meso-octamethyl calix[4]pyrrole as an outstanding receptor for anion binding. Independently, Sessler and Floriani
also showed that the introduction of aryl substituents in the meso-positions produced aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles as a mixture of
configurational isomers. In addition, aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles bearing two and four meso-aryl substituents (walls) were
reported. The cone conformation of “two-wall” αα-aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles features an aromatic cleft with a polar binding site
defined by four converging pyrrole NHs. On the other hand, “four-wall” αααα-calix[4]pyrrole isomers possess a deep polar aromatic
cavity closed at one end by the converging pyrrole NHs. Because of their functionalized interior, aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles are
capable of binding anions, ion-pairs, and electron-rich neutral molecules in organic solvents. However, in water, they are restricted to
the inclusion of neutral polar guests.
Since the early 2000s, our research group has been involved in the design and synthesis of “two-wall” and “four-wall” aryl-extended
calix[4]pyrroles and their derivatives, such as aryl-extended calix[4]pyrrole cavitands and super aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles. In this
Account, we mainly summarize our own results on the binding of charged and neutral polar guests with these macrocyclic receptors
in organic solvents and in water. We also describe the applications of calix[4]pyrrole derivatives in the sensing of creatinine, the
facilitated transmembrane transport of anions and amino acids, and the monofunctionalization of bis-isonitriles. Moreover, we
explain the use of calix[4]pyrrole receptors as model systems for the quantification of anion−π interactions and the hydrophobic
effect. Finally, we discuss the self-assembly of dimeric capsules and unimolecular metallo-cages based on calix[4]pyrrole scaffolds.
We comment on their binding properties, as well as on those of bis-calix[4]pyrroles having a fully covalent structure.
In molecular recognition, aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles and their derivatives are considered valuable receptors owing to their ability
to interact with a wide variety of electron-rich, neutral, and charged guests. Calix[4]pyrrole scaffolds have also been applied in the
development of molecular sensors, ionophores, transmembrane carriers, supramolecular protecting groups and molecular containers
modulating chemical reactivity, among others. We believe that the design of new calix[4]pyrrole receptors and the investigation of
their binding properties may lead to promising applications in many research areas, such as supramolecular catalysis, chemical
biology and materials science. We hope that this Account will serve to spread the knowledge of the supramolecular chemistry of
calix[4]pyrroles among supramolecular and nonsupramolecular chemists alike.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the past decades, molecular recognition using macrocyclic
receptors has attracted considerable interest in supramolecular
chemistry.5 Synthetic macrocycles aim to mimic the remarkable
properties exhibited by biological receptors.6,7 They are
synthesized by combining aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic
components. Some macrocycles possess internal cavities capable
of surrounding the surface of the bound guest. Macrocyclic
receptors have been used to investigate noncovalent interactions
in solution.8 They have also found applications in molecular
sensing,9 liquid−liquid extraction,10 transmembrane trans-
port,11 reactivity modulation,12 and catalysis,13 among
others.14,15
Many macrocyclic receptors, i.e., calix[4]arene, resorcin[4]-
arene, pillar[4]arene, cucurbit[n]uril, etc., feature aromatic
cavities not functionalized with converging polar groups, which
limits their use in binding processes exclusively relying on size
and shape complementarity. High-affinity and selective binding
of charged and neutral polar guests demands equipping the
receptor’s cavity with complementary functional/polar groups.
Nevertheless, the synthesis of receptors possessing function-
alized aromatic/hydrophobic cavities represents a challenging
endeavor.16,17 We and others used calix[4]pyrrole (C[4]P)
scaffolds to address the issue of functional complementarity for
the binding of polar substrates.
In 1886, Baeyer18 reported the acid-catalyzed condensation of
pyrrole with acetone to afford meso-octamethyl C[4]P 1 (Figure
1a). After being ignored for many years, 1 was reintroduced by
Sessler as a privileged receptor for the binding of anions,19 ion-
pairs,20,21 and neutral polar molecules.22 In nonpolar solvents, 1
preferentially adopts 1,2- and 1,3-alternate conformations. The
addition of a coordinating anion induces the switching of 1 into
the cone conformation owing to the establishment of four
convergent hydrogen bonds with the bound anion (Figure 1b).
In addition, and mainly in nonpolar chlorinated solvents, 1 acts
as ion-pair receptor in the complexation of cesium, imidazolium
and alkylammonium salts of coordinating anions. The cation is
included in the shallow and electron-rich aromatic cavity defined
by the pyrrole rings of 1 in cone conformation. This cavity is
opposite to the bound anion, and the included cation
experiences favorable Coulombic, cation−π and CH−π
interactions. This binding geometry is referred as receptor-
separated ion-paired complex.23
The substitution of two opposite meso-methyl groups in 1 by
phenyl substituents provided “two-wall” aryl-extended calix[4]-
pyrroles (AE-C[4]Ps) (Figure 1c).24 Analogously, the replace-
ment of a methyl group in each one of the meso-carbons of 1
afforded “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps (Figure 1d).25,26 The synthesis
of “two-wall” AE-C[4]Ps involves two acid-mediated con-
densation reactions. First, the condensation of a methyl aryl
ketone with pyrrole, used as solvent, affords a dipyrromethane.
Second, the cyclocondensation of the obtained dipyrromethane
with acetone, also used as solvent, gives the “two-wall” AE-C[4]
P as a mixture of two configurational isomers: αβ and αα,
depending on the relative orientation of the two meso-aryl

substituents. For the same token, the direct acid-mediated
cyclocondensation reaction of a methyl aryl ketone with pyrrole,
in an organic solvent, produces crudes of “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps
containing up to four isomers: αβαβ, ααββ, αααβ, and αααα
(or tetra-α). On the one hand, the cone conformation of the
“four-wall” tetra-α isomer displays a deep aromatic cavity open
at one end and equipped with a polar binding site at the closed
end (Figure 1f). The tetra-α isomer is usually obtained in 5−
20% yield in the cyclocondensation reaction, with some
exceptions (e.g., >35% yield when using either meta- or para-
hydroxyphenyl methyl ketones).25,27 On the other hand, the
cone conformation of the “two-wall” αα-isomer, which is usually
produced in 5−30% yield upon the cyclocondensation step,
presents an aromatic cleft with a polar binding site (Figure 1e).
In both cases, the polar binding site is defined by four converging
pyrrole NHs. The aromatic cavities/clefts of AE-C[4]Ps can be
further elaborated by placing substituents at their upper rims.1−3
In addition, the meso-carbons of AE-C[4]Ps can bear alkyl
substituents instead of methyl groups. For example, the
cyclocondensation reaction to give “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps
bearing meso-alkyl substituents with terminal functional groups
often fails or produces the tetra-α isomer in low yield (ca. 1%).28
Nevertheless, the use of methyltrialkylammonium chloride salts
as templates enhances the macrocyclization reaction and favors
the formation of the tetra-α isomer (up to 62% yield).29 It is
worth mentioning that the reaction conditions of the cyclo-
condensation in “two-wall” and “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps lack of
generality. They are dependent on the alkyl aryl ketone, acid and
solvent used. Moreover, the macrocyclization reaction might
suffer, in some cases, from low reproducibility.30,31
Over the last 15 years, our research group focused on the
design and synthesis of AE-C[4]P receptors for the selective and
efficient binding of anions, ion-pairs, and neutral polar
molecules. In this Account, we discuss the binding properties
of “two-wall” and “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps and their derivatives,
such as AE-C[4]P cavitands and super aryl-extended C[4]Ps
(SAE-C[4]Ps).32 We also describe their applications in
molecular sensing, facilitated transmembrane transport, and
modulation of chemical reactivity. Moreover, we demonstrate
their use as model systems for the quantification of noncovalent
interactions. Finally, we describe selected examples of bis-C[4]P
receptors based on covalent and self-assembled structures
(dimeric capsules), as well as metallo-cages containing one C[4]
P unit. We do not dwell in photoswitchable or mechanically
interlocked receptors in this Account.
2. “TWO-WALL” ARYL-EXTENDED CALIX[4]PYRROLES
2.1. Anion Binding
“Two-wall” αα-AE-C[4]Ps bind mono- and polyatomic anions
through the establishment of four convergent hydrogen bonds
between the pyrrole NHs and the anion.24 Concomitantly, the
receptor adopts the cone conformation sandwiching the anion
between the two aromatic walls. This binding geometry forces
the bound anion to directly interact with the π-systems of the
meso-aryl substituents.33
Taking advantage of the above binding geometry, we
employed a series of “two-wall” AE-C[4]Ps, 2a−g (Figure 2a),
to determine the energetic contribution of anion−π interactions
to the thermodynamic stability of their complexes with halides.1
The meso-aryl substituents of 2a−g were decorated with
electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups to tune
their electronic characteristics. In acetonitrile, 2a−g formed 1:1
anionic complexes (Figure 2b) with Cl−, Br−, and I−(added as
tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts). The association constants
of the complexes (Ka) were determined using
1H NMR
spectroscopic titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) experiments (Table 1).

For any given receptor, the trend of thermodynamic stabilities
of the complexes showed the order Cl−> Br−> I−. This was due
to the importance of electrostatic effects in charged hydrogen-
bonding interactions. In addition, the binding affinities
displayed by the receptors’ series for a particular halide were
dependent on the electronic properties of the meso-aryl
substituents. For example, the Ka value determined for
Cl−⊂2g was 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of Cl−⊂2a.
Moreover, only Cl−⊂2f−g were kinetically stable on the
chemical shift time scale. This finding hinted at their superior
thermodynamic stabilities.
We dissected the free energy component corresponding to the
anion−π interactions by (a) considering that the contribution
provided by the charged hydrogen-bonding interactions was
constant in all complexes and (b) adjusting this value to the free
energy calculated for X−⊂1. The free energies calculated for the
anion−π interactions were obtained using the formula:
ΔΔGhalide−π = (ΔGX
−
⊂2 −ΔGX
−
⊂1)/2, the coefficient of 2
considers the presence of two aromatic walls and assumes that
anion−π interactions are additive. The obtained ΔΔGhalide−π
values displayed a linear relationship with the calculated
molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) at the center of the
aryl rings (Figure 2c). This result demonstrated that anion−π
interactions became more favorable as the MEP value of the aryl
ring turned more positive. For example, the interaction of Cl−
and Br−with 1,3-dinitrobenzene was ca. −0.7 kcal·mol−1. The
interactions increased to −1.0 kcal·mol−1 in the case of I−,
probably, due to the larger polarizability of this anion. The
observed linear relationships demonstrated that the studied
anion−π interactions were dominated by electrostatic effects.
2.2. Anion Transport
In collaboration with Matile, we investigated the strength of the
anion−π interactions of NO3
−using 2b and 2e−g.34 We also
evaluated the transmembrane transport of anions facilitated by
2b and 2e−g. In acetonitrile, the 1:1 anionic complexes of NO3
−
featured Ka values in the range of 10−103 M−1 (Table 1) and
experienced fast exchange binding dynamics on the chemical
shift time scale. The X-ray structure of NO3
−⊂2g showed that
only one of the oxygen atoms of the anion was hydrogen-bonded
to the four pyrrole NHs of the receptor (Figure 3a). The bound
NO3
−was located almost perpendicular to the meso-aryl
substituents of 2g establishing anion−π interactions. For an
alternative X-ray structure, see refs 34 and 35.
We explored the facilitated anion transport activity of 2b and
2e−g using large unilamellar vesicles composed of egg yolk
phosphatidylcholine (EYPC). The transport process was
monitored using the 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonate
(HPTS) assay in HEPES buffered NaCl solution (pH 7.0).
The obtained results indicated that 2e and 2g were the most
active carriers in the transmembrane transport of NO3
−
featuring EC50 values (i.e., effective concentration needed to
reach 50% activity) of 8.4 and 2.0 nM, respectively. In addition,
2e and 2g displayed an excellent selectivity for the transport of
NO3
−over other anions (Figure 3b,c). Notably, the transport
activities of 2e and 2g were independent of the cation used in the
experiments, suggesting that they operated via an anion/anion
antiport mechanism.
3. “FOUR-WALL” ARYL-EXTENDED
CALIX[4]PYRROLES
3.1. Anion Binding
The “four-wall” αααα-AE-C[4]Ps are also capable of binding
anions through the formation of four convergent hydrogen
bonds.25 Consequently, the bound anion is surrounded by the
four meso-aryl substituents of the receptor in cone conformation,
leading to the establishment of multiple anion−π interactions.33
We prepared a series of “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps, 3a−f (Figure
4a), and investigated the effect of chloride−π interactions on
anion binding.36 As before, the aromatic walls of 3a−f were
functionalized with different para-substituents in order to
modify their electronic properties. We probed that, in
acetonitrile, the binding of Cl−to 3a−f led to the formation of
Cl−⊂3a−f inclusion complexes (Figure 4b). In addition, all the
complexes were kinetically stable on the chemical shift time
scale. We determined that the Ka values of the complexes were in
the range of 102−105 M−1 (Table 2). The magnitude of the Ka
value was sensitive to the electronic nature of the meso-aryl
substituents in 3a−f.
Using an analogous methodology to that described above for
the “two-wall” counterparts, we calculated the binding energy
deriving from the chloride−π interactions in Cl−⊂3a−f. The
free energies assigned to the chloride−π interactions, ΔΔGCl
−
−π
= (ΔGCl
−
⊂3 −ΔGCl
−
⊂1)/4, correlated well with the Hammet
constants of the receptors’ para-substituents (Figure 4c). The
calculated energy values showed that the chloride−π interaction
was repulsive for Cl−⊂3a−e, whereas it was slightly attractive for
Cl−⊂3f. These results also supported the conclusion that the
chloride−π interaction was dominated by electrostatics. Note

acetonitrile. However, Gale showed that ester and amide
derivatives of 3g selectively bound F−in dimethyl sulfoxide.37
3.2. Molecular Recognition in Water
The synthesis of water-soluble “four-wall” αααα-AE-C[4]Ps
requires the incorporation of ionizable or charged groups at
either the upper or lower rims.5 Their cone conformation
displays a polar binding site buried in a deep hydrophobic cavity,
which is suitable for the binding of neutral polar molecules in
water. The included guest is stabilized by the hydrophobic effect
(HE), hydrogen-bonding, π−π, and CH−π interactions.
In 2009, we reported the first examples of water-soluble “four-
wall” AE-C[4]Ps bearing terminal carboxylic acid and amino
groups at the upper rim, 4a−b (Figure 5a).38 Both compounds
were soluble in water (pH ∼7). We also studied the
complexation of the pyridyl N-oxides 5a and 5e (Figure 5b)
with 4a−b at pH ∼7 using
1H NMR and UV−vis
spectroscopies. The AE-C[4]Ps, [4a-4H]4−and [4b+4H]4+,
formed thermodynamically and kinetically highly stable 1:1
inclusion complexes with 5a and 5e (Figure 5c). Although the
receptors had an overall opposite charge, they displayed similar
binding constants with the same guest (Table 3). On the
contrary, the fact that the complexes of 5e were 1 order of
magnitude less stable than those of 5a suggested the existence of
steric clashes between the water-solubilizing groups and the
para-phenyl substituent of 5e. Alternatively, the inclusion of 5e
could have a negative effect in the solvation of the ionized
terminal groups.
In this respect, we placed the water-solubilizing groups at the
lower rim in 4c (Figure 5a).28 On the one hand, the binding
constants were similar for the complexes of 5a with both [4a-
4H]4−and [4c-4H]4−(Table 3). On the other hand, 5e⊂[4c-
4H]4−was 2 orders of magnitude more stable than 5e⊂[4a-
4H]4−.
Recently, we demonstrated that “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps also
bound cyclic and acyclic monoamides, such as 6 and 7 (Figure
5b and Table 3).39,40 For example, 4d4+ formed a thermody-
namically highly stable 1:1 inclusion complex with 6. In
addition, 4e4+ selectively bound cis-7 with high-binding affinity.
This conformational selectivity was remarkable owing to the
existence of free 7 in a 32:68 cis/trans-isomeric ratio. The
binding of neutral polar guests to the polar hydrophobic cavity of
water-soluble AE-C[4]Ps at room temperature (r.t.) was mainly

istic of the so-called “non-classical” HE.5
4. ARYL-EXTENDED CALIX[4]PYRROLE CAVITANDS
We use the term “cavitand” in the case of “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps
featuring, at least, two adjacent meso-aryl substituents bridged.
For binding studies of ion-pairs with phosphonate cavitands, see
refs 41 and 42.
4.1. Recognition and Sensing of Creatinine
In 2016, we introduced the monophosphonate cavitand 8a for
the selective and high-affinity binding of creatinine 9a (Figure
6a).27 The concentration of creatinine in urine and plasma is a
clinical biomarker of kidney performance and renal function,
among others. By performing solid−liquid extraction experi-
ments, we demonstrated that 8a extracted 1 equiv of the
insoluble creatinine 9a into dichloromethane. The cavitand 8a
included 9a in its polar aromatic cavity leading to the formation
of 9a⊂8a. The X-ray structure of 9a⊂8a showed that the bound
creatinine established five hydrogen bonds with the cavitand
(Figure 6b): four with the pyrrole NHs and one with the
inwardly directed PO group. The methylene protons of 9a
were involved in CH−π interactions with two meso-aryl
substituents. Based on the solubility of 9a (<10−5 M) and the
quantitative formation of 9a⊂8a, we estimated a Ka > 107 M−1.
The PO group of 8a played an important role in the binding of
9a. In acetone, the monophosphonate cavitand 8a extracted 0.4
equiv of 9a, whereas the bis-methylene derivative 8b did not
extract 9a, at least, at millimolar concentrations. Subsequently,
we incorporated 8a in the sensing membrane of an ion-selective
electrode (ISE). The cavitand 8a increased the sensitivity and
selectivity of the ISE toward the detection of the creatininium
cation, [9a+H]+, in aqueous buffer solution and in bodily fluids.
Recently, we developed an indicator displacement assay
(IDA) for hexyl creatinine 9b using the monophosphonate
cavitand 8c, bearing a dansyl chromophore at the upper rim, and
the pyridyl N-oxide 10 as quencher (Figure 6a).3 The synthesis

of 8c involved four reaction steps starting from the tetra-hydroxy
AE-C[4]P 11 (Figure 6c). First, the nucleophilic aromatic
substitution of 1,2-difluoro-4-nitrobenzene with 11 afforded the
monoaryl-bridged intermediate 12. Next, the monophospho-
nate mononitro cavitand 13 was obtained by reacting 12 with
phenylphosphonic dichloride. Finally, the catalytic hydro-
genation of 13, followed by the coupling with dansyl chloride
gave the monophosphonate cavitand 8c. The inclusion of 10 in
the cavity of 8c led to the formation of 10⊂8c (Ka = 1.2 × 107
M−1) and the quenching of the fluorescence of the dansyl
chromophore by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
(Figure 7a,b). Next, the incremental addition of 9b to the
solution of 10⊂8c induced the displacement of 10 to the bulk
solution and the formation of 9b⊂8c (Ka = 4.5 × 105 M−1).
Accordingly, the competitive displacement of 10 by 9b
produced a fluorescence turn-on of the supramolecular sensor
(Figure 7c). Similar results were obtained with 9a.
4.2. Amino Acid Transport
We demonstrated that 8a was also able to extract L-Pro into
dichloromethane owing to the formation of a 1:1 inclusion
complex (Ka > 106 M−1) (Figure 8a).43 Based on this result, we
applied 8a as a molecular carrier to facilitate the transport of
amino acids across liposomal and human HeLa cell membranes.
Using a radiometric assay and [3H]-radiolabeled amino acids,
we observed that 8a facilitated the transport of L-Pro across
liposomal membranes (0.1% carrier/EYPC) in HEPES buffer
(pH 7.4) (Figure 8b). In addition, 8a displayed a remarkable
selectivity for the facilitated transport of L-Pro over other amino
acids (Figure 8c). In human HeLa cell membranes, 8a,
embedded in the membrane of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) liposomes (10% carrier/
POPC), contributed to the cellular uptake of
L-Pro, in
combination with that mediated by the natural transporters.
5. SUPER ARYL-EXTENDED CALIX[4]PYRROLES
We introduced “four-wall” αααα-SAE-C[4]Ps in 2016.44 Their
synthesis involved the attachment of para-ethynyl-aryl sub-
stituents at the upper rim of “four-wall” αααα-AE-C[4]Ps. In
cone conformation, SAE-C[4]Ps feature a deeper and more
hydrophobic aromatic cavity than the parent AE-C[4]Ps.

5.1. Quantification of the Hydrophobic Effect
In water, the HE is mainly responsible of the high-binding
affinities shown by biological and synthetic supramolecular
complexes.5 Polar interactions provide binding selectivity. In
this sense, we assessed the HE exerted by the inclusion of
nonpolar residues in the aromatic/hydrophobic cavity of water-
soluble SAE-C[4]Ps.
We prepared two SAE-C[4]Ps, 14a−b (Figure 9a), bearing
eight ionizable or charged groups placed at the terminal
positions of the four meso-aryl and the four meso-alkyl
substituents.2 Briefly, the quadruple Sonogashira cross-coupling
reactions of the tetra-iodo AE-C[4]Ps 15a−b with the para-
ethynyl-aryl compounds 16a−b afforded the octa-ester and the
octa-chloro SAE-C[4]Ps 17a−b. The octa-ester 17a was
hydrolyzed with LiOH, obtaining the octa-acid derivative 14a.
In turn, the octa-pyridinium 14b was prepared by heating the
parent octa-chloro 17b in pyridine. In water, 14a was soluble at
pH ∼10, whereas 14b was soluble at any pH. Both SAE-C[4]Ps,
[14a-8H]8−and 14b8+, displayed sharp and well-defined proton
signals in the bound form, i.e., when locked in cone
conformation. Next, we determined the binding constants of
14a−b with a series of pyridyl N-oxides, having a nonpolar para-
substituent, 5b−e (Figure 5b). Both SAE-C[4]Ps formed 1:1
inclusion complexes with the guests. The pair of complexes with
the same guest featured similar Ka values and followed the order
5b < 5c < 5d < 5e (Table 3). These results indicated that the
increase in the surface area of the para-substituent translated
into a gain in binding affinity.
Considering that the interaction of the pyridyl N-oxide
residue was constant throughout the guests’ series and using 5a
as a reference, we calculated the binding energy, ΔΔG, derived
from the inclusion of the nonpolar para-substituent of 5b−e in
the cavity of [14a-8H]8−and 14b8+. For each receptor, the
calculated energy values displayed a linear relationship with the
surface area of the para-substituents (Figure 9c). In these model
systems, the HE was determined to be 33−38 cal·mol−1·Å−2.
Although the surface areas of the para-substituents of 5d−e were
similar, the complexes of 5e were stabilized by an additional 2
kcal·mol−1, possibly, owing to the formation of multiple
aromatic interactions at the upper rim of the SAE-C[4]Ps
(Figure 9b).
5.2. Monofunctionalization of Aliphatic Bis-isonitriles
The monofunctionalization of symmetric difunctional com-
pounds having independent reacting groups yields statistical
mixtures of products. Among others, macrocyclic receptors have
been used to improve the reaction selectivity toward the
monofunctionalized product.12 For example, the acid-catalyzed
hydrolysis of aliphatic bis-isonitriles 18a−c yields statistical
mixtures containing starting materials, monoformamides 19a−c
and bis-formamides 20a−c (Figure 10a). Based on our previous
knowledge on the binding of formamides to AE-C[4]Ps,39 we
addressed the monofunctionalization problem of 18a−c using
14b.4
First, we characterized the 1:1 inclusion complexes of 14b8+
with 18−20 in water. For instance, the complexes of the guests
having five methylene spacer groups featured Ka (18b⊂14b8+) =
1.3 × 105 M−1, Kapp (19b⊂14b8+) = 6.9 × 105 M−1 and Kapp
(20b⊂14b8+) = 9.2 × 105 M−1 at 313 K. The alkyl chain of the
included guests adopted a fully extended conformation. The
nonsymmetric guest 19b, once included within 14b8+, displayed
the cis-formamide end bound to the C[4]P unit, whereas the
isonitrile end was placed close to the open rim of the receptor
(Figure 10b). Next, we studied the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, at
313 K, of 18a−c (Figure 10c). In the absence of 14b8+, the
reaction yielded 19a−c in a maximum amount of 50% after 20
min. Considering two irreversible reactions, we calculated k1 =
7.0 × 10−2 min−1 and k2 = 3.5 × 10−2 min−1. In contrast, in the
presence of 1 equiv of 14b8+, the reaction yielded a mixture of
nonstatistical composition and displayed a decrease in reaction
rates. For the bis-isonitrile 18b, the monohydrolyzed product
19b reached a maximum amount of 80% after 2 h. The kinetic
data fit well to a model that considered two irreversible reactions
(k1 and k2) and the reversible formation of the three complexes
(Ka [18b⊂14b8+], Kapp [19b⊂14b8+], and Kapp [20b⊂14b8+]).

This result demonstrated that 14b8+ functioned as both, a
sequestering and supramolecular protecting group, enhancing
the selectivity of the reaction for 19b.
For the shorter bis-isonitrile 18a, the selectivity for 19a was
reduced to 70% owing to the decrease in the thermodynamic
stability of 19a⊂14b8+. For the longer bis-isonitrile 18c, the
monoformamide 19c reached a maximum amount of 55%.
Although 18c/19c⊂14b8+ were thermodynamically highly
stable, one isonitrile group protruded into the water/receptor
interface.
6. COVALENT “TWO-WALL” BIS-CALIX[4]PYRROLES
6.1. Design and Synthesis
The covalent linkage of two αα-C[4]P units through their para-
positions provided “two-wall” bis-C[4]Ps. Two different
approaches are described in the literature for their syntheses.45
One of them consists on directly coupling two identical or not
αα-disubstituted C[4]Ps. Following this approach, we synthe-
sized 21a−b bearing 1,3-diynyl and 1,4-triazole linkers,
respectively (Figure 11).46,47 It is worth mentioning that the
efficient synthesis of 21b required the use of tetrabutylammo-
nium terephthalate as template. The other approach involves the
condensation of two identical bis-dipyrromethane units with
acetone.48,49
6.2. Anion Binding and Cooperative Effects
The bis-C[4]Ps 21a−b can bind simultaneously two ion-pairs
leading to the formation of 1:2 complexes.45 The influence of the
first guest binding, i.e., formation of a 1:1 complex (K1:1), on the
binding affinity for the second guest (K1:2) can be assessed using
the cooperativity factor: α = 4 × K1:2/K1:1. Based on this
relationship, a binding process of two ion-pairs can display
positive (α > 1), negative (α < 1), or no-cooperativity (α = 1).
We investigated the interaction of 21a with TBA+OCN−,
TBA +Cl −, and methyltrioctylammonium chloride
(MTOA+Cl−) in chloroform.50 For the TBA+ salts, 21a
established 1:2 cascade complexes featuring an included ion-
triplet in close-contact binding mode (Figure 12a). This binding
geometry produced a large positive cooperativity in the second
binding event (Table 4). In turn, the 1:2 complex of the MTOA+
salt featured a receptor-separated binding geometry for the two

trations vs time for the reaction of 18b in the absence/presence of 14b.

ion-pairs (Figure 12b). For this reason, the cooperativity factor
in (Cl−)2⊂21a·(MTOA+)2 was much lower than for the TBA+
salt.
We also assessed the binding cooperativity of the same ion-
pairs with 21b.47 Although the geometries of the 1:2 complexes
of 21b were identical with those described above for 21a, its
binding cooperativity was negative in the case of MTOA+Cl−
(possibly anion repulsion due to the smaller cavity) and null for
the TBA+ salts (inadequate size for sandwiching the cation
between the two bound anions).
7. DIMERIC CAPSULES ASSEMBLED FROM
“FOUR-WALL” CALIX[4]PYRROLES
“Four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps equipped with suitable functional
groups at their upper rims self-assemble into dimeric capsules
by establishing intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions.51
They are also used for the self-assembly of dynamic covalent
cages and capsules. These supramolecular architectures present
persistent polar cavities controlling the relative position and
orientation of the included guests.52
7.1. Hydrogen-Bonded Capsules
Sessler25 and Floriani26 reported the first examples of hydrogen-
bonded capsules assembled in the solid-state from 3g (Figure
4a). This AE-C[4]P also formed sodium and pH responsive
hydrogels in the presence of the tetramethylammonium cation
(TMA+).53 Subsequently and inspired by the works of Rebek54
and Böhmer,55,56 we investigated the dimerization of tetra-urea
22 (Figure 13a,b).57 In dichloromethane and in the presence of
0.5 equiv of 23a, 22 self-assembled quantitatively into a dimeric
capsule including one molecule of 23a (Ka > 108 M−2). The
encapsulated 23a established hydrogen bonds with the two polar
ends of (22)2. Moreover, the urea groups of (22)2 were
unidirectionally oriented and formed a cyclic array of 16
hydrogen bonds.
We also demonstrated the pairwise encapsulation of guests in
(22)2. For example, a 1:1 mixture of 22 and 23b self-assembled
quantitatively into (23b)2⊂(22)2.58 In addition, a 2:1:1 mixture
of 22, 23b, and MTOA+Cl−in chloroform produced exclusively
[(23b)(Cl−)]⊂(22)2·(MTOA+).59 The included 23b and Cl−
occupied the polar ends of (22)2 with a chloroform molecule
sandwiched between them.
7.2. Dynamic Covalent Capsules
We used dynamic covalent chemistry for the self-assembly of
tetra-aldehyde 24 in a capsular dimer (Figure 14).60 In
chloroform, the combination of 24 with 0.5 equiv of 25 induced
the quantitative self-assembly of 25⊂(24)2. In the complex, the
formyl groups of 24 established a cyclic array of 8 hydrogen
bonds and displayed a suitable arrangement for a subsequent

interhemisphere imine condensation reaction with selected
diamines. The addition of 4 equiv of 26 to the solution of
25⊂(24)2 afforded the octa-imine 25⊂27.
Recently, we assembled a tetra-imine cage by direct
condensation of 24 with a tetra-amine AE-C[4]P.61 In this
case, a templating guest was not required for the formation of the
cage in chloroform, yet the addition of 10% acetonitrile or 1
equiv of 23a increased the reaction yield.
8. UNIMOLECULAR METALLO-CAGES BASED ON
SUPER ARYL-EXTENDED CALIX[4]PYRROLES
8.1. Design and Self-Assembly
In order to preorganize SAE-C[4]Ps in cone conformation and
fully close their aromatic cavities, we studied the self-assembly of
coordination cages (CCs) using M(II) (M = Pd,Pt) metal
centers and SAE-C[4]Ps bearing four meta-pyridyl units at the
upper rim, 28a−b (Figure 15a).62,63 In 2:1 chloroform/
acetonitrile, 28a adopted the cone conformation by binding
an acetonitrile molecule. The addition of 1 equiv of [M-
(CH3CN)4](BF4)2, followed by thermal equilibration induced
the self-assembly of a monometallic CC, [28a·M]2+ (Figure
15b). The X-ray structure of [28a·Pd]2+ showed that the
coordination of Pd(II) provided an additional polar binding site
defined by four inwardly directed α-pyridyl protons. Two
encapsulated acetonitrile molecules filled the CC’s cavity and
complemented the hydrogen-bonding needs of the two opposed
polar binding sites.
We also attached four pyridinium residues at the lower rim in
28b.64 In the presence of suitable polar guests, 28b and Pd(II)
(added as NO3
−salt) self-assembled into a water-soluble CC,
[28b·Pd]6+. In water, the CC experienced significant aggrega-
tion at r.t., which was reduced by heating the solution at 333 K.
8.2. Encapsulation of Neutral Polar Guests
The CCs, [28a−b·M(II)], encapsulated mono- and ditopic
polar guests (Figure 16a−d).62−64 Monotopic guests were
bound to the binding site defined by the C[4]P unit and partially
filled the CC’s cavity. In these cases, the coencapsulation of an
acetonitrile or water molecule was mandatory. The solvent
molecule was hydrogen-bonded to the pyridyl α-CHs and
assisted in the ideal 55% filling of the cavity volume. In contrast,
ditopic guests complemented the hydrogen-bonding requests of
both binding sites and filled completely (55%) the CC’s cavity
volume.
In 2:1 chloroform/acetonitrile, the addition of 5a or 23a to
[28a·Pd]2+ led to the quantitative formation of [(CH3CN)-
(5a)]⊂[28a·Pd]2+ and 23a⊂[28a·Pd]2+, respectively.62 Sim-
ilarly, the addition of 29 to [28a·Pd]2+ produced [(CH3CN)-
(29)]⊂[28a·Pd]2+ (Ka = 5 × 103 M−1).63 In water, [28b·Pd]6+
also encapsulated 5a and 23a.64 Moreover, [28b·Pd]6+ showed
high-conformational selectivity by exclusively binding cis,cis-30
(Ka > 105 M−1).
9. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE
We reviewed our own results on the supramolecular chemistry
of AE-C[4]Ps and their derivatives. In solution, C[4]Ps were
shown to bind anions, ion-pairs, and neutral polar molecules.
The binding studies of halides with “two-wall” and “four-wall”
AE-C[4]Ps provided experimental energy values for gauging
anion−π interactions. The elaboration of the aromatic cavity of
“four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps afforded AE-C[4]P cavitands and SAE-
C[4]Ps. AE-C[4]Ps acted as carriers in the facilitated trans-
membrane transport of anions (“two-wall” AE-C[4]Ps) but also
of amino acids (cavitands). Monophosphonate cavitands were
also employed for the recognition and sensing of creatinine. The
placement of ionizable or charged groups at the periphery of
“four-wall” AE- and SAE-C[4]Ps enabled to study molecular
recognition processes in water. Water-soluble SAE-C[4]Ps were
used for the quantification of the HE and the monofunction-
alization reaction of bis-isonitriles. The upper rim elaboration of
AE- and SAE-C[4]Ps enabled the covalent construction of bis-
C[4]Ps and the self-assembly of dimeric capsules and
unimolecular metallo-cages.

Other authors implemented C[4]Ps in supramolecular14 and
covalent65,66 polymeric materials (anion capture) and in
therapeutics (potential anticancer drugs).15 In addition, “two-
wall” AE-C[4]Ps and cavit and derivatives described here might
find potential applications as therapeutic tools owing to their
transmembrane transport properties. Moreover, the functional-
ization of surfaces with AE-C[4]P derivatives might lead to the
development of sensors. However, the practical applications of
AE- and SAE-C[4]Ps require increasing the yields of the
macrocyclization reactions affording the AE-C[4]P scaffolds.
We hope that this Account will inspire researchers to develop
new constructs based on C[4]Ps and apply them in other
complementary areas, such as supramolecular catalysis, chemical
biology, and materials science.
