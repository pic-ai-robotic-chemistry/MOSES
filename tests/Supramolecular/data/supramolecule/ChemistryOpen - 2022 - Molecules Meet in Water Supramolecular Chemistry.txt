When Molecules Meet in Water-Recent Contributions of
Supramolecular Chemistry to the Understanding of
Molecular Recognition Processes in Water
ABSTRACT: Molecular recognition processes in water differ from those in
organic solvents in that they are mediated to a much greater
extent by solvent effects. The hydrophobic effect, for example,
causes molecules that only weakly interact in organic solvents
to stay together in water. Such water-mediated interactions can
be very efficient as demonstrated by many of the synthetic
receptors discussed in this review, some of which have
substrate affinities matching or even surpassing those of natural
binders. However, in spite of considerable success in designing
such receptors, not all factors determining their binding properties in water are fully understood. Existing concepts still provide
plausible explanations why the reorganization of water molecules often causes receptor-substrate interactions in water to
be strongly exothermic rather than entropically favored as
predicted by the classical view of the hydrophobic effect.


1. Introduction
Structurally and electronically complementary molecules that
meet in solution stay together for a while. An important
parameter determining the stability of complexes formed in
this way is the nature of the intermolecular interactions, with
strong ionic interactions potentially affording more stable
complexes than weaker types of interactions.[1] Although
deviations from this trend caused by effects such as
multivalency[2] or cooperativity[3–5] are possible, the intrinsic
strength of the primary interactions is generally considered to
be a decisive factor for the efficiency with which two or more
binding partners interact.
Another factor is the solvent in which complex formation
takes place.[6] Since all types of noncovalent interactions feature
a pronounced electrostatic component, complex stability
decreases as the relative permittivity of the solvent increases. In
addition, the solvation of the binding partners, especially that
of the interacting functional groups, leads to a further reduction
of complex stability since the energetic gain of complex
formation is partially offset by the energy required to remove
solvent molecules from the regions of the molecules that come
into contact. As a consequence, complexes that are stable in a
nonpolar environment can become almost nonexistent in a
polar solvent in which solvation is strong.
Based on these arguments, molecular recognition processes
in water, with its high permittivity and the pronounced hydrogen bond donor and acceptor properties of water molecules,[7,8]
should be particularly inefficient, which, in reality, is not the
case. Not only have certain synthetic receptors long been
known to work in water,[9] but the entire biochemical machinery, which relies heavily on noncovalent interactions between
the various biomolecules, functions (and has evolved) in this
solvent. Water can even mediate interactions between apolar
molecules that are not prone to interact in other environments
if the reorganization of the water molecules that accompanies
the association of the solutes is thermodynamically favorable.
Molecular recognition in water is thus intricately linked to the
peculiar properties of water molecules and water in the bulk.
Liquid water is highly cohesive, for example, as reflected in
its high melting and boiling points, its surface tension, and heat
capacity.[7,8] At the molecular level, these properties are due to
the extensive interactions between the water molecules in the
liquid state, each of which forms on average 3.6 hydrogen
bonds to its immediate neighbors.[10] The incorporation of a
solute into this network not only requires the formation of a
cavity, but also the rearrangement of a certain number of
hydrogen bonds. While new hydrogen bonds can potentially be
formed to a polar solute, accommodating an apolar solute in
the water matrix requires reorganizing hydrogen bonds to
compensate for bonds that are given up when forming the
cavity. Accordingly, the extent and outcome of the response of
the water network depend characteristically on the solute’s size,
polarity and shape.[11,12] Furthermore, the transition from the
state in which solutes are individually hydrated to the state in
which they form a complex is normally associated with the
release of water molecules, since the solvent-exposed surface
area of the complex is smaller than the sum of the surface areas
of the individual complex components. Thus, water molecules
are reincorporated into the water matrix during complex
formation with thermodynamic consequences that are much
more pronounced than those in other solvents. These watermediated binding processes are associated with the term
hydrophobic effect,[13,14] whereby a distinction is often made
between the classical and the nonclassical hydrophobic effect,
depending on whether complex formation is dominated by
entropy or enthalpy.[15]
For the understanding of recognition processes in water it is
therefore not sufficient to only focus on the binding partners;
one must also consider the effect of complex formation on the
solvent. Not all relevant principles are fully understood yet,[16]
although receptors are studied in water for many years.
Examples are cyclodextrins,[17,18] macrocyclic polyamines,[19–22]
and cucurbiturils.[23,24] Some aspects of supramolecular
chemistry in water are therefore known for some time,[9,25] but
with the increasing interest in developing receptors for practical
applications,[26–29] many of which require functioning systems in
water, the interest in deciphering the principles of molecular
recognition in water has grown considerably.
In this review, a number of recent developments are
highlighted with a particular focus on host-guest chemistry, while self-assembly in water will not be treated.[30,31] Emphasis is
placed on providing insight into current views on how the
hydration of the binding partners and the complex, as well as
the reorganization of water molecules during complex formation affect binding. The respective discussion will remain
qualitative, however, and readers interested in thorough
thermodynamic treatments of the respective aspects are
referred to more specialized reviews.[32,33] Receptors engaging in
coordinative interactions with the substrate are not considered
because the covalent nature of these interactions causes
complex formation to be not very susceptible to solvent effects.


2. Ionic Interactions
2.1. Some Remarks About Ion Hydration
While interactions of ions in the gas phase can approach the
strength of covalent bonds, the high relative permittivity of
water (ɛ=78) weakens these interactions by almost two orders
of magnitude. In addition, ions are often strongly hydrated in
water as reflected in pronounced negative Gibbs free energies
of hydration.[34] The removal of solvation shells during complex
formation, even only partially, therefore comes at a significant
energetic cost, which causes interactions between charged
species in water to be not very efficient unless they are
complemented by other types of interactions. Indeed, a single
salt bridge in water was estimated to be only worth between 5
and 8 kJmol 1 (corresponding to logKa values of ca. 1),[1,35] and
simple ions should therefore be fully dissociated at the
millimolar concentrations commonly used in supramolecular
chemistry.
At higher salt concentrations, ranging from molar concentrations to concentrations at which not enough water molecules are present to hydrate all the ions, ion pairing in water
cannot be neglected, however.[36–38] The decreased reorientation
dynamics of a small fraction of water molecules, which was
observed by dielectric relaxation and femtosecond mid-infrared
spectroscopy in various salt solutions containing biologically
relevant cations and anions indicated, for example, that ion
pairs exist in these solutions, in which a single solvent layer
(SIPs) or two intact solvation shells (2SIPs) separate the two
ions.[38] Methods such as far-infrared absorption studies, X-ray
absorption studies, and molecular dynamics simulations provided evidence also for the existence of contact ion pairs (CIPs),
in which the cation and the anion are hydrated together. These
three types of ion pairs differ energetically, as reflected in the
free energy of bringing their constituents together to the
respective distance r (Figure 1a).[8] The energetically most
favorable situation is usually the CIP, unless the cation and the
anion differ considerably in size. In this case, the arrangements
of water molecules in the solvation shells of the two ions are
incompatible because the small ion is efficiently hydrated, while
the water molecules around the larger ion are more loosely
arranged. As a consequence, SIPs become energetically more
favorable than CIPs or 2SIPs (Figure 1b).
Indeed, salts containing a combination of a large and a
small ion are more water-soluble than salts containing only
large or only small ions. This observation led Collins to
formulate the law of matching water affinities,[39,40] which
predicts that the pairing of two small or two large oppositely
charged ions is energetically favorable. In the case of small ions,
the energetic gain of ion pairing more than compensates the
energetic cost of partially desolvating them, while the energetic
cost of desolvating two large ions is compensated by the
formation of new water-water interactions. The hydration shells
of ions that differ considerably in size do not match, however,
and ion pairing is therefore less efficient.
The widely used strategy in supramolecular chemistry to
overcome the intrinsic weakness of a single salt bridge in water
involves arranging multiple charged groups around the cavity
of a receptor. These groups not only ensure water solubility,
but also cause an increased local concentration of charges
around the binding site. Accordingly, a substrate experiences a
similar situation within the cavity of a charged host as in a concentrated salt solution, thus potentially allowing ion pairing
to contribute to complex stability.


2.2. Charged Receptors for (Oppositely) Charged Substrates
Among the few receptors that mainly use ionic interactions for
substrate binding are the tetraammonium hosts 1 a,b (Figure 2)
developed a while ago by Schmidtchen.[41,42] These cage-type
receptors feature four quaternary ammonium centers at the
corners, which render them water-soluble and fourfold positively charged, independent of the pH. They bind halides and
other inorganic anions, but with not very pronounced affinities.
Both 1a and 1 b most strongly bind to bromide, for example,
with a logKa value of 2.5 (ΔG0= 14.3 kJmol 1).[41] These
complexes are thus somewhat less stable than predicted based
on Schneider’s increment of 5–8 kJmol 1 per salt bridge.[43,44]
Ion pairing alone therefore seems to be insufficient to realize
strong binding in water.
The comparison of the binding properties of receptors 2
and 3 supports this assumption.[45] While the tetraprotonated
form of 2 binds adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with a logKa of
3.8, no interaction between 3 and ATP was detected under the
same conditions, in spite of the same charge state of both
receptors and the even higher charge density of 3. Obviously, 3
and ATP are so well hydrated and the charges so well screened
in water that ionic interactions are negligible between the two
ions at the distance at which they can approach each other.
The tetraprotonated form of 2, on the other hand, can approach
the oxygen atoms of ATP at a much smaller distance. As a
consequence, electrostatic interactions become significant
stronger or, in another terminology, H424+ can form four
charge-assistant hydrogen bonds to the triphosphate group of
ATP. High anion affinity is, indeed, a general feature of such
polyammonium receptors. Many other examples exist, rendering these compounds one of the largest and structurally diverse
receptor classes for anions in water.[19–22,27]
While early investigations mainly focused on elucidating
how structural aspects and the degree of protonation influence
anion affinity and selectivity, interesting catalytic properties,[46]
and bioactivities were later discovered,[27] including the potential to treat Leishmaniasis, a widespread parasitic disease.[47]
With respect to the topic of this review it is worth noting that
the anion binding of polyammonium receptors, including the
receptors developed by Schmidtchen, is usually strongly
exothermic,[42,48] which is a thermodynamic signature that is
characteristic for many host-guest interactions in water.
Charge-assisted hydrogen bonds are also operative in
Schmuck’s guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole (GCP)-based receptors,
which primarily serve to bind carboxylates or phosphates.[27,49] A
guanidinium moiety serves in these systems as the primary
binding site that in itself has unusual properties in water.[50]
Guanidinium ions are protonated at pH values up to 12 due to
their high pKa, for example, and feature a seam of hydrogen
bond donors along the edge of their planar structure. In
contrast to spherical ammonium ions, hydrating water molecules therefore mainly encircle the edge of the ion, leaving the
more hydrophobic surfaces somewhat exposed. Accordingly,
guanidinium ions can stack in water to afford dimers, in which
the Coulomb repulsion is overcompensated by dispersion
interactions and solvent effects.[51] This pairing of like-charged
ions could explain why arginine-rich peptides readily penetrate
cell membranes.[52] In addition, the ability of guanidinium ions
to pair with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in
proteins, including the guanidinium groups in the side chain of
arginine residues, is the reason why they efficiently denature
proteins.
When pairing with oppositely charged oxoanions such as
carboxylates, guanidinium groups form two parallel hydrogen
bonds as shown schematically in Figure 3. The respective ion
pairs are not very stable in water, however, as already pointed
out by Collins.[39] Arginine residues in proteins are therefore
often located in regions of the folded peptide backbone where
the permittivity is lower, resulting in more efficient guanidinium-anion interactions.[53] For similar reasons, there are only a
few synthetic guanidinium-based anion receptors that are
active in water, and most of them contain more than one
guanidinium group.[54,55] The efficiency of Schmuck’s GCP-based
receptors is due to a network of highly efficient charge-assisted
hydrogen bonds in which the pyrrole unit is also involved
(Figure 3). The simple self-complementary GCP derivative 4 thus
dimerizes in water, forming a complex with a logKa of 2.2.[56]
The possibility to further modulate substrate binding by
structural variation of the substituents in the 5-position of the
pyrrole ring, as shown schematically in Figure 3, renders the
GCP group a versatile building block for the development of
receptors, chemosensors, gene transfection agents, and for
realizing various types of self-assembled architectures in
water.[49]


Further cyclic and acyclic receptors with charged groups
along the binding site are shown in Figures 4 and 5. The
octaanionic γ-cyclodextrin derivative 5, known as sugammadex
and sold under the trade name Bridion™, is used to treat side
effects of steroid-derived anesthetics such as rocuronium 6.[57]
The mode of action involves sequestering rocuronium by
complexation, thereby preventing it from interacting with its
biological target. The high logKa of the respective complex of
7.3 can partly be attributed to ionic interactions between the
carboxylate groups along the cyclodextrin ring and the
rocuronium ammonium group.[58]
The Isaacs group has shown that acyclic cucurbiturils (aCBs)
bind rocuronium and related steroid-derived drugs with an
affinity that is on par with or even higher than that of
sugammadex.[59] These receptors can therefore also be used as
sequestration agents, not only for neuromuscular blockers but
also for various drugs of abuse.[57,60] In addition, they improve
the solubility and bioactivity of hydrophobic pharmaceuticals,
potentially allowing their use in drug formulations.[61]
To elucidate the effect of the charged groups on complex
stability, the receptor properties of a series of aCB derivatives
were compared.[62] A trend suggesting that complex stability
benefits from ionic interactions is the increase of cation affinity
when going from a neutral water-soluble aCB (7a)[63] to one
with two sulfonate groups[64,65] and finally to one with four
negatively charged groups.[62] Unsurprisingly, the cationic aCB
7 b has the lowest cation affinity,[63] but binds anionic substrates
such as ATP.[66] The distance of the sulfonate groups from the
cavity opening also influences binding strength, but the effects
are often not very pronounced and easy to rationalize. Among
the aCBs 7c–e and 8 a–c, containing substituents with ethylene,
propylene, and butylene chains in the substituents, for example,
the ones with propylene chains often possess comparable or
even higher cation affinities than the analogs with longer or
shorter chains (Table 1). Accordingly, the distance of the
sulfonate groups from the cavity opening is not the only factor
determining binding strength.[67]
The aCB 7 f with sulfate groups directly attached to the
aromatic units binds dicationic substrates stronger by factors
ranging between 6 and 12 in 20 mM aqueous phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) than aCBs with flexible substituents.[68] In the case of
guests with two quaternary ammonium head groups, the
affinity of 7f is even 75 times higher than that of 7 c.
Accordingly, bringing the negatively charged groups closer to
the binding sites helps, but the much larger effect observed for
quaternary ammonium ions compared to other cations indicates that electrostatics alone cannot explain all of the observed
effects. The greater ease with which the larger cations are
dehydrated likely plays an additional role. In addition, the
pronounced exothermicity typically associated with complex formation suggests that ionic interactions are not the only
driving force of binding.



Like aCBs, pillararenes also allow arranging charged groups
at both cavity openings.[69] Such pillararenes are not only watersoluble, but also exhibit pronounced affinities for oppositely
charged guests. For example, the pillar[5]arenes 12a (Figure 5)
with 10 carboxylate groups and 13a with 12 carboxylate groups
bind paraquat 14 in water with logKa values of 4.9[70] and 8.0,[71]
respectively. In an independent study, log Ka values of 6.9 and
8.2 were determined for the same complexes by using
isothermal titration calorimetry.[72] The paraquat complex of the
corresponding pillar[7]arene with 14 carboxylates even has a
logKa of 9.5.[73] Although the better fit of the guest in the larger
cavities could be partly responsible for this trend, an additional
factor is likely the reinforcement of complex stability with
increasing number of negative charges in the host.
In a systematic study, Isaacs and co-workers compared the
cation affinities of the carboxymethylated pillararenes 12a and
13a with those of pillararenes containing sulfonate and sulfate
groups.[72] They were particularly interested in the receptor
properties of the pillararenes 12b and 13b (Figure 5) with the
anionic groups in the immediate vicinity of the cavity openings
as in 7 f. It turned out that both of these pillararenes have
extraordinarily high cation affinities, much higher than 12a,
13a, or the sulfonated pillararene 13c with the anionic groups
arranged at a larger distance from the cavity (Table 2). No
improvement of cation affinity was observed when further
enlarging the ring, in turn increasing the number of negatively
charged substituents, which suggests that binding is only partly
due to ionic interactions. A particularly pronounced improvement of cation affinity was observed for guests containing
quaternary ammonium ions, mirroring to some extent the effect
observed for 7 f. For these guests, cation affinity approaches the
picomolar range, explaining why 12b and 13b were named
Pillar[n]MaxQ.[72] For all studied receptors, complex formation is
again strongly exothermic with a smaller but favorable entropic
term.
By arranging cationic instead of anionic substituents along
the cavities of pillararenes, the binding of anionic substrates
can be achieved. These substituents thus overcompensate the
intrinsic preference of the electron-rich aromatic moieties
surrounding the pillararene cavity to interact with cations
through cation-π interactions. In the respective complexes, an
example is the 1-octylsulfonate complex of 12b, the apolar part
of the guest is included into the cavity while the anionic head
group is arranged close to the cationic groups in the
substituents.[74] The pillar[6]arene 13d interacts efficiently with
dicarboxylic acids and the amino acids glutamic acid and
aspartic acid in water.[75]
Another family of receptors with charged groups at both
cavity openings is based on the molecular tweezers developed
by Klärner and Schrader.[76] The respective receptors 15a–d
(Figure 5) have a high affinity for the positively charged groups
in the side chains of lysine and arginine, also when exposed on
protein surfaces, which leads to interesting biological activities.
These tweezers can modulate the abnormal protein aggregation associated with diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, for example, and destroy enveloped viruses,
including HIV, Ebola, and Zika viruses, rendering them highly
promising supramolecular drug candidates.[76]
The quantification of binding affinity showed that the
affinity in terms of log Ka of 15a to the protected amino acid
Ac-Lys-OMe (16) in 200 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) amounts
to 4.8. Under the same conditions, Ac-Arg-OMe (17) is bound
with a slightly reduced logKa of 4.2, which was attributed to the
lower charge density of the guanidinium group in the side
chain of arginine in comparison to the ammonium group in
lysine. The cation affinity of the tweezers 15b and 15c, which
contain singly charged residues, is lower than that of 15a, and
15d, whose anionic groups are arranged at a larger distance to
the cavity opening, has the lowest cation affinity in this series.
Tweezers with only one negatively charged substituent also
bind cations much less strongly than 15a. All of these trends
suggest that ionic interactions contribute to the cation affinity
of these receptors.
Unlike the receptors presented so far, sulfonated calixarenes
such as 18a have cone-like shapes, conformationally stabilized
by a ring of hydrogen bonds between the phenolic OH groups.
The deprotonation of the first OH group is associated with a pKa
of 3.3,[77] and such calixarenes are therefore overall fivefold
negatively charged in water at physiological pH. Accordingly, a
substrate included into the cavity is not only surrounded by the
four anionic substituents but also arranged close to a phenolate
oxygen atom. The effect of this group on cation complexation
was assessed by comparing the affinities for the trimethylanilinium (TMA) cation at pH 6.0 and 2.0.[78] At the acidic pH,
where all phenol oxygen atoms are protonated, the TMA
complex of 18a is less stable by a factor of almost 6 than at
pH 6.0, indicating that the negative charge at the lower rim
indeed improves cation affinity (pH 6.0: logKa=5.3, pH 2.0:
logKa=4.5). The pH-independent cation affinity of the corresponding butylated anionic calix[4]arene 18b is consistent with
this assumption. This receptor binds TMA less efficiently than
18a (log Ka=3.0), which was attributed to the effect of the butyl
groups on the calixarene conformation: while 18a favors the
cone conformation, which is well suited for the incorporation of
quaternary ammonium ions, alkylated calix[4]arenes adopt the
pinched cone conformation in which two opposing aromatic
subunits are oriented close to one another in an almost parallel
manner.[78] This arrangement is not well suited for the binding
of spherical guests.


Sulfonatocalix[4]arenes interact with a variety of biomolecules and pharmaceutically active compounds, allowing their
use in medicinal applications.[79] In addition, 18a can be used
for sensing purposes and has been shown to mediate the
detoxification of viologen derivatives.[80] The Hof group furthermore demonstrated that 18a possesses a pronounced affinity
for trimethyllysine, a lysine derivative with a trimethylated
amino group in the side chain. This amino acid is bound with a
logKa of 4.6 in 40 mM phosphate butter at pH 7.4,[81] while the
logKa of the lysine complex of 18a amounts to 2.7 under the
same conditions. Calixarene 18a is therefore a valuable
supramolecular tool to study the methylation of amino acid
side chains during the posttranslational modification of
proteins.[27] While the preferred binding of 18a to quaternary
ammonium groups could be due to a better fit of these groups
into the calixarene cavity, allowing cation-π interactions to
contribute to complex stability, differences in the hydration of
protonated and quaternary ammonium ions might also play a
role (see above).
In a recent collaborative effort, the stabilities and binding
modes of complexes of 7 d, 8 b, 15a, and 18a with arginine,
lysine, and methylated derivatives of these amino acids were
compared.[82] Consistent with previous results, the calixarene
18a was found to bind the native amino acids only weakly, but
complex stability improved progressively with increasing
degree of methylation, reaching a logKa of 3.9 for trimethyllysine in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The observed
trends for the aCBs 7 d and 8 b were similar, but the overall
affinities were at least one order of magnitude higher than
those of 18a. The tweezer 15a exhibited a different selectivity,
binding most strongly to the unmethylated amino acids. Ionic
interactions alone do not explain these selectivities, since the
charge state of all substrates was the same and the charge
states of the receptors similar. Instead, structural parameters are
more important such as the ability of aCBs and the tweezers to
thread the guests through their cavities, thus allowing the host
and guest to make extensive contact. By contrast, the coneshaped structure of 18a restricts the interactions to the cationic
head groups of the guests.
Ionic interactions also contribute to the substrate binding of
coordination macrocycles or cages. If the ligands are cationic or
neutral or if their negative charges cannot overcompensate the
positive charges of the metal ions, such coordination complexes
are overall positively charged, causing them to preferentially
interact with anions.[31] Examples are the coordination cages
19[83] and 20[84] (Figure 6) in which anion binding is furthermore
reinforced by hydrogen bonding to donors in the ligands. By
contrast, the overall neutral metallacrowns developed in the
Severin group strongly interact with small alkali metal ions
through ion-dipole interaction (Section 3.2),[85] and the 12-fold
negatively charged coordination cage 21 developed by Raymond, in which six bis(catecholate) ligands are coordinated to
four gallium(III) ions, possesses a pronounced affinity for
ammonium and phosphonium ions in water.[86] Accordingly, the
charge states of such coordination compounds control binding
selectivity. In the case of 21, large positive entropic terms of
complex formation suggest that binding benefits from the
release of water molecules from the receptor cavity.[87]
These and further examples[88–93] illustrate that ionic interactions in water contribute to the stability of host-guest
complexes. The high stabilities observed for certain complexes,
the pronounced exothermicities associated with complex
formation, and some binding selectivities indicate, however,
that other types of interactions, including those mediated by
the solvent, also influence binding, sometimes even to a larger
extent than salt bridge formation.


2.3. Some Remarks About Salt Effects
There are additional aspects that influence the interaction of
charged species in water. One of them is the effect of the often
not innocent counterions that compete with the substrate for
the receptor‘s binding site, thereby reducing the extent to
which the receptor-substrate complex can be formed. In other
words, the energetic gain of substrate binding is reduced by
the energetic cost of counterion decomplexation, leading to an
underestimation of complex stability in binding studies.
Such counterion effects should affect the affinity of all
charged receptors, but they are best characterized for calixarenes such as 18a.[94] This receptor binds alkali metal and
alkaline earth metal ions in the form of 1 :1 complexes. The
complex with Na+, the typical counterion of this
sulfonatocalix[4]arene, has a Ka of 85 m 1 at pD 7.4, for
example.[95] Complex stability increases with increasing ionic
radius and charge of the cation. A slightly larger stability
constant of 183 m 1 was obtained for the Na+ complex at
pH 7.0 by using ITC, meaning that about 40 % of the calixarene
molecules contain a sodium ion at a concentration of 1 mM.[96]
If additional buffer salts are present, the degree of complexation is significantly higher. Accordingly, counterions and potential buffer cations directly influence the interaction of 18a
with any given substrate and if these effects are not considered
when evaluating the results of binding studies, no reliable
information about the true stability of the complex of interest
can be obtained. Indeed, conflicting reports on the stability of
some calixarene complexes likely originated from the different
conditions under which the measurements were performed
and/or the different binding models used to evaluate the
results.[96] If counterion complexation is properly accounted for,
however, the stability of a complex can be determined in a
single titration.[97]
Counterion complexation of 18 a also influences the
thermodynamic signature of substrate binding, which for many
organic cations is strongly exothermic: the complexation of
TMA is associated with a ΔH0 of  28.9 kJmol 1, for example.[78]
This exothermicity can partly be attributed to the release of Na+
ions from the calixarene cavities when replacing them with
other guests, resulting in the enthalpically favorable but
entropically unfavorable reintegration of the cations into the
water matrix. The reverse reaction, Na+ complexation, is indeed
endothermic and associated with a gain in entropy.[96] Cations
from buffer salts may also be involved in these equilibria, in
which case further effects on binding enthalpy and entropy can
be expected.[98] Accordingly, it is often problematic to limit the
discussion of the thermodynamics of complex formation in
aqueous buffers to receptor-substrate interactions and solvation
effects alone.[27]
Evidence for the pronounced effects of buffers on receptorsubstrate interactions came from Gibb and co-workers who
used the tetracationic cavitand 22 (Figure 7) as a model
receptor.[99] Two aspects were studied in this context: the effects
of the increasing ionic strength of the solution during the hostguest titration on the binding constants, and the effects of
buffer salts. The results showed that binding models neglecting
the increased screening of receptor charges when the salt
concentration during the titration rises afford only approximate
values for the actual binding strength, especially in the case of
weakly bound ions. The competitive binding of buffers to the
receptor produces, however, roughly twice the effect of screening. Accordingly, screening does not necessarily have to be
considered for strong binders, but it cannot be neglected if the
interaction is weak, in which case complex formation is also
markedly affected by the competitive binding of other ions. The
authors therefore stress that the influence of buffers in binding
studies has to be considered, even of buffers that are typically
assumed inconspicuous in biochemical studies.



Screening and competitive binding are only two effects of
ionic species that can affect binding equilibria. Another effect
was already described at the end of the 19th century by Franz
Hofmeister, who studied the influence of salts on the solubility
of proteins. Hofmeister found that certain salts precipitate egg
white protein from the aqueous solution (salting-out) while
others increase protein solubility (salting-in).[100] This work led to
separate sequences in which cations and anions are ranked
according to their salting-in and salting-out capabilities (Figure 8). In the case of anions, which usually have stronger effects
than cations, small ions with a high charge density reside at the
salting-out end of the so-called Hofmeister series and large,
charge-dispersed, and weakly hydrated ions at the opposite
end. Subsequent work revealed correlations between the
position of ions in the Hofmeister series and their effects on
many bulk properties of water,[101] demonstrating that the salt
properties discovered by Hofmeister are of general relevance.
Unfortunately, there is still no simple and universal concept that
explains all of the observed phenomena.[16,102,103]
Models explaining the Hofmeister series initially concentrated on the effects of ions on the water structure. That
electronic effects cause the water molecules in the first
solvation shell to direct their oxygen atoms toward a cation,
while the reverse arrangement is preferred in the case of an
anion is obvious. In addition, ions also influence the number
and dynamics of hydrogen bonds between the surrounding
water molecules, as shown by various experimental techniques
and molecular dynamics simulations.[36–38,104] Whether these
effects extend beyond the first solvation shell is, however, an
open question.[37] A parameter associated with the effect of an
ion on the surrounding water molecules is the ion‘s structural
entropy,[37] with positive values of ΔSstruc indicating that the
order around the ion decreases due to a loss of hydrogen
bonds. Conversely, negative ΔSstruc values suggest that water
structuring occurs in the solvation shell. Structural entropy thus
indicates that ions can act as structure-makers (ΔSstruc <0) or
structure-breakers (ΔSstruc >0),[37] at least in the first solvation
shell. Alternatively, the terms “kosmotropes” or “chaotropes” are
used for structure-makers and structure-breakers, respectively,
although these terms were originally introduced to describe the
salting-out and salting-in properties of ions,[105] and it is therefore not generally accepted to use them in other contexts.[16,25]
A selection of ΔSstruc values is collected in Table 3 together with
ΔGHB, a parameter that specifies how many hydrogen bonds are
lost (negative value) or gained (positive value) when the
respective ion is dissolved in water.[37] Table 3 shows that, at
least for anions, there is a correlation between the ΔSstruc values
and the position of the ion in the Hofmeister series


Nau and co-workers demonstrated that large anions such as
dodecaborates are particularly strong structure-breakers, with
ΔSstruc values exceeding 150 J K 1 mol 1 (Table 3 ), and they used
this property to rationalize the unusually strong binding of
such, in their terminology, “superchaotropic” anions to γ-
cyclodextrin (see Section 5.2).[106]
Although Table 3 suggests that larger, charged dispersed
ions tend to have positive ΔSstruc values it is important to note
that hydrophobicity does not necessarily qualify an ion to be
also a structure-breaker. The tetrabutylammonium is, for
example, a structure-maker due to hydrophobic hydration,[107,108]
that is, the structuring of the water molecules surrounding the
hydrophobic side chains (see Section 3.1).
Thus, correlations can be found between the position of
ions in the Hofmeister series and their effect on the water
structure, at least in the first hydration shell. There is even
evidence that the Hofmeister series of anions arises from
electrostatic interactions and can be rationalized by using a
relatively straightforward model based on the radial charge
densities of anions.[103] This model allows the quantification of
ion effects such as hydration enthalpies, diffusion coefficients,
or Gibbs energies for the transfer of an anion from water to
methanol. However, it is questionable whether the probably
only local effects of ions on water structure are solely
responsible for their influence on the solubility of large
biomolecules such as proteins. There are, in fact, arguments
against this view. An important one is that the same ion can
cause both the salting-in and the salting-out of proteins under
certain conditions.[110] Alternative concepts therefore exist that
attribute Hofmeister’s findings to direct interactions between
proteins and ions: ions that interact with proteins are believed
to screen protein-protein interactions and thus improve protein
solubility, while salting-out ions exclude water molecules from
protein surfaces, leading to protein precipitation. Indeed, it was
shown that weakly hydrated anions (I , ClO4 or SCN ) and
strongly hydrated cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, or Li+) interact with
protein backbones, while strongly hydrated anions (F or SO42 )
and weakly hydrated cations (Cs+ or NH4+) do not.[102] Further
evidence for direct interactions between salting-in anions and
hydrophobic solutes came from Gibb and co-workers who
investigated the effect of salts on the interaction of adamantane carboxylate (AC) with the so-called octa acid 23a (Figure 7).[111] This work revealed that salting-out anions strengthen
the interactions between AC and 23a, while salting-in anions
cause a reduction of complex stability. Since complex formation
is mainly driven by the release of water molecules from
hydrophobic parts of the two binding partners that make
contact in the complex, the effect of salting-out anions was
attributed to the enhancement of the hydrophobic effect (see
Section 3.1), caused by the anions’ tendency to preferentially
interact with water molecules rather than the receptor. Saltingin anions such as perchlorate, on the other hand, were shown
to enter the hydrophobic binding pocket of 23a. Although the
underlying interaction is not very strong, the perchlorate
complex has a logKa of 2.0, for example, the competition of AC
and the anion for the binding site of the receptor provides a
rationale for the observed reduction of AC affinity. The
stabilizing effect of salting-out anions on the stability of the
perchlorate complex is consistent with this finding.[112] Calorimetric investigations showed that the formation of the
perchlorate complex is exothermic and associated with an
adverse entropic term, which was attributed to the simultaneous inclusion of on average 3.1 highly organized water
molecules along with the anion into the binding pocket.
Accordingly, the replacement of the perchlorate anion by AC is
associated with a slightly positive ΔH0 but a pronounced gain
in entropy.[113]
Based on these results, the authors argued that direct
interactions between certain anions with the surface-exposed
hydrophobic residues of proteins account for their influence on
protein solubility. To test this assumption, the effects of anions
on the solubility of ubiquitin was studied.[114] Several binding
sites for charge-dispersed anions were detected in this small
protein, with anion binding to these sites leading to an
improvement of protein solubility under suitable conditions.
Under conditions where the screening of positively charged
solubilizing groups along the protein backbone was dominant,
however, also protein precipitation occurred. Protein solubility
thus depends on an interplay of different factors. Other authors
also demonstrated the binding of weakly hydrated anions to
hydrophobic regions of proteins,[115] while no direct anionprotein interactions were found in a related study,[116] which led
the respective authors to conclude that the effects of the
investigated anions were in this case mediated by solvent
interactions, that is, by the way in which the protein interacts
with water molecules. Hofmeister’s results therefore still raise
many questions, even after more than 125 years of research.


3. Ion-Dipole and Dipole-Dipole Interactions
3.1. Some Remarks About the Hydrophobic Effect
Interactions between binding partners with extended hydrophobic surfaces are driven in water to a large degree by the
hydrophobic effect.[13–15] This effect is due to the thermodynamic advantage of incorporating several hydrophobic solutes
into a single cavity within the network of water molecule rather
than including them separately into individual cavities. Direct
interactions may become operative once the solutes are close,
which then contribute to the overall binding process.
The hydrophobic effect is a specific feature of water, in
which cavity formation is energetically more costly than in
other solvents. The actual thermodynamic signature of this
process depends on the size and shape of the solute, with the
association of small hydrophobes usually being entropically
favored and enthalpically nearly neutral.[12] The reason is that
the creation of a small cavity does not require water molecules
to give up hydrogen bonds. However, the hydrogen bond
network has to reorganize around the solute, which is penalized
by entropy as demonstrated by the negative structural entropy
of small organic molecules.[117] Merging individual cavities
allows the reincorporation of water molecules into the bulk
since fewer water molecules are required to create a single,
albeit slightly larger cavity than many individual ones. While
this process should not produce a substantial change in
enthalpy, it is entropically favored, which is why a positive
entropy term is often considered an indication for a binding
process driven by the hydrophobic effect.
Receptor-substrate interactions that are solely due to
entropy are, however, not very common in water. The formation
of cyclodextrin complexes is endothermic in a few cases, for
example, but mostly displays a negative binding enthalpy.[17]
High negative binding enthalpies are also characteristic for
most of the receptors discussed in this review and cases also
exist where binding is additionally entropically disfavored.
These thermodynamic signatures are inconsistent with the
“classical” view of the hydrophobic effect, prompting Diederich
to coin the term “nonclassical” hydrophobic effect for binding
processes that are driven by enthalpy in water.[118] While the
distinction between “classical” and “nonclassical” hydrophobic
effect might suggest that two fundamentally different binding
mechanisms are at work, the reason for the different thermodynamic signatures is more likely that synthetic receptors are not
the small and convex molecules to which the “classical” view of
hydrophobic effect applies. Rather, receptors are large, have
extended aromatic surfaces, contain polar and charged groups,
and, most importantly, have cavities into which the substrate
and also water molecules can be included, even if only
fleetingly. The structural changes in the solvation shells of
typical receptors combined with the potential release of the
water molecules occupying their cavities prior to substrate
binding can therefore produce enthalpic and entropic effects
that differ profoundly from what is usually expected for the
“classical” hydrophobic effect.



Unfortunately, hydration enthalpies and entropies of receptors are often unknown and the structural changes in the
hydration shell of a receptor during substrate binding unclear.
Only few studies specifically addressed the effects of receptor
hydration on binding properties,[119–121] but independent evidence exists that the arrangement of water molecules
surrounding larger hydrophobic planar or concave surfaces in
water differs characteristically from that around small convex
molecules.[12,16] Water molecules surrounding such hydrophobes
cannot retain all the hydrogen bonds, which is enthalpically
unfavorable but an entropic advantage because the loss of
hydrogen bonds adds degrees of freedom. Depending on the
size and shape of the solute, a transition thus exists between
hydrations that are enthalpically more or less neutral and
entropically unfavorable to those that are enthalpically unfavorable but entropically advantageous. In the latter case, the
release of water molecules from the solvation shell during
complex formation should add negative enthalpic and entropic
terms to the overall thermodynamics of binding, which is
indeed observed for many receptor-substrate interactions.
That the exothermicity of binding processes could indeed
be due to the release of water molecules that cannot retain all
their hydrogen bonds when occupying (or visiting) the hydrophobic cavities of synthetic receptors was already suggested by
Bender as early as 1967.[122] Work by Nau and Biedermann lends
support to this assumption.[15] This group derived the average
number of water molecules included into the cavity of typical
receptors by molecular dynamic calculations and then determined the average number of hydrogen bonds of each
included molecule. Experimental evidence indeed exists for the
hydration of receptor cavities. Sulfonatocalix[4]arene 18a, for
example, hosts one water molecule that is stabilized by OH-π
and dispersion interactions,[123,124] which is consistent with the
results of Biedermann and Nau (Table 4), while sulfonatocalix-
[5]arene contains three water molecules in the solid state.[125] Xray crystallography moreover demonstrated that also cucurbituril cavities are extensively hydrated.[126] Biedermann and Nau
then related the number of hydrogen bonds per cavity water
molecule to the average number of hydrogen bonds in the
bulk, thus obtaining an estimate of the hydrogen bond deficit
of the cavity water molecules. Table 4 shows that this hydrogen
bond deficit differs from receptor to receptor and that it is especially large for cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), a compound whose
complexation equilibria indeed feature particularly pronounced
negative enthalpies and entropies of binding (see Section 3.2).
The term “high-energy water” has been introduced for water
molecules with a hydrogen bond deficit, but the use of this
term without a proper context can be misleading and is
therefore avoided here.[16,33,127]



Work of Ashbaugh and Gibb suggests that structural effects
may also cause receptor cavities to be preferentially dewetted
(void of water molecules) in the absence of a guest.[121] Evidence
for this notion came from the comparison of the properties of
the two structurally closely related receptors 23a and 23b
(Figure 7).[120] Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the
four methyl groups encircling the cavity of 23b have a
pronounced impact on cavity hydration: whereas the probability of observing a completely empty cavity is only 5% for
receptor 23 a, the same probability amounts to 73% in the case
of 23b. Accordingly, water is a much poorer guest for 23b than
for 23a and therefore competes less strongly in complex
formation. As a consequence, the interactions of 23b with
different carboxylic acids are more exothermic than those of
23a and since the enthalpic advantage exceeds the extent to
which entropy becomes less favorable, 23b is the better
receptor. Substrate binding in water can therefore strongly
benefit from the ability of receptors to template cavity
formation in the water matrix. For further examples, see
Sections 4.2 and 7.
It must be noted that the enthalpic and entropic net
contributions to complex formation never have only a single
cause. In addition to the potential release of cavity water,
restructuring of the solvation shell in other parts of the
receptor, some of which may be polar and therefore well
solvated, and dehydration of parts of the (often convex)
substrate also play a role. Substrate binding can moreover
involve the displacement of receptor substituents from the
cavity, or the decomplexation of counterions as discussed for
receptor 18a, making it difficult to precisely attribute the
thermodynamics of binding to a single cause. How unpredictable the interplay of these processes can be is reflected in the
dependence of the affinity of cyclophane 24 for α,ω-alkyldiammonium ions on the length of the alkyl chain (Figure 9).[128] The
combination of the hydrophobic effect and ionic interactions
causes complex formation to be exothermic in this case,
independent of the chain length of the guest. However, the
progressive increase of the absolute binding enthalpy with
increasing chain length cannot be explained by the release of
cavity water alone. While geometric considerations suggest that
the diammonium ion with the C4 chain should be bound most
strongly, since it allows the oppositely charged groups in the
receptor and the substrate to come closest, the complexes of
the guests with the C7 and C8 chains turned out to be
significantly more stable (logKa in both cases 7.6). This
unexpected trend was attributed to the more efficient hydration of the charged groups of host and guest if the ammonium
groups protrude from the cavity openings. The shorter guests
need to be desolvated for complex formation, which is
enthalpically more costly.
Hydrophobic effects can therefore be complex. The enthalpically favorable desolvation of the binding partners and/or
the solvation of the complex nevertheless represent important
and often decisive elements of complex formation in water


3.2. Receptors for Charged Substrates
Prototypic complexes in which ion-dipole interactions are
responsible for substrate binding are those between alkali
metal ions and crown ethers. Water molecules are strong
competitors in these interactions because they interact with
both binding partners, and since the polarity of the binding
partners renders substantial contributions of the hydrophobic
effect to binding unlikely, crown ether complexes are not very
stable in water. With a logKa of 2.1, the potassium affinity of 18-
crown-6 is, for example, more than two orders of magnitude
lower in water than in methanol.[129] That these complexes form
at all is due in part to the chelate effect, which causes the
interaction of a cation with the oxygen atoms of a crown ether
to be entropically more favorable than with the same number
of oxygen atoms from individual water molecules. Unsurprisingly, the cation affinity of cryptands in water is substantially
higher than that of crown ethers. Complex formation is also
often strongly exothermic, in spite of the energetic cost of
dehydrating the cation.[129]
Other receptors with converging arrangements of oxygen
atoms, albeit much better preorganized ones than those of
crown ethers, are cucurbiturils[23,24] and the metallacrowns
developed in the Severin group.[85] The latter type of receptors
can be assembled from [(cymene)RuCl2]2 and suitable 3-
hydroxy-2-pyridone derivatives. The thus formed complexes are
rigid and their converging arrangement of oxygen atoms allows
ion-dipole interactions with metal ions. Solubilizing groups
such as the piperidine residues in 25 (Figure 10) mediate water solubility. The size of the cavity is well suited to host a lithium
ion, explaining the remarkable lithium selectivity of these hosts.
Receptor 25, for example, has a Li+/Na+ selectivity of 10,000/1
and binds Li+ in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with a logKa
of 3.4, which is three orders of magnitude higher than the Li+
affinity of 12-crown-4.
The oxygen atoms along the rims of cucurbiturils create
openings that are larger than the diameter of a crown ether
with the same number of oxygen atoms, thus causing the
cation selectivity of cucurbiturils to be not very pronounced.
While earlier binding studies were performed in solvent
mixtures such as water/formic acid mixtures, in which partial
protonation of the cucurbituril carbonyl groups reduces cation
affinity,[130] recent work also provided insight into metal ion
binding at neutral pH. These measurements included various
singly, doubly, and triply charged metal ions as well as
cucurbiturils ranging from the smallest five-membered ring to
cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) 26a–d (Figure 10).[131] The results showed
that the cation affinities of cucurbiturils are typically intermediate between those of crown ethers and cryptands. Only the
smallest cucurbit[5]uril (CB5) exhibits a peak selectivity, binding
potassium best and larger and smaller cations with a lower
affinity. The cation affinity of the larger cucurbiturils generally
increases with increasing ionic radius and charge of the cation
and can reach the micromolar range. Hence, the preorganization of cucurbiturils is beneficial for cation affinity. However,
this cation affinity also causes binding studies performed in
buffer to be strongly affected by the competing effects of the
cationic buffer components.


Remarkably strong complexes are formed between cucurbiturils and ammonium ions in water.[132] Especially α,ω-diammonium ions, in which the two cationic groups are properly
spaced to allow simultaneous interactions with the carbonyl
groups at the two cucurbituril portals, form complexes with
stabilities ranking at the upper end of the stability scale of
synthetic host-guest systems.[133] Although the interaction of
ammonium and carbonyl groups is rather based on hydrogen
bonding than ion-dipole interactions, these complexes are
discussed here, in the context of cucurbituril-based receptors.
Depending on the guest, hydrogen bond formation either
involves the NH groups in protonated amines or the α-CH
groups in quaternary ammonium ions that also feature
substantial positive potentials. These interactions cause a
pronounced stabilization as demonstrated by the typically
higher stability of CB7 complexes with cationic guests than with
neutral analogs, but the exact extent of the stabilization is not
easy to assess since it results from a balance of the Gibbs free
energy required to desolvate the cationic head group of the
guest and the intrinsic strength of the respective ammoniumcarbonyl interactions. Information in this context was obtained
by comparing the stabilities of the complexes of a series of
cationic silyl ethers of the general structure 27, which
structurally differ only in the aromatic substituent that remains
outside the CB7 cavity and whose solvation in water therefore
does not affect binding.[134] The work showed that complex
stability slightly increases as the electron-withdrawing effect of
the substituent becomes stronger. However, this increase was
less pronounced than expected based on the effect of the
substituent on the intrinsic strength of the ammonium-carbonyl
interactions. The observed trend was rationalized by the
stronger hydration of the ammonium group as the substituent
becomes more electron-withdrawing. Accordingly, the stabilities of cucurbituril complexes reflect the balance between the
efficiency with which a guest interacts with the receptor and
with water molecules, which can lead to unexpected trends.
The CB7 complexes of 1-adamantylamine hydrochloride and
the corresponding quaternary ammonium ion have a comparable stability,[135] for example, although the primary amine is the
better hydrogen bond donor, and the complex of the
diamantane derivative 28 is even more stable than that of the
corresponding nonmethylated analog.[133]
In general, complex stability is higher for guests that
efficiently fill the cucurbituril cavity,[24] with some complexes
having a remarkable stability, especially in the case of CB7. The
logKa values of the CB7 complexes with the three ferrocene
derivatives 29a–c (Figure 11) amount to 9.5, 12.6, and 15.4, for
example.[136]



These extraordinarily high binding constants are not only
observed for ferrocene complexes (and therefore not due to the
special nature of the ferrocene moiety), but also for certain
adamantane complexes.[137] An almost attomolar stability was
reported for the complex between CB7 and diamantane 28,
which is thus orders of magnitude more stable than one of the
most efficient natural protein-substrate combinations, the
biotin-avidin complex.[133] It should be noted that stability
constants of this magnitude have to be determined by using
competitive titrations, and to facilitate these measurements and
make the comparison of results from different laboratories
more reliable, suitable reference compounds were identified
that permit the quantification of the stability of CB7 complexes
in the logKa range from 3 to 15.[138]
The thermodynamic parameters of the reaction between
29a–c and CB7 provide insight into the driving force of
complex formation. Table 5 shows that although binding is
strongly exothermic in all three cases, the actual enthalpic term is surprisingly insensitive to the structure of the guest. The
increase of complex stability when moving from the neutral to
the monocationic and further to the dicationic ferrocene is
therefore entirely due to the decreasing entropic disadvantage
of complex formation, which is probably due to the fact that
the release of ordered water molecules surrounding the
charged residues of 29b and 29c is entropically more favorable
than the dehydration of the neutral 29a. Thus, the stability of
the complex does not appear to benefit from the enhancement
of electrostatic interactions with the increasing number of
positive charges in the guest, although the crystal structure of
the CB7 complex of 28 suggests that such interactions exist.[137]
Their contribution to the binding enthalpy appears to be
exactly offset, however, by the greater enthalpic cost of
desolvating the charged residues.
While the pronounced negative binding enthalpies certainly
reflect the tight fit of the guest molecules in the CB7 cavity,[136]
they are also consistent with the enthalpically favorable release
of cavity water, which is especially pronounced in the case of
CB7 as discussed in Section 3.1.[15] The adverse entropic terms
supports this interpretation since reintegration of the cavity
water molecules into the water matrix reduces their degrees of
freedom. Accordingly, the exceptionally high stabilities of
certain cucurbituril complexes likely originate from a combination of different factors, the most important of which are the
perfect structural and electronic complementarity of the binding partners, their rigidity, which reduces the entropic disadvantage of complex formation, and solvent effects.


3.3. Receptors for Neutral Substrates
Classic receptors for neutral substrates in water are cyclodextrins. Guest binding involves different types of interactions,
including hydrogen bond formation and dispersion interactions.
In addition, dipole-dipole interactions between the dipole
moment of the cyclodextrin ring and the dipole moment of the
included guest contribute to complex stability. The complex of
β-cyclodextrin with 4-nitrobenzoic acid (logKa=2.5) is, for
example, less stable than that of benzoic acid (logKa=3.1)
because the nitro group reduces the dipole moment of benzoic
acid. Conversely, the complex of 4-nitrophenol (logKa=2.5)
with its larger dipole moment is more stable than that of
phenol (logKa=1.9).[17] These effects are long known and not
caused by solvent effects, and will therefore not be further
discussed here.


4. Cation-π, Anion-π and CH-π Interactions
4.1. Some Remarks About Interactions Involving π-Systems in
Water
Aromatic systems feature characteristic electrostatic potentials
along their surface, which allow them to engage in interactions
with oppositely charged or polarized substrates.[139] These
interactions are mainly electrostatic in nature and can be
remarkably strong. In the gas phase, the interaction between a
potassium ion and the face of a benzene ring is, for example,
almost as strong as the interaction between K+ and a water
molecule.[140] Like salt bridges, such cation-π interactions[140,141]
become weaker as the polarity of the medium increases, but
there is an important difference between ion pairing and
cation-π interactions: in the case of salt bridges, two strongly
hydrated ions have to come together to form an ion pair and
the interaction is therefore penalized by the partial desolvation
of both binding partners. In the case of a cation-π interaction,
only the cation is strongly hydrated while the aromatic ring is
not. Accordingly, solvation effects should affect cation-π
interactions to a smaller degree than ion pairing, which was
confirmed computationally.[142] The corresponding study demonstrated that the interaction energy between an ammonium
ion and acetate drops by a factor of more than 50 when going
from the gas phase to water. By contrast, the strength of the
cation-π interaction between ammonium and benzene,
although intrinsically weaker in the gas phase than ion pairing,
diminishes only by a factor of 3, causing the respective complex
to be more stable in water than the ammonium acetate ion
pair.
For a series of different cations, the intrinsic strength of
cation-π interactions correlates with the charge density of the
ion, becoming weaker in the gas phase for the alkali metal ions
in the order Li+ >Na+ >K+ >Rb+, for example. In solution, ion
hydration causes deviations from this trend because the more
strongly bound ions are also the ones more strongly hydrated.
For the above series of ions, this effect causes benzene to bind
most strongly to K+ in water.[143] Complex formation of Li+ and
Na+ is less favorable because of the strong hydration of the
smaller cations while the lower charge density of Rb+ renders
the interaction with an aromatic ring intrinsically weaker than
that of K+. Experimentally, cation-π interactions have been
shown to be worth circa 2 kJmol 1 per phenyl ring, which is
roughly half the interaction energy of a salt bridge (see
above).[43] Cation-π interactions between ions and receptors
whose binding sites are surrounded by several, ideally electronrich aromatic rings can nevertheless make substantial contributions to complex stability.
By contrast, anion-π interactions, the electrostatic interaction between an anion and the face of an electron-deficient π-
system,[144,145] are generally weaker that cation-π interactions.
The number of receptors in which anion-π interactions
contribute to substrate binding in water is therefore low.
Together with dispersion interactions and the hydrophobic
effect, CH-π interactions mediate the binding of neutral
substrates to receptors with aromatic residues as discussed in
Section 4.3.


4.2. Receptors for Charged Substrates
The concept of cation-π interactions emerged in conjunction
with the work of the Dougherty group on the receptor
properties of a series of cyclophanes with ethenoanthracene
units.[140] In this context, it became clear that cation-π interactions between positively charged substrates and the
aromatic side chains of amino acids also mediate the cation
binding of certain proteins.[139,141,146] Examples include acetylcholine receptors, in which an “aromatic box” in the active site
serves to recognize the cationic head group of the substrate.
Today, cation-π interactions are considered one of the most
important types of noncovalent interactions and they are
typically invoked to explain the cation affinity of synthetic
receptors with electron-rich aromatic moieties such as cyclophanes, cryptophanes, calixarenes, cavitands, pillararenes, the
coordination cage developed by Raymond, and the molecular
tweezers and clips developed by Klärner. The binding properties of these systems have been reviewed,[76,86,139–141,147,148] and
only a few aspects relating to cation recognition in water will
therefore be discussed here.
Evidence that cation-π interactions contributed to the
substrate affinity of the family of cyclophanes developed by
Dougherty came from the comparison of the affinities of 30a
and 30b (Figure 12) for the N-methylquinolinium cation 31.[149]
With a logKa of 5.6, the complex of 30a with 31 is about one
order of magnitude more stable than that of 30b in borate
buffer at pD 9.0, which was attributed to the larger number of
possible cation-π interactions in 30a. If dispersion interactions
would dominate binding, 30b should be the better receptor
since cyclohexane is more polarizable than benzene. The
cationic 31 is also more strongly bound by 30a by a factor of
approximately 10 than the isosteric but neutral 4-methylquinoline 32, which confirmed the stabilizing electrostatic
interactions between the cationic guest and the negative
electrostatic potentials along the faces of the aromatic cyclophane residues. Structural investigations showed that the
ammonium group rather than the tert-butyl group of 33 is
preferentially inserted into the cavity of 30a,[150] and, as
observed for many other receptors in water, complex formation
is exothermic and accompanied by a favorable entropic
term.[151] Building on these findings, structural variations subsequently afforded analogs of 30a with interesting selectivities,
for example for the guanidinium moiety in arginine.[152]


The beneficial effects of the ethenoanthracene residues in
30a on cation affinity inspired other groups to use a dithiol
analog of this building block for the identification of cation
binders by using dynamic combinatorial chemistry.[153] In this
context, Sanders and Otto showed, for example, that the
addition of 34 to a mixture of dithiols in water resulted in the
amplification of cyclophane 35, which was shown to have
practically the same affinity for 35 under comparable conditions
as Dougherty’s original cyclophane 30a.[154] By varying the
structure of the templating ammonium salt, other cyclic
oligomers of the ethenoanthracene-derived dithiol were obtained. A cationic morphine derivative, for example, afforded a
macrocyclic homotrimer[154] and the small tetramethylammonium ion a homotetramer.[155] The latter result was
rationalized by the tight folding of the large macrocycle around
the small cation. In a similar vein, the Waters group used
ethenoanthracene dithiols to develop binders that recognize
posttranslational modifications in proteins. They showed in this
context that 35 binds to the trimethyllysine (Kme3) residue in
the peptide Ac-WGGGQTARKme3STG-NH2 with a log Ka of 5.6
(10 mM borate buffer, pH 8.5).[156] Structural variations subsequently allowed improving this affinity and changing selectivity
for methylated arginine derivatives. This work, which demonstrates the potential use of such cyclophanes in biomedicinal
applications, has recently been reviewed.[27]
In contrast to the receptors discussed in Section 2.2, the
solubilizing anionic groups in receptors 30 a, b and 35 diverge
from the binding site and ionic interactions between these
groups and the included substrate should therefore not be
very pronounced. To quantify whether these interactions
nevertheless occur, the binding properties of 30 a and the
neutral water-soluble analog 30 c were compared. It turned
out that the cation affinity of 30 c is about one order of
magnitude lower than that of 30 a, demonstrating that ionic
interactions in the complexes of 30 a make a nonnegligible
contribution to binding.
Similar long range electrostatic interactions could also exist
in the complexes of the conformationally fixed calix[4]arene
derivative 36 (Figure 13) with quaternary ammonium ions and
could partly account for the preferential inclusion of the
cationic head group of the guest into the calixarene cavity, but
the extent of this stabilization beyond the also existing cation-π
interactions has not been assessed.[157] More informative are
investigations in which the deepened cavitands 37a–d were
used. The parent receptor 37a forms stable complexes with
cationic guests such as acetylcholine in water.[158] According to
the observed complexation-induced signal shifts in the 1H NMR
spectra, the ammonium group of acetylcholine resides at the
bottom of the cavity in the complex, suggesting that cation-π
interactions between the cationic residue and the electron-rich
moieties of the receptor control the mode of binding.
Independent studies showed, however, that the ammonium
either resides at the bottom or the opening of the cavity of 37a, depending on the conditions, and that cation-π
interactions can thus be overcompensated by other effects.[159]
Insight into the extent to which the different types of
interactions operate in these complexes was obtained by
comparing the behavior of receptors 37b–d and structurally
related cavitands toward 33 and a series of other guests
containing both a quaternary ammonium group and a tert-butyl
residue.[160]



The authors showed that all investigated cavitands prefer to
bind guests in which the hydrophobic tert-butyl group and the
cationic ammonium group are positioned at a relatively large
distance by incorporating the tert-butyl group into the cavity.
The desolvation of the tert-butyl group and its dispersion
interactions with the cavity walls are obviously more favorable
that the desolvation of the ammonium group that would allow
binding to benefit from cation-π interactions. Shorter guests
behave similarly, but not with cavitands 37b–d. In these
receptors, the imidazole methyl groups produce a hydrophobic
environment along the cavity rim that is also suitable for
positioning the tert-butyl residue at the cavity opening. The
guest 33 thus inserts into the receptor cavity either with the
ammonium group or the tert-butyl group first and since guest
exchange is slow on the NMR time-scale, both arrangements
can be distinguished. In the complex between 33 and 37d
containing the zwitterionic solubilizing groups, the two isomeric
complexes are almost equally populated, while the arrangement with the ammonium group located outside the cavity is
favored by circa 4 kJmol 1 in the case of 37c. This situation is
reversed for the negatively charged receptor 37b. The authors
therefore concluded that long range ionic interactions can
control the mode of binding, and that these interactions can tip
the balance between a complex that benefits from cation-π
interactions and one that does not.
In spite of the cationic nature of the solubilizing substituents, the cation affinity of the tetraphosphonate cavitand 38
(Figure 13), which was described by Dalcanale and co-workers,
benefits from cation-π interactions in water.[161] Such cavitands
interact with zwitterionic amino acids and N-methyl amino
acids in methanol by hydrogen bonding between the NH group
of the guests and the converging P=O oxygen atoms along the
cavity. In the case of N-methyl amino acids, the complexes are
additionally stabilized by cation-π interactions between the
aromatic receptor residues and the N-methyl group incorporated into the cavity. In water, only N-methyl amino acids are
bound (with an affinity that is about 3 orders of magnitude
lower than in methanol), likely because hydrogen bonding
alone is not sufficient to mediate complex formation in the
more competitive solvent. The complexation of N-methyl amino
acids is strongly exothermic in water and opposed by entropy,
which was attributed to the size of the receptor cavity that is
too small to host water molecules. Cavitand 38 therefore
templates water cavitation in a similar manner as receptor 23b.
Thus, complex formation does not benefit from receptor
dehydration in this case, and the thermodynamics of complex
formation reflect the enthalpically favorable direct interactions
of the binding partners in conjunction with their entropically
unfavorable loss of degrees of freedom.
Receptors engaging in anion-π interactions have mainly
been studied in organic solvents.[144,145] Since X-ray crystallography suggested that anion-π interactions cause the bromide
counterions of the water-soluble tricationic compound 39
(Figure 14) to reside above the planes of the triazolium moieties
in the solid state, anion binding of this and related tripodal
receptors was also studied in water.[162] Binding is weak: the
best receptor binds iodide with a logKa of 2.7, for example, and
the contributions of ionic and anion-π interactions to complex
formation could not be separated.


4.3. Receptors for Neutral Substrates
CH-π interactions between the edges and the faces of aromatic
rings stabilize the complexes between many cyclophanes and
aromatic guests.[139] Classic examples of such cyclophanes, all of
which bind neutral aromatic substrates in water, are Koga’s
protonated tetraamine 40, Diederich’s family of dicationic
diphenylmethane derivatives, of which 41 is a member, and
Stoddart’s blue box 42 (Figure 15). In the case of the latter two
receptors, solvent-dependent binding studies demonstrated
that complex stability increases when going from organic
solvents to water, as expected for receptors whose binding
benefits from the hydrophobic effect.[118,163] It is also worth
noting that the negative binding enthalpies associated with
complex formation of 41 in water led to the concept of the “nonclassical” hydrophobic effect.[118] Since these investigations
have been reviewed,[139] they are not described in detail here.
CH-π interactions between the faces of aliphatic cycloalkanes and π-systems also exist,[164] contributing to the
substrate recognition of the carbohydrate receptors that were
developed in the groups of Davis and others. These systems are
discussed in Section 5.3 and the interaction of alkanes with
water-soluble cavitands in Section 7


5. Hydrogen Bonding
5.1. Some Remarks About Hydrogen Bonding in Water
Hydrogen bonds are formed between positively polarized
hydrogen atoms in one molecule and regions of negative
electrostatic surface potential, usually caused by the presence
of a heteroatom, in the corresponding binding partner. The
polarization of the hydrogen atom in the hydrogen bond donor
is often due to a directly bound heteroatom, but structural
effects can also allow CH bonds to serve as donors. Since only
the strongest hydrogen bonds are able to outcompete the
hydration of neutral binding partners,[165] examples are hydrogen bonds between the OH groups of hexafluoroisopropanol or
nonafluoro-tert-butanol and the oxygen atoms in sulfoxides or
phosphine oxides, other hydrogen donors and acceptors can
only contribute to substrate binding in water if additional
factors reinforce the complex. Charge-assisted hydrogen bonds
are, for example, stronger than hydrogen bonds between
neutral compounds, and introducing charges into one or both
binding partners can therefore be beneficial. Charged groups
are, however, also more difficult to dehydrate than neutral ones
so that potential effects of charge-assisted hydrogen bonds can
turn out to be smaller than expected. Multivalency also plays a
role, that is, the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between
host and guest. Finally, hydrogen bonds are stronger in an
environment that has a lower permittivity than water, and
hydrogen bonds in proteins are therefore mostly buried within
the folded protein chain. For the same reason, hydrogen bond
formation between synthetic receptors and their substrates
generally takes place in cavities well shielded from the
surrounding solvent.[28] These cavities not only feature hydrogen
bond donors and/or acceptors along their inner surfaces but
often also hydrophobic residues that can mediate further types
of interactions and, more importantly, prevent the efficient
hydration of the converging polar groups. Dehydration is thus
facilitated, which causes binding to benefit from the release of
cavity water. Accordingly, the principles of molecular recognition by hydrogen bonding in water are not very different
from those discussed in previous sections.


5.2. Receptors for Charged Substrates
Anion receptors that rely on hydrogen bonds for substrate
binding typically contain multiple hydrogen bond donors
arranged around a cleft or cavity, often in the form of NH
groups. Examples include GCP derivatives and polyammonium
receptors that form charge-assisted hydrogen bonds to their
respective substrates (Section 2.2). Neutral NH donors form
weaker hydrogen bonds but can under certain circumstances
also mediate anion binding in water as demonstrated by the
cyclopeptides developed in the Kubik group. These cyclic
hexapeptides contain three well-preorganized NH groups at the
bottom of a concave cavity lined by hydrophobic proline
rings.[166] In the crystal structure of the parent cyclopeptide 43a
(Figure 16), three water molecules reside within this cavity, the
arrangement of which suggests that hydrating water molecules
are unlikely to form the maximum number of hydrogen bonds
in solution.[167]
The respective water-soluble derivative 43b binds halides
and sulfate in the form of 1: 1 complexes in water, but with a
low affinity: the logKa of the most stable sulfate complex only
amounts to 1.7, for example.[168] This stability may not seem
remarkable, but it still indicates that direct interactions between
the anion and the three NH groups of 43b, in conjunction with
solvent effects arising from the arrangement of the NH donors at the bottom of a hydrophobic binding site, can result in a
sufficiently large thermodynamic driving force to at least
partially overcome the efficient hydration of sulfate anions in
water.
In contrast to 43b, 43a binds halides and sulfate in the
form of 2: 1 complexes, in which an anion is sandwiched
between two cyclopeptide rings.[167] This binding mode is more
efficient than that of 43b, partly because of the larger number
of water molecules that are released from the hydrophobic
regions of the cyclopeptides when two rings come together.[169]
Accordingly, the formation of the 1 :1 complex is associated
with a significantly smaller stability constant than the binding
of this complex to the second cyclopeptide ring, which is
associated with a more extensive desolvation of the binding
partners. A further improvement of anion binding, this time as a
consequence of the chelate effect, results from covalently
connecting two cyclopeptide rings through suitable linkers.[170]
The respective bis(cyclopeptides) are mostly less soluble than
their monotopic analogs, but 43c, which contains additional
solubilizing groups attached to the aromatic cyclopeptide and
linker moieties, allowed binding studies in water.[171] These
investigations showed that with a logKa of 3.3, the sulfate
affinity of 43c is almost 2 orders of magnitude larger than that
of 43b. The iodide complex of 43c is even more stable (logKa=
3.6), while the smaller halides are bound less strongly. Sulfate
versus iodide selectivity thus reversed when going from 43b to
43c, likely because the anion has to be completely desolvated
before it can be bound between the two subunits of the
bis(cyclopeptide), which is energetically more costly for sulfate
than for iodide. The observed enthalpies of complex formation
are consistent with this interpretation (Table 6). These enthalpies are positive in the case of sulfate and the smaller halides,
showing that the binding enthalpy cannot overcompensate the
enthalpic term associated with anion dehydration. Only in the
case of the weakly hydrated iodide anion, a negative binding
enthalpy was observed. For all anions, the main driving force of
complex formation thus derives from the substantial gain in
entropy, reflecting the entropically favorable release of water
molecules from the solvation shells of the anions and the
cavities of the cyclopeptides. An endothermic complexation of
strongly hydrated pyrophosphate anions was also observed for
a tetracationic resocinarene-derived receptor.[89


Another potent class of receptors whose anion affinity in
water benefits from hydrogen bonds, in this case hydrogen
bonds involving CH donors, are the bambusurils developed by
Sindelar.[172] The two water-soluble bambus[6]urils 44a,b (Figure 17) recognize anions of widely varying sizes, ranging from
small fluoride to large hexafluoroantimonate anions, for
example.[172] The most stable complexes are formed with iodide
and perchlorate, that is, anions with ionic radii between 2.2 and
2.4 Å that are only weakly solvated in water. The respective
complexes are remarkably stable: the iodide and perchlorate
complexes of 44a, for example, have logKa values in 20 mM
aqueous phosphate buffer (pD 7.1) of 7.0 and 7.7,
respectively.[173] For comparison, the fluoride complex has a
logKa of only 2.0 under the same conditions, showing that the
anion complexes of 44a span a stability range of more than 5
orders of magnitude. Selectivity not only reflects the size
complementarity of the anion and the cavity diameter but also
correlates with the ease with which the anions are desolvated.
Repulsive electrostatic interactions between the bound
anions and the solubilizing groups of 44a, which are fully
deprotonated under the conditions of the binding studies,
destabilize the complexes, and this effect becomes stronger
with decreasing distance between the carboxylate groups and
the glycoluril subunits.[174] The neutral receptor 44b does not
suffer from this effect and therefore has an even larger anion
affinity in water than 44b. The logKa of the iodide complex
amounts to 7.5, for example.[175] Complex formation of 44a and
44b is strongly exothermic in water and opposed by entropy,
which was attributed to the release of cavity water during
complex formation.
Pittelkow’s biotin[6]uril 45 (Figure 17) mainly differs from
bambus[6]urils in that it contains D-biotin instead of glycoluril
subunits.[176–178] These units also arrange a seam of CH groups
along the inner cavity, but the selectivity of 45 differs from that
of 44a because of the presence of the tetrahydrothiophene
moieties. Complex formation of 45 in 100 mM aqueous
phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) is, however, also exothermic and
entropically unfavorable.
Six CH groups converge into the cavity of the cage-type
tricationic receptor 46 (Figure 18), which furthermore has the
perfect size to host a chloride anion.[179] The strong solvation of
this anion causes the respective complex to only have a
relatively small logKa of 1.4 in water, however, slightly smaller
than the chloride complex of the neutral bis(cyclopeptide) 43c.
The small but noticeable positive potentials of CH groups
inside the cavities of the octa acid 23a and cyclodextrins could
also contribute to the affinity of these receptors for weakly
solvated anions such as perchlorate in the case of 23a or
dodecaborates in the case of cyclodextrins. The favorable binding enthalpies and unfavorable entropies of the latter
complexes are, however, mainly due to the dehydration of the
dodecaborate anions (Section 2.3).


5.3. Receptors for Neutral Substrates
Hunter and co-workers demonstrated some time ago that the
water-soluble analog of a previously developed benzoquinone
receptor, dication 47 (Figure 19), binds the same substrate also
in water.[181] With a logKa of circa 0.7, binding is very weak,
however, although some cyclic dipeptides are bound with
about one order of magnitude greater affinity.
Work of the Jiang group showed more recently that
benzoquinone affinity can be much improved by positioning
the guest in a more hydrophobic environment.[182] The corresponding receptor 48 contains only two converging NH donors
as opposed to four in Hunter’s receptor. The anthracene side
walls of 48 create a deep hydrophobic cavity, however, into
which benzoquinone and structurally related guests fit very
well. The direct host-guest interactions not only involve hydrogen bonds between the NH groups of 48 and the CO groups of
the substrate but also CH-π interactions between appropriately
arranged aromatic residues of host and guest. In addition,
solvent effects contribute to complex stability as demonstrated
by favorable binding enthalpies but unfavorable or weakly
favorable entropies. Remarkable complex stabilities were thus
achieved: the benzoquinone complex of 48 has a logKa of 4.5,
for example, while the logKa of a water-soluble anthraquinone
derivative, which perfectly fills the cavity of 48, amounts to 9.2.
Receptor 48 is part of a larger research program of the Jiang
group targeting water-soluble receptors with hydrophobic
cavities into which hydrogen bond donors project to mediate
direct interactions with potential guest molecules. Substantial
work in this context was performed using so-called naphthotubes as receptors. These macrocyclic bislactams contain two
bis(naphthalene) clefts covalently linked through amide groups.
They are obtained as a mixture of a syn and an anti
diastereomer (49a and 49b) whose binding properties are
usually assessed independently after separation. These bislactams were originally introduced by Glass as receptors for long
chain alkyl amines, alcohols, or carboxylic acids, which are
bound in water with binding constants log Ka up to 4.4 (for the
complex between 49 a and dodecanoic acid).[183] Complex
stability increases with the chain length of the guests, indicating
that dispersion interactions and solvent effects contribute to
complex stability. Jiang later showed that these naphthotubes
also recognize small organic substrates in water, which are
normally difficult to bind.[184] The 1,4-dioxane complex of 49a
has a log Ka of 4.0, for example. Complex formation involves the
formation of hydrogen bonds between the NH groups of the
receptor and the oxygen atoms of the guest. Guests containing
only one oxygen atom (tetrahydrofuran 49a: log Ka=2.4), or
two oxygen atoms not well positioned for hydrogen bond
formation (1,3-dioxane 49a: logKa=2.3) form significantly less
stable complexes. The Jiang group subsequently demonstrated
that naphthotubes bind a variety of polar guests in water,[185]
including surrogates of nerve agents.[186] In addition, naphthotubes can be used for the chiroptical sensing of epoxides,
alcohols,[187] and carboxylic acids,[92] and for the removal of
micropollutants from water, rendering them potentially useful
for practical applications.[188]
Other macrocyclic tetralactams in which converging hydrogen bond donors and two hydrophobic anthracene units
mediate guest binding in water are receptor 50a, described by


Davis and co-workers,[189] and 51, which was developed in the
Roelens group (Figure 19).[190] Both receptors bind monosaccharides through a combination of hydrogen bonding and CH-
π interactions. The logKa of the glucose complex of 50a
amounts to 1.7, for example. Interestingly, the preorganized
macrocyclic cavity of 51 does not seem to be required for
carbohydrate binding in water since analogous acyclic, clefttype receptors with only one carbazole moiety and two
anthracene units also possess appreciable affinity, albeit mainly
for disaccharides.[191,192]
Receptor 50b has a high affinity also for heterocyclic
substrates such as purine or pyrimidine bases.[193] The complex
of 50b with hypoxanthine has a log Ka of 7.0 in water, for
example, while an analog of 50b with two disubstituted
naphthalene residues, receptor 52, has been shown to recognize riboflavin with a logKa of 7.1.[194] An extraordinarily high
logKa of 9.0 was observed for the complex between 50a and
the squaraine derivative 53.[195]
The latter complexes benefit from aromatic interactions
between the electron-poor π-systems of the aromatic guests
and the electron-rich aromatic units in the receptors. The lower
stability of the earlier mentioned carbohydrate complexes can
be attributed to the weaker nature of CH-π interactions
involving aliphatic rings and to the more difficult desolvation of
the polar substrates. However, these drawbacks can be overcome as shown by Davis and co-workers by using polycyclic
receptors with cavities structurally better defined than those of
monocyclic analogs and a greater number of hydrogen bond
donors and acceptors.[196] The first water-soluble example of
such so-called “temple” receptors, compound 54 (Figure 20),
has a low glucose affinity, although at the time of publication,
54 was the first receptor known to noncovalently interact with
carbohydrates in water.[197] Selectivity is good as demonstrated
by the difference in the logKa values of the complexes of 54
with methyl β-D-glucoside (logKa=1.5) and the corresponding
α-glucoside (logKa=0.8), and disaccharides[198] and β-N-acetylglucosamine[199] are also bound efficiently.
Solvent-dependent binding studies showed that glucose
and cellobiose affinity of 54 is higher in water than in aqueous
solvent mixtures containing methanol, DMSO, or acetonitrile as
co-solvents, demonstrating the importance of the hydrophobic
effect for carbohydrate recognition in water.[198] Subsequent
work in the Davis group, which involved varying the aromatic
units comprising the “roof” and “floor” of the temple receptors
and the structure and number of the linkers making up the
“columns,” not only revealed many principles of carbohydrate
recognition[196] but eventually also afforded receptor 55,[200]
which has an outstanding glucose affinity and selectivity. With a
logKa of 4.3, glucose is bound by 55 stronger by a factor of circa
100 than galactose and stronger by a factor of about 1000 than
a range of other carbohydrates, rendering 55 useful for
carbohydrate sensing[201] and other applications.[202]
Interestingly, NH donors may not be required in such
“temple” receptors to achieve carbohydrate recognition in
water according to results obtained by Stoddart and coworkers.[203] They introduced receptor 56 (Figure 20), consisting
of two parallel pyrene units as “roof” and “floor” that can
engage in CH-π interactions with the axially oriented protons of
carbohydrate rings. Polarized pyridinium CH bonds are available
for hydrogen bonding interactions, while the xylylene moieties
ensure the proper distance between the pyrene units. This
water-soluble receptor binds β-D-glucoside with a log Ka of 3.1
in water. While β-N-acetylglucosamine is bound more strongly
than glucose, as also observed for 54,[199] cellobiose forms a less
stable complex, which does not mirror the behavior of 54.[198]
Accordingly, 56 seems to be too rigid to host guests larger than
monosaccharides. The calorimetric characterization of complex
formation revealed that binding is enthalpically favorable and
associated with a small favorable or unfavorable entropic term,
depending on the guest


The Ballester group explored the use of aryl-extended
calix[4]pyrroles for molecular recognition in water.[25] These
compounds contain a calix[4]pyrrole core with pyrrole NH
groups as hydrogen donors. In the cone conformation of the
respective α,α,α,α-isomer, four aryl groups at the methine
groups point into the same direction, creating a deep hydrophobic cavity that is open at one end and contains four
converging NH groups at the bottom. Although such calix[4]-
pyrroles are conformationally mobile in solution, guest binding
locks them into the cone conformation, often leading to
remarkably stable complexes, also in water, whose binding
equilibria are slow on the NMR time scale. Suitable guests are
N-oxides or lactams whose NO or CO oxygen atoms form
hydrogen bonds to the pyrrole NH groups. Binding studies
showed that complex stability of the aryl-extended calix[4]-
pyrroles 57a–c (Figure 21) is relatively independent of whether
the solubilizing charged groups are cationic (57a) or anionic
(57b), or are located along the upper (57a, b) or the lower
(57c) rim of the cavity (Table 7). Binding is therefore not
strongly affected by potential electrostatic effects of the
Figure 20. Structures of temple receptors 54, 55, and 56. substituents, as expected for neutral guests. The complexes of 57a,b with 4-phenylpyridine N-oxide are
about one order of magnitude less stable than those with
pyridine N-oxide because the extended guest cannot be fully
incorporated into the cavity. This selectivity is reversed when
deepening the cavity as in the super aryl-extended calix[4]-
pyrroles 57d, e.[206,207] Receptors 57d, e bind to 4-phenylpyridine
N-oxide with nanomolar affinities, clearly demonstrating the
beneficial effects of confining the guest within a deep hydrophobic cavity in water. The comparison of the Gibbs free
energies associated with the binding of 57d, e to different 4-
substituted pyridine N-oxides showed that complex stability
increases by 0.14–0.16 kJmol 1Å 2 with the increasing surface
area of the guest, thus providing an estimate of the extent to
which the hydrophobic effect contributes to complex stability.
The affinity increase observed for the conformationally rigidified
calix[4]pyrrole derivative 58 (Figure 21) with increasing hydrogen bond acceptor strength of the guest‘s CO group in the
order ketone<lactone<lactam<urea showed that the hydrogen bonding interactions with the pyrrole NH groups have a
larger control over complex stability in this case than the
hydrophobic effect because the trend would be opposite if
complex stability would be governed by the hydrophobicity of
the guest.[208] Calorimetric studies showed that complex
formation is in all cases exothermic and accompanied by small
favorable or unfavorable entropic contributions (Table 7).
The examples presented in this section thus show that
receptors with sufficiently large cavities whose inner surfaces
are lined with both hydrophobic and polar residues can
efficiently bind neutral substrates in water, even strongly
hydrated ones such as carbohydrates. While hydrogen bonding
clearly contributes to binding, important and likely decisive
contributions also come from CH-π interactions between
aromatic residues of the host and the hydrophobic regions of
the guests. Such interactions are even more important when
they involve the edges of aromatic rings or the faces of
electron-poor aromatic residues. Finally, cavity water or partially
dewetted parts of the receptor cavity additionally favor
complex formation.



6. Halogen and Chalcogen Bonding
Halogen bonds are noncovalent interactions between Lewis
bases and organic halides.[209] To a first approximation, they can
be understood as electrostatic interactions between the negative potential surface of a neutral or negatively charged
heteroatom in the Lewis base and the region of positive
electrostatic potential in the organic halide. This region is
localized in the extension of the C Hal bond and associated
with the term σ-hole. Accordingly, halogen bonds are somewhat related to hydrogen bonds, with the difference that the
proton in the hydrogen bond donor is replaced by a halogen
atom in the respective halogen bond donor.
In contrast to hydrogen bonds, in which only protons serve
as binding partners, the halogen atom in the halogen bond
donor can vary, allowing the host structure to be adapted to
some degree to the requirements of the guest. Organic iodides
are, however, generally better halogen bond donors than
respective derivatives of the smaller halides because of the
greater polarizability of the iodine atom. Another difference
between hydrogen and halogen bonds is the pronounced
directionality of the latter, which is due to the size and location
of the σ-hole in the donor. With respect to molecular
recognition in water, halogen bonding benefits from the weak
solvation of the relatively large halogen atoms.
Similar rules apply to chalcogen bonds, in which organic
sulfur, selenium, or tellurium derivatives serve as donors.[210] The
different electron distributions along halogen and chalcogen
atoms cause differences in the preferred binding geometry of
halogen and chalcogen bonds, however.
Important contributions to the use of halogen bonds for
molecular recognition came from the Beer group.[211] Receptors
developed in this context that work in water include the α-
cyclodextrin derivative 59 (Figure 22) with two 5-iodotriazole
moieties that binds perrhenate with a log Ka of 2.8.[212] The same
anion also binds to unsubstituted α-cyclodextrin under the
same conditions, but with an about one order of magnitude
lower affinity. This comparison thus provides evidence for the
contribution of halogen bonding to complex stability, although
electrostatic interactions between the anion and the pyridinium
moieties of 59 cannot be fully ruled out. The same is true for
the anion-binding rotaxane 60a whose axle features a 3,5- disubstituted pyridinium ring with two 5-iodo-1,2,3-triazole
units as one part of the binding site.[213] Further contributions to
anion binding come from the two amide groups in the ring,
while the methylated α-cyclodextrin units serve as stoppers and
ensure water solubility. Among the anions tested, 60a binds
iodide most efficiently (logKa=3.3), but also has a weak sulfate
affinity (logKa=1.5). Iodide binding is strongly exothermic and
opposed by entropy. Interestingly, the prototriazole analog 60b
not only has a lower iodide affinity (logKa=1.3), but also binds
iodide in an endothermic process that is favored by entropy.
The authors attributed these opposite trends to the stronger
interaction of iodide with the iodotriazole-containing receptor,
which results in a more negative binding enthalpy and an
unfavorable binding entropy. The observed thermodynamic
parameters would, however, also be consistent with a more
difficult desolvation of the prototriazole-containing receptor.
The generally lower anion affinity of the prototriazole analogs
of the investigated 5-iodo-1,2,3-triazole-containing receptors,
which was also observed in other cases,[211] demonstrates the
advantage of halogen bonding for molecular recognition in
water.



The interlocked architecture does not seem to be necessary
to achieve anion binding since the much simpler bis(5-iodo-
1,2,3-triazole) derivative 61 (Figure 22) also binds iodide and, in
this case, also perrhenate.[214] Both anions are only weakly
bound and with similar affinities (log Ka ca. 1.7), but much
stronger anion binding can be achieved by using longer
oligomeric analogs of this receptor in which more than two
iodotriazole units can fold around the anion. An example is the
tetrakis(5-iodo-1,2,3-triazole) derivative 62a of which further
structurally related analogs were also studied.[215] This receptor
prefers to bind weakly hydrated anions such as iodide,
perchlorate, perrhenate, or thiocyanate. The cavity of the folded
oligomer is too small, however, to bind these anions in a 1: 1
fashion. The 1 :1 complex thus contains the anion in a perched
arrangement on top of the folded chain, leaving sufficient space
on the opposite side to allow for the binding of a second
receptor molecule. Complex formation thus involves the
stepwise formation of sandwich-type complexes, whereby the
formation of the 1 :1 complexes is generally associated with
smaller binding constants than the subsequent formation of
the 2 :1 complexes. The binding equilibria of 62b are thus
reminiscent of those of cyclopeptide 43a. The cumulative
association constants of the anion complexes of the investigated oligomeric 5-iodotriazoles reach log Ka values of 11 and
complex formation is favored by both enthalpy and entropy.
Interestingly, in cases where the overall enthalpic and entropic
contributions could be broken down to those associated with
the individual binding steps it turned out that only the first step
is exothermic and that this step is opposed by entropy. The
second step is slightly endothermic but has a high positive
entropy. The authors attributed the favorable binding enthalpy
of the first step to the formation of the four halogen bonds that
does not require the full dehydration of the anion. The
endothermicity of the second step indicates that the newly
formed halogen bonds do not lead to a pronounced further
enthalpic stabilization, but that the anion and parts of the
receptor molecules have to be extensively dehydrated for
binding to occur, which is entropically favorable.
This work also involved the evaluation of receptor 62b that
can interact with anions through chalcogen bonds.[215] Receptor
62b behaves similarly as the other receptors, but anion binding
is slightly weaker, which was attributed to detrimental effects of
the methyl groups at the tellurium centers on complex
formation. The comparison of the behavior of the iodotriazolecontaining receptors with that of the corresponding prototriazole analogs is difficult because the prototriazole derivatives
form 1: 1 complexes due to the larger size of their cavities.
Although not within the focus of this review, it should be
noted that chalcogen-bonding was used to mediate the selfassembly of cavitands in water, affording the corresponding
capsules.[216]


7. Dispersion Interactions
Dispersion interactions contribute to the stability of every hostguest complex.[217] They may not be decisive for bringing the
binding partners together but they always become effective
once the complex is formed. The strength of dispersion
interactions scales with the polarizability of the binding partners and the size of the surface areas that come into
contact, which is why complexes in which large hydrophobic
residues are arranged in close proximity especially benefit from
this type of interactions. Dispersion interactions thus add to the
stability of complexes in water in which hydrophobic parts of
the binding partners are pushed together by the hydrophobic
effect. Examples are the complexes of deep cavitands such as
23a[69] (Figure 7) or 37a[218] (Figure 13) with substrates that have
bulky aliphatic residues or long alkyl chains.
Cavitand 37a was shown by Rebek and co-workers to form
complexes with adamantane derivatives such as amantadine
hydrochloride or rimantadine hydrochloride, for example, in
which the bulky adamantyl group of the guests makes contact
with the faces of the aromatic residues that line the inner walls
of the cavitand.[158] In a similar manner, 37a also binds to
surfactants such as dodecyl sulfate or dodecyl phosphocholine
in water.[219] In these cases, the alkyl groups are inserted into
the cavitand cavity with the terminal methyl groups residing at
the bottom and the polar head groups protruding from the
opening. The alkyl chains adopt coiled conformations to
minimize the areas of the chains that are exposed to the solvent
and maximize the contact regions of host and guest. In contrast
to anionic surfactants, alkyltrimethylammonium salts with a
long alkyl chain can bind to cavitands by either including the
ammonium group into the cavity to allow for cation-π
interactions or the hydrophobic alkyl chain. The complexation
of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide by 37a only involved
the latter binding mode, causing the ammonium group to
remain outside the cavity where it interacts with the carboxylate groups along the rim.[158] These results are in line with
those obtained for a series of other cavitands in which the
preferential incorporation of the tert-butyl groups of the
anilinium derivative 33 (Figure 12) was observed,[160] showing
that the hydrophobic effect in water often outcompetes
complex stabilization by cation-π interactions. Unsubstituted
long chain alkanes also bind to 37a in water, but since these
substrates lack functional groups that induce a preferential
inclusion geometry, they freely tumble around inside the
cavity.[220] Cavitand 63 (Figure 23), by contrast, causes included
alkyl chains to adopt U-shaped conformations. The chain ends
of the guest are thus pushed together by complex formation,
allowing the use of 63 to mediate cyclization reactions of
suitable α,ω-difunctionalized substrates.[221] It should be noted
that also CH-π interactions could be made responsible for the
stabilization of an aliphatic guest inside the cavity of these
cavitands. The significantly smaller positive electrostatic potential of aliphatic protons in comparison to protons along the
edges of aromatic rings renders attractive electrostatic interactions in the complexes of alkanes much weaker, however,
and dispersion interactions are therefore probably more
important than CH-π interactions.



The Rebek group also showed that cavitand 64 with an
even deeper cavity than 37a binds small acyclic aliphatic
alcohols and ketones in water whose apolar residues preferentially reside at the cavity bottom.[222] Tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-
dioxane are, for example bound with logKa values of 4.8 and
4.0, respectively. The 1,4-dioxane complex of 64 is thus
comparably stable as that of the naphthotube 49a (Figure 19)
although direct hydrogen bonds between host and guest are
missing. The authors attribute the high stability of these
complexes to the incorporation of water clusters in the upper
part of the cavity with which the guest molecules can interact.
Gibb’s octa acid 23a also binds n-alkanes in water.[69,223] In
this case, the filling of the cavity produces a large hydrophobic
surface at the cavity opening so that the respective complexes
are prone to self-assemble to afford guest-filled capsules.
Depending on the chain length of the alkane, different complex
stoichiometries have been observed, with short alkanes forming
2: 2 receptor/substrate complexes and longer alkanes from noctane onward 2 :1 complexes. Since the cavity size does not
allow the incorporation of alkanes longer than n-nonane in
their extended conformations, these guests adopt coiled
conformations inside the cavity like in the related complexes of
the cavitand 37a. The octa acid 23a has also been used as a
reaction vessel to control the reactivity of certain hydrophobic
guests.[121,224]
Other examples of host-guest complexes in which dispersion interactions are partly responsible for complex formation
are the xenon and radon complexes of cryptophanes. Xenon is
bound by the water-soluble cryptophane 65 (Figure 24) with a
logKa of 4.6 in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 293 K, for
example, in a binding process that is almost equally favored by
enthalpy and entropy.[225] This stability is substantially higher
than the stability of related xenon complexes in organic media,
indicating that complex stability in water is reinforced by the
hydrophobic effect. The stability of the radon complex is
comparably high, suggesting that these complexes could be
suitable for bioimaging or medicinal applications. The extent to which dispersion interactions contribute to
the complexation of noble gases by cucurbiturils was assessed by Nau and co-workers.[226] They determined the stability of the
noble gas complexes of cucurbit[5]uril 26a (Figure 10) whose
cavity is small and fully dewetted in water according to
experimental and computational results. Complex stability
increases with the size of the noble gas from He (logKa=1.9) to
Xe (log Ka=3.9). This order does not correlate with the ease
with which the noble gases are desolvated since Xe has the
highest water solubility in this series. Contributions of dispersion interactions to complex stability could alternatively
explain this trend, which should be strongest for Xe due to its
polarizability. The size of a Xe atom moreover allows it to
approach the inner wall of the cucurbituril cavity at smaller
distances than possible for the other noble gases. Computations showed, however, that dispersion interactions are not very
efficient in the case of the weakly polarizable cucurbiturils. The
dispersion interactions between noble gases and water molecules are, in fact, stronger than those with 26a, causing water
to oppose rather than favor complex formation. The actual
driving force of complex formation turned out to be the gain in
the Gibbs free energy when transferring the noble gas atoms
from cavities in the water matrix, whose formation is energetically costly, to the already dewetted cavities of 26a. The
associated gain in ΔG0 outweighs the loss of the dispersion
interactions between the solutes and water. This work again
demonstrates that the reorganization of the water structure can
be more important for complex formation than the direct
interactions between the binding partners, although water
reorganization, in this case, does not involve the release of
cavity water, but the collapse of the water cavity in which the
substrate was incorporated prior to complex formation.


8. Summary and Outlook
Supramolecular chemistry in water started with the work on
cyclodextrin complexes, long before the term supramolecular
chemistry even existed. A few other receptors were investigated
in water at the early stages of the research field, but substantial
progress came only recently with the development of a wide
variety of receptors with broad substrate spectra. As shown
above, some of these receptors exhibit outstanding substrate
affinities, matching or even surpassing those of analogous
natural systems. Today, water-soluble receptors exist for even
the most difficult substrates, for example, carbohydrates,[196]
with affinities and selectivities sufficiently good to use them in
practical applications. With these developments, the understanding of the principles that govern molecular recognition
processes in water also improved. It has become clear, for
example, that the concept of the “classical” hydrophobic effect
is not or maybe only in rare cases applicable to host-guest
systems. Rather than entropically favored, binding processes in
water are, in fact, often strongly exothermic and can even have
unfavorable entropic terms. Diederich’s concept of the “nonclassical” hydrophobic effect therefore appears to be applicable
not only to the cyclophanes for which it was first introduced,[118]
but to the majority of receptors active in water. The existence
of this technical term does not imply, however that the
underlying principles are also fully understood. Moreover, there
is likely no strict separation between the “classical” and the
“nonclassical” hydrophobic effect but rather a continuous
transition, depending on the structures of the interacting
molecules and their hydration.
Concepts have emerged in recent years that give insights
into the hydration of receptors, especially their cavities,
potentially providing explanations for the pronounced exothermicities of binding processes in water. These concepts take into
account the shape of the binding partners, the size and shape
of the (hydrophobic) surfaces that make contact in the complex,
the release of water molecules from the receptor cavity during
complex formation, substate dehydration, and the degree to
which the receptor cavity is dehydrated prior to substrate
binding. While each of these concepts provides a plausible
explanation for the behavior of the system for which it was
developed, a global understanding of binding processes in
water or even an overarching theory is still missing. These
processes are governed to a large extent by the structural
changes in the water matrix that accompany complex formation, not only in the first solvation shells of the binding partners,
but possibly beyond. The respective dynamic response of the
water molecules is, however, influenced by many aspects and
therefore exceedingly complex. Supramolecular chemists can
contribute to future studies in this field by providing suitable
model systems with which certain aspects can be clarified,
individually or in combination. However, as others have pointed
out already,[127] a fundamental understanding of molecular
recognition processes in water is unlikely to be achieved
without close and mutually beneficial collaborations among
scientists from different disciplines. This understanding will
subsequently help transition from a currently somewhat
empirical search for suitable receptors to a more guided design.
