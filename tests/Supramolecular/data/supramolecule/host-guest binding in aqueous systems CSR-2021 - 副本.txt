Host–guest binding in water, salty water, and
biofluids: general lessons for synthetic,
bio-targeted molecular recognition
Meagan A. Beatty
and Fraser Hof
*
Synthetic molecular recognition systems are increasingly being used to solve applied problems in the life
sciences, and bio-targeted host–guest chemistry has rapidly arisen as a major field of fundamental research.
This tutorial review presents a set of fundamental lessons on how host–guest molecular recognition can be
programmed in water. The review uses informative examples of aqueous host–guest chemistry organized
around generalizable themes and lessons, building towards lessons focused on molecular recognition in salty
solutions and biological fluids. It includes selected examples of macrocyclic host systems that work well, as
well as common pitfalls and how to avoid them. The review closes with a survey of the most important and
inspirational recent advances, which involve host–guest chemistry in living cells and organisms.
Key learning points
(1) There are multiple approaches to introducing water solubility. Each brings with it additional, sometimes unintended, consequences for aggregation and
molecular recognition.
(2) Individual kinds of noncovalent interactions acting alone are rarely suﬃcient to encode molecular recognition in water. The combination of polar
interactions with significant hydrophobic surface area is required, and it is often advantageous when the polar and hydrophobic groups are directly adjacent to
each other. These arrays of interacting groups must be arranged in hosts that are rigid enough to avoid hydrophobic collapse, but flexible enough to
accommodate slightly imperfect shape matching between host and guest.
(3) The impacts of biological solutions are complex and hard to predict. Salts and other biological co-solutes can perturb molecular recognition in multiple
ways. Ionic solutes can change host solubility, induce aggregation (to the benefit or detriment of the host–guest system), compete directly for guest binding
sites, and have other unexpected consequences. Each biological solution requires its own considerations and optimization.
Introduction
Supramolecular chemistry, or chemistry beyond the molecule,
involves the design and study of simple components interacting
through non-covalent bonds to form larger, more complex
assemblies. Nature has mastered the art of directing intricate
molecular assemblies in water, yet supramolecular chemists are
still learning the rules. Within a cell, many types of assemblies
have evolved to carry out the functional requirements of life. All
such assemblies need to form in aqueous solutions that contain
various salts, competitive co-solutes, and other proteins. Chemists
arguably have access to a much wider array of molecular building
blocks, functional groups, and molecular properties than those
routinely used by Nature. However, it remains a major challenge
to create synthetic molecules that are soluble in water and can still
carry out their programmed binding function in the presence of
salts and co-solutes.
One goal that motivates much of supramolecular chemistry
is to mimic Nature’s sophisticated assemblies, while adding
unique characteristics that chemists can program into the
system. Although there are many strategies to develop such
assemblies, one common strategy is to synthesize a concave
‘host’ molecule that contains a recognition motif for a specific
secondary ‘guest’ molecule. Upon recognition of the two compo-
nents, a complex is formed based on the strength of non-covalent
bonds that are shared between each component. The medium
that solvates each component influences the strength of the non-
covalent bonds and in turn the complex. Early supramolecular
systems were almost exclusively studied in organic solvents. Yet
mimicking Nature requires systems to operate in water, which
interacts with the assembling components much diﬀerently than
organic solvents. Computational and supramolecular chemists
have collaborated to model binding interactions through the SAMPL

host–guest blind challenge exercises (https://github.com/sampl
challenges). These have tracked the major improvements in the
field, but have also shown that we are still not able to fully
understand or predict host–guest chemistry in water – especially
where salts are involved. Chemists have reported many systems
that mimic different aspects of natural molecular recognition and
self-assembly, and from this history we can identify key lessons.
Creating a host that predictably binds guests in water, salty
water, or biological fluids remains a major challenge. This tutorial
review is aimed at researchers who are starting in the area of
aqueous host–guest chemistry. The lists of non-covalent interac-
tions and solvation effects that are used to program molecular
recognition of guests (e.g. hydrogen bonds, cation–p interactions,
dispersion forces, electrostatics, the hydrophobic effect, and more)
will be familiar to our target audience, and are well described in
textbooks.1 These will be alluded to without detailed descriptions,
except where necessary for the specific lessons within this tutorial.
Many comprehensive reviews of aqueous molecular recognition
have also been presented elsewhere. One specific goal of this
tutorial review is to present strategies that are used to create hosts
that work in water, and to derive general lessons about those
strategies. Another goal is to teach researchers who are new to the
field about the common challenges, and how to achieve success in
programming their own host–guest systems for operation in salty
aqueous solutions. Our approach starts with introducing the key
concepts and strategies in aqueous host–guest chemistry, showing
illustrative examples, highlighting common pitfalls, and presenting
general lessons. In order to show the most important recent
advances, we will finish with a section covering the relatively
small number of host–guest systems that successfully function
in real biofluids and living systems.
An introduction to the common building blocks
We will focus mainly on an informative subset of macrocyclic
hosts, including cyclophanes, cucurbiturils, and cyclodextrins.
Cyclophanes are macrocycles consisting of an aromatic repeating
unit connected by a bridging component. A major branch of
cyclophanes that has produced many lessons in molecular
recognition is the family known as calix[n]arenes (Fig. 1a); the
calix[4]arene is comprised of phenol units repeated n = 4 times
and bridged by n = 4 methylenes.2 Pillar[n]arenes are relatives
that involve [n] hydroquinone units similarly bridged by [n]
methylenes (Fig. 1b). Other cyclophanes will be introduced as
they arise in the review. To solidify key lessons and highlight
important comparisons, some non-cyclophane hosts such as
cucurbiturils and cyclodextrins will also be included. Briefly,
cucurbit[n]urils (CBs) are rigid hosts that contain glycoluril units
bridged by pairs of methylenes, with the most common members
being CB5–CB8 (Fig. 2a and b). Cucurbit[n]urils feature a hydro-
phobic cavity and two symmetric portals lined by carbonyl oxygen
atoms. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides that
contain a repeating glucose molecule joined by a glycosidic
bond, in which the rims and exterior of the toroid are lined with
hydroxyl groups, and the cavity is lined with hydrophobic CH
groups. As the number of glucose units varies from 6–8, the
common cyclodextrins are called a-CD, b-CD, and c-CD, respec-
tively (Fig. 2c and d). Table 1 provides a broader overview of

common water-soluble hosts and examples of strong-binding
guests for each.
Strategies for introducing water solubility
The first step toward making organic hosts functional in an
aqueous medium is to ensure they are water soluble. Early work
with cyclodextrins, which are inherently water soluble due to
their external-facing hydroxyl groups, demonstrated that hydro-
phobic cavities provide strong binding of organic guests in
aqueous solutions.8 Cyclophanes became interesting targets as
they also provide hydrophobic pockets and can be synthetically
manipulated to form diverse recognition sites. Many cyclo-
phane derivatives have been synthesized with varying charged
functional groups that render them both water-soluble and
eﬃcient at binding guests in water.
A large diversity of charged groups are routinely used. Sulfo-
nates, carboxylates, and phosphonates are commonly employed
to create negatively charged hosts. Ammonium ions, guanidinium
ions, and pyridinium ions are frequently used to create cationic
hosts. Some predictable eﬀects arise: the pillar[5]arene host with
ammonium ions (7, Fig. 3) binds a variety of carboxylate contain-
ing guests; the analog with carboxylates (8) binds a variety of
cationic guests; a mixture of 7 and 8 leads to aggregates of
alternating cationic and anionic host molecules.9
Not all similarly charged groups are created equal. Hosts
bearing multiple groups such as carboxylates, which have pKa
values relatively close to the pH at which the host is operating,
don’t always remain fully charged under experimental conditions.
Hosts with either permanently fixed charges (e.g. quaternary
ammonium ions) or more extreme pKa values (e.g. sulfonates or
sulfates) are more likely to stay charged, soluble, and functional
under all solution pH values. Pillar[5]arenes with pendant sulfate
(9) groups provide an example of how a subtle change in group
can produce large eﬀects (Fig. 3).10 The sulfates in 9 are directly
attached to the macrocycle which creates a very large, local
buildup of charge that is directly lining the binding pocket.
Although the number of potential anionic groups is the same in
8 and 9, the potency of binding for diammonium ions is orders of
magnitude higher (up to 88 000-fold) for 9. This can be attributed
to the flexibility of the linkages to carboxylates, which allow them
to partially collapse onto one another, as well as the very low pKa
of sulfates, which ensures they all remain anionic in spite of their
close proximity to each other.
Neutral polar functional groups are an alternate strategy to
increase water solubility. For example, when polyethylene glycol
tails have been appended to one rim of pillar[5]arenes (10, Fig. 4)
they become water-soluble with the aid of 10% DMSO.11 When
both rims display polyethene glycol tails (11) then the host is
fully soluble in water without the aid of any organic solvent.
Cucurbiturils contain neutral polar carbonyls, but many of these
hosts are only moderately water soluble (20–30 mM for CB5 and
CB7, Fig. 5a and b). Although synthetically modifying these hosts

is not trivial, there exist CBs externally functionalized with
neutral alkyl groups that are more water soluble than their
unfunctionalized counterparts. For example, cyclohexyl-CB5
(Cy5CB5) is water soluble up to B200 mM, while the addition
of two methyl groups on CB7 (Me2CB7) increases its water
solubility to 264 mM (Fig. 5c and d).12–14 These results can’t be
easily understood, because the new groups added are themselves
nonpolar, but their ability to increase water solubility presum-
ably comes from some form of perturbation of stable packing in
the solid state.
The challenges of amphiphilic aggregation and charge
neutralization-induced precipitation
Appending charged functional groups onto an organic host
improves water solubility, but often creates an amphiphilic
species that is prone to aggregation. At certain concentrations
in water, the hydrophobic regions of the host can aggregate into
micelles or other structures, while the charged groups face
outwards and maximize their contacts with water. Often the
hosts’ critical aggregation concentration is determined to
ensure that host–guest binding studies are conducted under
conditions where the host monomer is dominant, instead of
studying guest binding by an ill-defined aggregate. However,
even at low host concentrations the addition of the guest itself
can cause aggregation and precipitation. In one set of examples,
it has been observed that guests like fluorescent dyes, drugs,
surfactants, or proteins form large assemblies with sulfonated
calixarenes. This phenomenon is so general that it was given a
name: ‘‘calixarene-induced aggregation’’ (CIA).2,15,16 In one series
of studies, this potential nuisance was transformed into a strategy
to form stimuli-responsive drug delivery vesicles, as well as other
novel materials. For example, the sulfonated calixarene sCx4
formed a host–guest complex with an amphiphilic guest, 12,
and together they further assembled into a bilayer vesicle that
encapsulated the drug doxorubicin, 13 (Fig. 6).17
In a related set of challenges, precipitation can occur when
charged
solubilizing
groups
encounter
certain
oppositely
charged binding partners that render them eﬀectively neutral
and decrease solubility. For example, tetra-anionic (14) and
tetra-cationic (15) calixarenes form dimeric capsules with each
other in polar organic solvents, driven by complementarity of
electrostatic charges (Fig. 7).18 Yet, this perfect charge comple-
mentarity causes the complex to become water-insoluble and
Fig. 3
Pillar[5]arenes show the varied eﬀects of being functionalized with diﬀerent charged groups. Oppositely charged pillar[5]arenes bearing
ammonium (7) and carboxylate groups (8) prefer guests with diﬀerent charges, and when mixed with each other form bilayers due to electrostatic
interactions between the two kinds of hosts. Pillar[5]arene bearing sulfates (9) binds diammonium ions much more strongly than does 8, in spite of their
similar charges.

precipitate from aqueous solution. This can be overcome
modifying each member of the capsule with diﬀerent solubilizing
groups. For example, by changing the upper-rim sulfonates to
carboxylates (16) while also replacing the lower rim alkyl groups
for glycol-type groups (17) the capsule forms and remains soluble
in water.19 In our own group, we have synthesized unpublished
calixarenes that contain a symmetric arrangement of two anionic
and two cationic functional groups, and we noticed this internal,
symmetric charge neutralization routinely renders the molecules
almost perfectly insoluble in water (or any other solvent). We
have also heard many tales at conferences of work in which the
study of a host–guest system in water was impeded because of
charge-neutralization-induced precipitation. This work is well
known by many, but is almost always unpublished, because of
the significant barriers to characterizing precipitating systems
and to publishing negative results. The presence of counter-ions
from the host, buffer or salt from biological solutions can also
change the solubility of hosts in water. This effect will be
explored more in depth in a later section.
Host topology, shape, hydration and flexibility
We often look to Nature for guidance as to which interactions
are more prevalent and perhaps most important when forming
large assemblies in water. For example, we learn early that
hydrogen bonds are responsible for nucleotide base pairing in
DNA. However, when hydrogen bonds alone stitch a host and a
guest together, assemblies are very sensitive to competition by
water. (The assembly of DNA in fact benefits from a large
hydrophobic driving force that is often omitted from our earliest
lessons on the subject.) Hydrogen bonds alone are rarely enough
to bring host and guest together in pure water.
One exception to this rule about hydrogen bonds helps us to
understand the influence of host topology on guest binding.
Triazole-based hosts can bind Cl through hydrogen bonds
donated by strongly polarized CH bonds. An acyclic host (18,
Fig. 8a) with four triazoles binds very weakly in CD2Cl2
(Kd B 12 mM) and not at all in water.20 A macrocyclic analog
(19, Fig. 8b) binds much more strongly in CD2Cl2 (Kd = 125 nM),
showing how macrocycles (like many hosts in this review) provide
an advantage based on preorganized binding surfaces that sur-
round a guest in two dimensions.21 But the cryptand-like cage, 20,
in Fig. 8c contains 9 C–H derived hydrogen bonds that surround
the Cl in three dimensions. It binds incredibly strongly using
only hydrogen bonds (Kd = 10 aM in wet CD2Cl2) and successfully
binds the anion in water and transfers it into dichloromethane.21
In pure water, a host topology that combines a hydrophobic
binding motif with adjacent polar interactions is often advanta-
geous. The CBs have rigid hydrophobic cavities, and electronega-
tive ureido carbonyl groups tilted inwards towards the Cn axis at
each portal to stabilize polar or positively charged groups. CB7
binds to neutral, hydrophobic guest diamantane (21) strongly in
water (Kd = 250 pM) due to complementary guest shape and
hydrophobicity. The addition of cationic substituents strengthens
the complex as the cationic diammonium analog, 22, binds
35-fold more strongly with CB7 (Kd = 7.1 pM) (Fig. 9).6 However,
the strongest synthetic host–guest complex reported to date is
with CB7 and the trimethylated diammonium analogue, 2 as
more ion–dipole interactions are made due to an improved
alignment of the guest within CB7 (Kd = 1.4 aM).5 The ion–
dipole interactions between the two ammonium groups and the
carbonyls would be impotent in water if presented on their own,
but constitute an effective motif for molecular recognition in
water when preorganized, surrounding the guest, and adjacent
to host and guest hydrophobic elements. The guest itself some-
times provides the hydrophobic component that drives the
assembly of hosts bearing polar functional groups.62
Cation–p interactions readily combine both polar and hydro-
phobic aspects, and as such are especially important in aqueous
host–guest chemistry. Aromatic rings provide an electron-rich

Host–guest charge neutralization can cause aggregation, but that
isn’t necessarily a problem. Calixarene-induced aggregation (CIA) is an
example that has been used to make drug delivery systems.

surface
for
strong
non-covalent
interactions
with
cations
(Fig. 10a). This interaction is amplified with cyclophane hosts,
as there are multiple aromatic rings that create a pocket that is
simultaneously
hydrophobic
(lined
by
aromatic
rings)
and
electron-rich (lined by the p clouds of those rings) (Fig. 10b).22,23
This inherently provides these hosts with selectivity for alkyl
ammonium ion guests, which are themselves both cationic and
hydrophobic. The combined influence of cation–p interactions
and hydrophobicity is supported by a few examples involving the
comparison of related guests. Cyclophane 23 binds cationic
N-methylquinolinium, (24) nearly 80-fold stronger than its neutral,
isosteric counterpart, 4-methylquinoline (25), showing that the
cation–p component is indeed critical for binding (Fig. 10c).
sCx4 binds to N(CH3)4
+ with a dissociation constant of 40 mM
(Fig. 10d) while the more hydrophilic guest, CH3NH3
+, binds much
more weakly (Kd = 1.8 mM) (Fig. 10e), showing that hydrophobicity
also plays an important role.24 This trend extends to biologically
relevant cations, many of which are quite hydrophobic (including
many drugs, neurotransmitters, natural products, and certain
amino acids and peptides). sCx4 is 70 times selective for a greasy
cation, trimethyllysine (Fig. 10f) over the un-methylated counter-
part, lysine (Fig. 10g).25 These trends in binding are commonly
observed, and can’t be explained by the cation–p interaction alone;
the strength of cation–p interactions decrease as the ionic radius of
a guest increases, and should actually favour the smaller cations in
the absence of any hydrophobic contribution.
The hydrophobic eﬀect alone is also strongly dependent on
host topology. An advanced, theoretical understanding of the
hydrophobic eﬀect can be found elsewhere.26,27 Here, we will
discuss the practical (and sometimes unexpected) consequences
of water existing inside host cavities of diﬀerent shapes and sizes.
Because water makes many strong contacts with itself, as
well as charged and polar motifs, it is by exclusion from water
that neutral and non-polar motifs associate. How water inter-
acts with a guest and host before and after complexation is a
major factor in determining how strong the association will be.
The phase separation of oil and water is entropically driven,
which leads to the first explanations of the hydrophobic eﬀect
that one is typically taught. To explain the observed entropic
driving force, it is normally considered that the layer of water
solvating hydrophobic surfaces has fewer degrees of freedom in
comparison to bulk water. The binding of one hydrophobic
surface to another reduces the total surface area that is solvated
by water, which liberates some water back into the bulk and
increases entropy. This model is sometimes called the ‘classical
hydrophobic eﬀect’ (Fig. 11a).

(a) A flexible, foldamer-type host (18) binds weekly to chloride (Kd = 12 mM) while binding is significantly improved with (b) the planar analog 19
(Kd = 125 nM in wet dichloromethane) and the (c) cryptand-like cage 20 (Kd = 10 aM in wet dichloromethane).
Fig. 9
Weak, polar interactions can function in water when adjacent to hydrophobic surfaces. In this example, the ion–dipole interactions provided by
cucurbituril carbonyl portals form a more stable complex with the dicationic guest (22) than with an analogous neutral guest (21). The strongest assembly
reported is between CB7 and 2 and is due to an extensive network of ion–dipole interactions formed with the ureido carbonyls.

Defying the expectations of this simple model, host–guest
binding in water is often also accompanied by a favourable
change in enthalpy. The models that explain these observations,
collectively called the ‘non-classical hydrophobic effect,’ center
on the unusual hydration of small, rigid cavities. Small hosts and
other highly concave surfaces put unusual constraints on their
solvating waters. They can fit, but they can’t form their normal
complement of hydrogen bonds with neighboring waters and
therefore solvate the host cavity poorly or not at all. Guest
binding leads to new host–guest interactions, as well as the
return of cavity-solvating waters back into bulk where more
water–water hydrogen bonds can form, giving in either case a
structural explanation for the observed favorable enthalpies of
binding (Fig. 11b). In recent studies, host cavities have been
observed to be partially dried, or even completely devoid of
water,28 prior to guest binding.29
One set of examples demonstrates how host size is not the
only factor influencing cavity hydration. CB5—the smallest
member of the cucurbituril family—is too small to encapsulate
any water molecules, and few or zero water molecules exist
within the cavity of the free host (Fig. 12).28 This drives the
encapsulation of noble gases in water. Interestingly, hosts like
sCx4 and a-CD can’t bind noble gases as well (or at all), in spite
of their cavity size and chemical functionality being generally
similar to CB5. Both sCx4 and a-CD cavities have conical shapes
that allow at least partial access to solvating waters, giving a
concrete example of how more ‘closed’ topology hosts can have
better guest binding than those that are more ‘open’ to solvation.
The hydration of the guest is also important to consider.
Highly charged guests tend to be strongly hydrated by waters in
the free state, and therefore must pay a large desolvation
penalty in order to bind to host cavities.30 Guests that are very
heteroatom rich, multiply charged, and/or zwitterionic, tend to
bind weakly to hosts of any description. Because of this, most
guests that are targeted by molecular hosts (and indeed almost
all of the guests in this review) combine both polar elements
with hydrophobic elements. This is complementary to a lesson
from earlier in this review, which taught that many hosts
juxtapose polar and nonpolar binding elements in order to
achieve potent guest binding.
If it fits, it sits. Complementary host–guest shape aids in the
formation of strong complexes. While essentially every host–
guest complex holds lessons in shape complementarity, we
choose a pair of cyclophanes, 26 and 27, to teach this lesson.
The two hosts are very similar in chemical functionality, but
vary in cavity shape in a way that favors the binding of different,
closely related guests (Fig. 13).31 Host 26 contains a single
carboxyphenyl linker, creates an overall more rounded binding
pocket, and selectively binds to trimethyllysine (Kme3), an
amino acid with a cationic element that has a complementary,
rounded shape. Host 27 contains a carboxynaphthyl linker,
which creates a more rectangular binding pocket, and instead
selectively binds to asymmetric dimethylarginine (aRme2).
aRme2 is an amino acid with a flatter and more rectangular
cationic side chain. The subtle change in cavity shape increases
the selectivity by B2-fold for aRme2 over Kme3.
Host flexibility is a distinct aspect of shape and topology that
must be understood in order to create strong host–guest
complexes.
As mentioned earlier, preorganized, rigid hosts are favour-
able for guest binding, and also help to encode guest selectivity.
sCx4 provide a rigid, well-defined pocket that binds strongly to
organic cations such as trimethyllysine (Kd = 28 mM) and
lucigenin, LCG (Kd = 35 nM).3,25 Larger, more flexible analogs

sCx6 (Fig. 14a). This ultimately changes the binding topology
and stoichiometry which is reflected in the binding strengths to
the same guests. sCx6 easily interconverts to adopt many confor-
mations. It does not bind strongly with trimethyllysine (Kd = 1.1 mM),
in spite of having more hydrophobic surface area and more
negative charge than sCx4 (Fig. 14b).25 Yet sCx6 has an aﬃnity
for the larger guest lucigenin, LCG (Kd = 5 nM, 1 : 1), which is
similar to that determined for the sCx4–lucigenin complex, and
also displays the ability to form 1 : 2 complexes with this guest
(Kd = 122 nM, Fig. 14c).32 These examples show that it is difficult,
and often inadvisable, to predict the behaviours of highly flexible

molecules increases their entropy, which drives complexation. (b) Cartoon illustration of the enthalpy-driven non-classical hydrophobic effect where it
arises for small host cavities. Water encapsulated in small cavities is constrained such that the cavity is poorly hydrated. Release of these water molecules
upon guest binding leads to new, favourable host–guest contacts, as well as a net increase in hydrogen bonds, either of which can explain favourable
decreases in enthalpy.

The interplay of host topology and solvating waters can influence guest binding. CB5 is the only host from among three similarly sized hosts that
sequesters Xenon from water. CB5 contains an empty de-solvated cavity that is filled perfectly when noble gases complex. a-CD and sCx4 have similar
sizes but diﬀerent topologies, and make favourable interactions with water while not binding Xenon.

flexible hosts as illustrated in the latest SAMPL7 exercise,33 and
we look forward to further advances in this direction.

There are some scenarios in which giving hosts small
degrees of added flexibility provides a clear advantage. If a
rigid host is only a fraction of an Angstrom too small, it will
absolutely refuse to bind a guest. For example, CB7 binds many
ammonium ion guests very strongly but does not bind morphine
at all. Compound 28, which is an acyclic, U-shaped CB analog
binds strongly to morphine (Kd = 2 mM) and also binds a diverse
suite of similar, large guests (Fig. 15).34 The acyclic, cleft-like
host is rigid enough to encode strong binding, but has a slight
flexibility that allows it to accommodate guests that can’t be
retained by its cyclic counterpart. On the extreme, however, it is
well known that the binding pocket of a completely flexible host
will undergo a hydrophobic collapse upon itself when dissolved
in water, which completely turns oﬀguest binding. These
examples show how a balance of rigidity and flexibility can be
advantageous in creating aqueous host systems.
Salts perturb host–guest systems in aqueous solution
Salts are ubiquitous in nature, and often negatively impact
host–guest systems. In order to design hosts that will function
in a biological medium, the system is typically first studied in
buffered water to mimic the pH levels (and sometimes ionic
strength) of the natural solution. The type of salt and the choice
of buffer can drastically change how the host behaves.
Hard metal cations can act as competitive guests for polar
sites in host cavities. The counter-cation in most anionic
buﬀers (phosphate, citrate, etc.) is often overlooked, but in fact
can bind directly to hosts that have anionic solubilizing groups
or other electron-rich motifs. sCx4 is best known to bind with
cationic ammonium guests, but also binds Na+ with Kd = 5.3 mM.35
Although this is a weaker binding event than with other ammonium
guests, if one considers that the buﬀer concentration is often as
high as 150 mM (see below), then nearly every host can be occupied
by Na+ (Fig. 16a). The addition of salt or acid (H3O+) helps increase
the solubility of cucurbiturils in water because the cation binds to
the electronegative ureido carbonyls. Extensive mechanistic studies
have shown that Na+ and other simple cations can bind to both
carbonyl portals and modulate guest encapsulation. This either
weakens the complex (when the cation acts as a competitive guest),
or increases the strength of host–guest complex (when the cation
directly enhances binding). For example, CB7 binds with a ditopic
guest, 29, via the phenyl or naphthyl ring but prefers the latter at low

Host flexibility facilitates an induced fit for larger guests. (a) Acyclic
cucurbituril, 28, can flex to bind with large guests like morphine whereas
(b) cyclic cucurbiturils are inflexible and bind poorly to morphine.

concentrations of Na+.36 At high concentrations of Na+, the cation
acts as a competitor and weakens the naphthyl inclusion, flipping
the host’s preferences by acting as a stabilizing cap for the phenyl
inclusion complex (Fig. 16b).
To avoid unfavourable interactions of salt with various
hosts, a low buﬀer concentration is ideal. It must be noted
that buﬀers should always be at least 10-fold more concentrated
than the ionizable species they are buﬀering, in order to ensure
suﬃcient buﬀering capacity to maintain a constant pH value.
However, when translating these systems to real biological
solutions, it is hard to escape the 100’s of mM concentrations
of various ions that exist in Nature.
Soft, polarizable ions can act as direct competitors for hydro-
phobic cavities. Anions such as I, ClO4
, and SCN are common
examples that associate with hydrophobic surfaces, and are even
capable of outcompeting guests for the binding pocket. For
example, the host–guest complex of 5 and 30 weakens in the
presence of increasing concentrations of NaI, NaClO4, and NaSCN
(Fig. 17) NMR studies directly show that perchlorate is encapsu-
lated within the 5, preventing 30 from binding.37 This effect
becomes more dramatic when anions increase further in size
and polarizability, such as in the case of borate clusters and
polyoxometalates.38
High concentrations of salt can induce precipitation when
ions condense onto charged hosts. Earlier, we described how
charged hosts can precipitate upon the association of an
oppositely charged guest. Host solubility in water can also be
aﬀected by salt when the buﬀer or solution counterions associate
and neutralize the charge on the host (Fig. 18). Many examples of
such negative results go unreported, but one useful example can
teach the lesson. sCx4 and its corresponding thia-calixarene
derivative (31) were used to encapsulate ketone and alcohol
guests in water, prior to a 100-fold excess of NaCl being added
to neutralize the hosts, precipitate the host–guest complexes,
and allow their isolation (Fig. 18).39 The authors reported that
there was a clear preference for 31 to capture guests and salt-out
more readily than sCx4, despite both bearing four sulfonates
along the upper rim and having similar structures and charged
groups. This shows that it is not simple to predict how any given
class of host will behave in a certain concentration of a salt.
When problems are encountered, we recommend changing the
identities of buffers and supporting solutes, because subtle
changes can solve precipitation problems in unexpected ways.
In some cases, the presence of salts can stop short of inducing
complete precipitation, and instead induce host aggregation or
assembly in a way that can be beneficial for their function.
Several of the hosts in the next sections are examples of this kind
of outcome.
Exemplary systems that operate in the presence of salts and
buﬀers
An understanding of how hosts behave in salty water aids in the
design of supramolecular systems that carry out their functions in
a biological context. While there are many examples of hosts that
bind with peptides or proteins, lipids and/or act as bio-active
surfactants, and that act as bio-compatible reaction vessels, this
discussion will focus on a series of anionic hosts that act as
sensors, as well as some key relatives that extend the lesson.
Sensors are particularly informative for the current discussion,
as the supramolecular systems that target biological analytes need
to generate a detectable output in water, while using binding
mechanisms that are resistant to salts and other biological solutes.
Transforming a host into a chemosensor requires the inte-
gration of a reporter motif or molecule that signals when an
analyte has been bound by the host. Dyes are common reporters
as their optical properties can be sensitive to the environment
and to the presence of other molecules. There are various
photophysical mechanisms that modulate the response of dyes,
Fig. 17
The association between host 5 and guest 30 is perturbed by hydrophobic, polarizable anions such as ClO4
, which directly compete for the
hydrophobic binding pocket.
Fig. 18
Millimolar concentrations of salt neutralize the charge on highly
charged hosts and can render them insoluble in water. 31 and sCx4 are
similar, but 31 precipitates from solution much more readily upon addition
of NaCl.

and one common strategy is through indicator displacement
assays (IDAs), as illustrated in Fig. 19. The dye/indicator is
encapsulated by the host which creates an ‘‘analyte absent’’
optical state. Once an analyte is present, it displaces the indicator
into the bulk water, which induces another optical state of
‘‘analyte present’’.40 Some examples of hosts exist in which the
hosts have been structurally modified to include this dye molecule
tethered covalently to their structure. However, many more supra-
molecular sensors simply use an added, external dye molecule to
avoid the synthetic challenges of creating dye-integrated hosts.
Although these sensors are often easily constructed, they suﬀer
from the same challenges as any aqueous host–guest system—
chemosensors that target biological analytes must work in salty
water. Salts can not only act as competitors (see above), but can also
directly perturb the photophysical properties of the indicators.
In spite of these challenges, some examples of supramolecular
sensors teach key lessons about compatible buﬀers and how to use
salt eﬀects as an advantage. The two following examples show how
the eﬀects of buﬀer and salt can be considered predictively and/or
empirically in order to provide supramolecular chemosensors that
can operate in complex aqueous solutions.
In the first example, sCx4 was used to detect the product
formation of an enzymatic reaction in real-time when combined
with lucigenin (LCG) as the dye component in an indicator
displacement assay.41 sCx4 binds to LCG and quenches its
emission (Fig. 20). One sCx4–LCG assay monitored LCG’s
fluorescence increase as the dye was displaced from the sCx4
cavity by a trimethyllysine-containing peptide, which was the
product of an enzymatic methylation reaction. A glycine buffer
(5 mM, pH 10) avoids the presence of large amounts of Na+ and/
or Cl that might have been present in other typical buffers.41 As
discussed previously, sCx4 binds with Na+ directly in a way that
can compete with guest recognition. More importantly, Cl and
other halides bind to LCG directly and quench its fluorescence.
A diﬀerent example shows how salt eﬀects can provide a
functional advantage. In this case a deep-walled cavitand, 32,
was paired with a trimethylammonium–fluorescein conjugate,
33, as the displaceable indicator and was used to detect the
progress of an enzymatic demethylation reaction (Fig. 21).42 In
this case the IDA works as a turn-off sensor. Host 32 first binds
the trimethyllysine-containing substrate peptide, leaving indicator
33 uncomplexed and emissive. Once the enzyme creates the
unmethylated peptide, indicator 33 associates with the host.
However, 33 does not participate in a typical indicator displace-
ment scheme when encapsulated by 32. Instead, the amphiphilic
dye-host complex forms micelles in which the dye is quenched by
aggregation effects. The complex assembly strength was tested in
the presence of various salts (e.g. NaCl and NaI). Each salt had a
unique influence on the sensor’s aggregation, which in turn
affected the sensitivity of the assay.
One final set of examples teaches about a surprising, yet
seemingly general motif for salt-tolerant assemblies. Hosts that
combine a significant amount of negative charge along with
hydrophobic recognition motifs are often able to assemble with
similar partners in salty solutions, and even be promoted by
salt. The Gibb cavitand (34) self-assembles into dimers around
hydrophobic guests despite forming a complex with overall 16
charge. However, with the addition of various salts, the assembly

Indicator displacement assay (IDA) is used to detect analytes by displacement of a quenched dye. Added salt can negatively aﬀect IDAs in
multiple ways, including by acting as a competitor for the host or by quenching the emission of the dye (see main text).
Fig. 20
sCx4 and lucigenin (LCG) are used as a conventional IDA sensor to monitor a methyltransferase reaction, giving a turn-on fluorescence
response when trimethyllysine is formed by the enzymatic reaction. The use of low NaCl concentrations minimizes potentially deleterious salt eﬀects.

changes to a tetrameric species (4: 2) with an overall 32 charge.
The highly charged assembly is presumably stabilized by the
binding of cations to anionic groups in order to reduce the
overall repulsion among monomers (Fig. 22a).43 A family of
calixarenes each functionalized with single, rigid, hydrophobic
arms display a related behaviour, forming anionic dimers in
aqueous solutions that get stronger upon addition of added salt
(Fig. 22b).44 The operating principle is the same in both cases:
hydrophobic aggregation is balanced against the mutual repul-
sion between like charges in each monomer; salts act to reduce
the mutual electrostatic repulsion and strengthen the hydrophobic
eﬀect; the strength of each assembly is increased in the presence of
salt; the overall negative charge is enough to keep the well-ordered
assemblies in solution.
Systems that function in real biological media
The goal for many water-compatible supramolecular systems is to
operate in real biological solutions, which can be both complex
and unpredictable. Supramolecular hosts oﬀer selective and
potent recognition sites that mimic those of biomolecules in
Nature. However, an additional challenge for these supramolecu-
lar tools is to operate in solutions that are even more complex and
less controlled than the salty, buﬀered aqueous solutions that
have been discussed above. Biofluids such as serum, saliva, and
urine contain a mixture of salts, proteins, and organic metabolites
that vary in concentrations over time and between individuals.
This complexity and heterogeneity is further amplified in cells
and whole organisms. Examples of biofluid-compatible chemo-
sensors and medicinally relevant systems that operate in cells and

whole organisms are discussed below. It is generally harder to
teach general lessons from such diverse material. The purpose of
this section is to inspire tutorial readers with examples of the
achievements of host–guest chemistry under the most complex
and challenging of biological conditions.
Chemosensors that function in biofluids
Many chemosensors that function in biofluids operate within a
sensor array to overcome the diﬃculty of achieving highly
specific analyte sensing in competitive solutions. Often, a single
chemosensor is not enough to selectively target one analyte in a
complex mixture that contains a number of structurally similar
analytes and biological co-solutes. Instead of re-designing a
chemosensor to improve selectivity, the original IDA can be
expanded to form an array of partially promiscuous, cross-
reactive chemosensors that detect many analytes but to diﬀerent
extents. In this approach, popularized by Anslyn and since
thoroughly explored my many others,45 the output is a unique
pattern or fingerprint for a given analyte that is subsequently
simplified and visualized through chemometric analyses in
order to distinguish diﬀerent analytes (Fig. 23).
In one illustrative example that works in a real biofluid, a
guanidinium-modified calix[5]arene, 36, was able to detect an
ovarian cancer marker, lysophosphatidic acid (37), at nM con-
centrations in plasma through the displacement of fluorescein,
38 (Fig. 24).46 Despite high selectivity over most other co-solutes,
ATP was found to be a major competitor. An array of similar
calixarenes (39) and diﬀerent dyes (40) were used in combination
with chemometrics to robustly distinguish ATP from the targeted
biomarker, 37.
Non-covalent IDA’s often dissociate in the presence of salt,
rendering them unable to operate in biofluids. One strategy to
circumvent this problem is to covalently attach the dye to the
host molecule. In one example, a fluorescent dye berberine was
synthetically linked to CB7 to create the sensor 41 (Fig. 25). The

tethered sensor was superior to a non-covalent CB7-berberine
complex in sequestering and sensing the drug amantadine (42)
in salted buﬀers, saliva and urine.47
Dye-labeled hosts can also function in non-IDA sensing modes.
In one example, a library of dye-conjugated calix[4]pyrroles
detected and discriminated between diﬀerent carboxylate-based
drugs in urine (Fig. 26).48 Once a drug is bound to the pyrroles,
the dye, which is conjugated directly to the binding motif, turns
on through an intramolecular partial charge transfer. The authors
initially found that each calix[4]pyrrole chemosensor bound more
strongly to competitive biological anions like Cl and H2PO4

than with benzoate, a compound that is structurally similar to the
tested drugs. However, the library of calix[4]pyrroles in combi-
nation of chemometrics was able to detect and successfully
discriminate between the carboxylate drugs in urine.
Host aggregation can also be used to create functional sensors.
An array of calix[4]arene-based chemosensors detects and discri-
minates between diﬀerent illicit drugs in saliva. The previously
mentioned salt-tolerant calixarene dimers (Fig. 27) inspired the
invention of chemosensors called DimerDyes that replace the
pendant hydrophobic group with environment-sensitive merocya-
nine dyes. These novel chemosensors operate as a DimerDye
Disassembly Assay, in which they first form self-quenched homo-
dimers, and then operate as sensors when the homodimers
disassemble in the presence of competing hydrophobic, cationic
guests in order to induce a turn-on fluorescence response. To
achieve successful discrimination of closely related drugs and
their metabolites in human saliva, sixteen DimerDyes were made
and tested in parallel, leading to the selection of five sensors that
could achieve the desired sensing tasks. The combination of the
selected five DimerDyes and chemometric tools were used to
successfully detect and discriminate between illicit drugs such
as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and their respec-
tive metabolites at low mM concentrations in human saliva.49 In
another, elaborate example of aggregation-triggered sensing, cavi-
tand 32 (see Fig. 21) was combined with two diﬀerent dyes and
heavy metals that collectively caused several distinct aggregation
states. The changes in aggregation upon addition of tetrahydro-
cannabinol (43, Fig. 28) were able to be read out as distinct
changes in optical responses in either human saliva or urine.50
Hosts that operate in whole cells and cell lysates
Some hosts can function individually in whole cells and cell lysates,
in spite of the many salts, metabolites and other biomolecules that
exist in living systems. In one example, a host was used as a
biomolecular enrichment tool that functioned in a cell lysate to
‘‘fish out’’ a protein from a complex mixture (Fig. 29).51 An
acetamidocalix[4]arene, 44, was conjugated to an agarose bead
and mixed with HeLa cell lysate. The goal was to allow the

functionality. It was able to be detected and identified in saliva and in urine

dyes, and various heavy metals.

calixarene to form complexes with a few strong protein partners
from the thousands of proteins contained in the cancerous cell.
‘‘Hit’’ proteins were identified after a pull-down, cleavage from
the bead, and proteomics analysis. Subsequent re-testing con-
firmed the biological activity of the calixarene on its newly
discovered protein target.
Cells have lipid bilayers and other barriers that prevent foreign
substances from entering, yet there are some supramolecular
hosts that can successfully pass through membranes. While
highly charged hosts often fail to enter cells, the pre-formed
complex of sCx4 and lucigenin dye (LCG) penetrated and worked
as an IDA sensor within live Chinese hamster ovary cells and
fibroblasts (Fig. 30).52 The sensing abilities were strongly aﬀected
by
the
chloride-containing
cell
medium
(binding
strength
decreased 100-fold, quenching eﬃciency decreased 5-fold) yet
the diﬀerential response was enough to detect guests such as
acetylcholine. There are a small but growing number of such
reports, in which a host can enter a cell along with the guest to
which it is bound. The actual mechanism behind the cellular
entry of sCx4 remains unknown. But the ability of oppositely
charged, somewhat lipophilic host–guest complexes to enter cells
is reminiscent of the way that cationic lipids can bind to DNA and
serve as transfection agents.
CB7s bind with N-terminal phenylalanine residues on pro-
teins such as insulin with sub-micromolar aﬃnities (Fig. 31a).53
Many proteins involved in protein misfolding diseases such as
Alzheimer’s and amyloidosis contain hydrophobic residues, like
phenylalanine, that promote unfolding, refolding, and sequential
formation of fibrils and amyloids. The fibrils of amyloidogenic
proteins like insulin can be toxic to cells. In a promising proof-of-
concept for a new kind of therapeutic approach, CB7 was able to
bind insulin through its N-terminal phenylalanine residue,
decrease insulin fibrillization, and reduce the toxicity of insulin
fibrils to living cells in a standard cell culture medium (Fig. 31b).54
Supramolecular systems that function in whole organisms

the host must be both tolerant of co-solutes and also behave well

pharmacologically. Many common host macrocycles seem to be
relatively inert in the body, and examples of these hosts can act as
drug carriers, bioimaging agents, disease inhibitors, and even
reversal agents for other drugs.
Many examples of host–guest chemistry operating success-
fully in whole organisms involve hosts acting as drug reversal
agents. Many hosts including sCx4, cyclodextrins, cyclic and
acyclic cucurbiturils form strong complexes with various illicit,
harmful, or toxic drugs in water with association constants
ranging from 0.1 mM to 10 nM.34 Compound 45 was successful
at binding methamphetamine in rats, reducing drug-induced
hyperlocomotion, and also remove the neuromuscular blockade
agent rocuronium (1) from mice, restoring normal muscular
control after an anaesthetic procedure (Fig. 32).34,56 This follows
on from a currently approved cyclodextrin drug called Sugam-
madex, which also removes rocuronium and restores muscular
activity in humans after surgical neuromuscular blockade.56,57
An acyclic CB analogue, 28, was also successfully able to bind
fentanyl, significantly improving respiratory impairment and
other side effects.55 sCx4 has been shown to reverse drug toxicity
by, for example, lowering the concentration of a toxic herbicide,
paraquat (4), rescuing animals in a rat model of herbicide
poisoning.58 An increasing number of such examples exist for
pillar[n]arenes, calix[n]arenes, CB-analogs, and cyclodextrins. An
almost universal aspect of these studies is the focus on drugs
(guests) that are both cationic and hydrophobic, and that are
therefore well suited to being bound by anionic hosts.
Hosts can also act as carriers for beneficial drugs and
therapies.4,59 Cyclodextrins have long been used as excipients
that solubilize and stabilize drugs in the bloodstream. We will
present here recent examples in which a novel host releases the
drug at the site of disease due to an environmental change. For
example, carboxylatopillar[6]arene (3) transports toxic cancer
drugs, oxaliplatin-C10 (46) and doxorubicin (13) by forming
both a pH-dependent host–guest complex and vesicles, to
tumor cells in mice (Fig. 33).60 The release of the drugs is
triggered by a pH drop in cancer tissue, causing oxaliplatin-C10
to lose affinity for protonated 3.
In another strategy, a host can encapsulate a reactive mole-
cule in vivo, rendering it temporarily inert. A specific biomarker
localized at a diseased site can then displace the reactive guest
from the host in order to kill the diseased cells. An example of
this uses a modified calixarene, 47, which forms a strong
complex with a photosensitizer (40) that renders it photoche-
mically inert (Fig. 34).61 The large abundance of ATP present in
certain tumour cells displaces 40, and when free 40 is irradiated
by a localized light source it creates highly toxic singlet oxygen.
Excitingly, this approach was shown to kill tumor cells in mice
with good cell-type selectivity.

Conclusion and outlook
The field of host–guest chemistry has evolved dramatically from its
origins in fundamental research. Successful complexation in water,
once a frontier of discovery for the basic sciences, is now regularly
achieved. The creative application of host–guest chemistry offers
solutions to diverse kinds of problems in the life sciences, and this
approach is already starting to make major impacts in biomedical
research and in medicine. We hope that this practically oriented
tutorial review both encourages and enables newcomers to
contribute to this exciting field.

Biomarker displacement for phototherapy. An amphiphilic calix[5]arene, 47, binds and quenches a photosensitizer, 40, forming stable micelles
that remain inert in mice. The high concentrations of ATP in tumour cells bind to the calixarene and displace 40. Irradiation of the tissues containing the
now-released photosensitizer creates highly reactive singlet oxygen, selectively killing cancer cells.
