ABSTRACT: Molecular recognition in water using macrocyclic synthetic receptors
constitutes a vibrant and timely research area of supramolecular chemistry. Pioneering
examples on the topic date back to the 1980s. The investigated model systems and the
results derived from them are key for furthering our understanding of the remarkable
properties exhibited by proteins: high binding aﬃnity, superior binding selectivity, and
extreme catalytic performance. Dissecting the diﬀerent eﬀects contributing to the proteins’
properties is severely limited owing to its complex nature. Molecular recognition in water is
also involved in other appreciated areas such as self-assembly, drug discovery, and
supramolecular catalysis. The development of all these research areas entails a deep
understanding of the molecular recognition events occurring in aqueous media. In this
review, we cover the past three decades of molecular recognition studies of neutral and
charged, polar and nonpolar organic substrates and ions using selected artiﬁcial receptors
soluble in water. We brieﬂy discuss the intermolecular forces involved in the reversible
binding of the substrates, as well as the hydrophobic and Hofmeister eﬀects operating in
aqueous solution. We examine, from an interdisciplinary perspective, the design and development of eﬀective water-soluble synthetic
receptors based on cyclic, oligo-cyclic, and concave-shaped architectures. We also include selected examples of self-assembled water-
soluble synthetic receptors. The catalytic performance of some of the presented receptors is also described. The latter process also
deals with molecular recognition and energetic stabilization, but instead of binding ground-state species, the targets become elusive
counterparts: transition states and other high-energy intermediates.

the early 1980s. The investigated model systems and the
results derived from them provided answers to our under-
standing of the large values observed for proteins’ binding
aﬃnity, selectivity, and catalytic performance.1,2 Nevertheless,
the aim of these investigations was and still is the desire to fully
understand noncovalent interactions in water, both in ground-
state (molecular recognition) and transition-state (catalysis)
complexes.
Protein binding pockets are constructed by aliphatic and/or
aromatic groups of amino acid residues, which build up a
hydrophobic environment having cleft or cavity-like shape.
The polar and charged groups of other amino acid residues are
buried in these proteins’ hydrophobic cavities. This arrange-
ment minimizes the solvation of the latter with water
molecules of the bulk solution. The solvation of polar groups
with a discrete number of water molecules seems to be key for
their involvement in supramolecular functions like molecular
recognition, reactivity modulation, and reaction catalysis.3 The
use of synthetic receptors in molecular recognition studies in
water overcomes some limitations encountered in the direct
study of biological counterparts. For example, the study of the
binding processes by spectroscopic techniques becomes
simpliﬁed and can be performed in a wider range of
temperatures to allow a detailed thermodynamic analysis of
complexation.4
Molecular recognition in water is also appreciated in areas of
research not directly involving synthetic receptors, such as
molecular self-assembly, drug discovery, and supramolecular
catalysis taking place also in water. Furthermore, the
applications of water-soluble supramolecular systems in
nanotechnology and biomedicine1 are realizing the importance
of understanding the noncovalent interactions at play and in
particular the role exerted by the hydrophobic eﬀect (HE).
The physical and chemical properties of water5−10 oﬀer both
opportunities and challenges for molecular recognition. The
free energy gain that produces the formation of stable host−
guest complexes in water results from the contribution of two
main components: First, the favorable and newly formed
intermolecular interactions established between host and guest
upon complex formation. This component is akin to gas phase
binding. Second are the advantageous intermolecular inter-
actions of the interfacial water molecules solvating the complex
compared to those for the separate binding partners. The
second energy component is referred as the HE.11 The
diﬀerent intermolecular interactions involved in the two energy
components share in common their electrostatic (e.g.,
hydrogen bonds) and dispersive (van der Waals, London
forces, etc.) origins. The HE is important in regulating binding
aﬃnity, especially for binding sites with nonpolar cavities and/
or substrates having hydrophobic residues. On the other hand,
the intermolecular interactions between host and guest that are
established in the complex, especially the ones that are
electrostatic in nature, play important roles in dictating binding
selectivity and complex geometry.12 The thermodynamic
characterization and the physical nature of the noncovalent
intermolecular forces driving complexation both in solution
and in the gas phase will be discussed in some detail in section
2. In this section, we include two subsections to brieﬂy discuss
the properties of the HE and the Hofmeister eﬀect, aka the
salting eﬀect. Both phenomena are strongly rooted on energy
diﬀerences of noncovalent interactions established by the
interfacial layer of solvating water molecules in diﬀerent states
of a binding system.
The solvation of ions and neutral molecules depends on the
properties of liquid water.8,9 Ions are strongly solvated by water
molecules. Cations are solvated through cation−dipole
interactions involving the electron density of the lone pairs
of the oxygen atom of water, whereas anions interact with the
partially positively charged hydrogen atoms of water molecules.
As a result, the charge of the ions is signiﬁcantly screened by
the aqueous medium.10 Water also interacts with polar neutral
molecules by establishing a network of hydrogen bonds. In
contrast, nonpolar molecules are poorly solvated and tend to
aggregate.
Synthetic molecular receptors must meet common require-
ments to eﬃciently bind molecules and ions in water.13 The
receptors must be soluble in water at concentrations that allow
spectroscopic and/or calorimetric studies. This limits the
number of building blocks available for their syntheses. In
general, ionizable or charged groups are incorporated at the
periphery of the receptor’s scaﬀold to ensure water solubility
and prevent aggregation.14 The architecture of the receptor
must be relatively rigid, from a conformational point of view, in
order to avoid the hydrophobic collapse of the binding pocket,
which translates into the loss of binding properties. The
binding site of the receptor must be complementary in terms of
size, shape, and function to the substrate characteristics in
order to ensure optimal intermolecular interactions, high
aﬃnity, and selectivity.15 The fulﬁllment of these requirements
demands special considerations when polar groups are
involved. The binding event must also compensate the high
dielectric constant (ε = 78.5 at 278 K) and the strong
hydrogen-bonding ability of water. The main features of
synthetic and biological receptors (i.e., proteins) are
summarized in Table 1.16
Molecules may exhibit unusual chemical and physical
properties when conﬁned in small spaces. In water, the
modiﬁcation of chemical reactivity of guests bound in well-
deﬁned, hydrophobic cavities of synthetic receptors has been
amply demonstrated.17,18 Therefore, synthetic receptors might
mimic enzymatic cavities and function as molecular vessels to
perform chemical reactions.
The accuracy of theoretical calculations in predicting
binding aﬃnity values of small molecular weight molecules
to biological receptors is of great interest for rational drug
design and fast hit-to-lead optimization. However, biological
systems pose multiple challenges (slow binding dynamics,
ionization changes, etc.), limiting a direct comparison of
experimental data to the theoretical estimates. The water-
soluble host−guest systems developed by the groups of Isaacs
(section 3.3) and Gibb (section 4.2) have emerged as a
practical and eﬀective alternative providing experimental

theoretical methods within the series of blind predictive
challenges of the Statistical Assessment of Modeling of
Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) exercise.19,20
Unfortunately, the agreement between the experimentally
determined kinetic and thermodynamic data for the complex-
ation processes involving synthetic receptors in water with
those obtained from quantum chemical methods or molecular
dynamic calculations is, to say the least, suboptimal.6,19−21
This fact is somewhat surprising owing to the huge
development experienced in the last decades in computational
methods and hardware. Nevertheless, this limitation is a clear
indication of the diﬃculties encountered in modeling binding
processes in water, which relate to the important role played by
the solvent molecules in the solvation/desolvation processes
that are concomitant to the binding event.11,22,23
We are aware of the diﬃculties encountered in calculating
accurate energy minimized structures for the supramolecular
complexes formed in water, as well as the limitations associated
with related calculations performed in the gas phase. Thus, the
energy minimized structures (MM3) of the simpliﬁed/pruned
supramolecular complexes that are included throughout the
review simply aim at illustrating its three-dimensional nature
and the existence of a size and shape complementarity between
host and guest. We consider that the provided representation
oﬀers a superior visualization of the complexes than the
corresponding line-drawing structures. We refrain to disclose
energy values or draw conclusions in relation to their
thermodynamic stabilities. We know that the provided
structures might not correspond exactly with those calculated
in solution using either ﬁrst-principles or MD empirical
calculations. Nevertheless, we consider them to be illustrative
of reality.
In this review, we overview the past three decades of
molecular recognition studies in water using macrocyclic
synthetic receptors. We restrain ourselves to the use of discrete
and homogeneous synthetic receptors and the complexation of
polar and nonpolar organic molecules, as well as small ions. We
brieﬂy comment on the nature and strength of the
intermolecular forces (section 2) driving the reversible
formation of host−guest complexes in gas phase and in
solution. We mention the hydrophobic (section 2.1) and
Hofmeister eﬀects (section 2.2) owing to their important roles
in nonpolar binding in water solution. Both eﬀects are based
on energy diﬀerences between intermolecular interactions.
Recently, the topics mentioned in sections 2.1 and 2.2 were
covered in more detail in the book “Supramolecular Chemistry
in Water”, edited by Kubik, and we refer the readers to the
corresponding chapter.11 We review the developments
achieved in the design of eﬀective receptors in water, using
cyclic, oligocyclic, and concave-shaped unimolecular architec-
tures (covalent receptors) (sections 3-5). Self-assembled
water-soluble receptors (section 6), i.e., metal coordination
cages and noncovalent capsules, are also mentioned. We
highlight selected examples of synthetic hosts capable of
mediating/catalyzing chemical transformations. We are aware
that we have not included all relevant examples, and we want
to apologize to the authors for our biased selection. Noncyclic
(clips and tweezers), planar (porphyrins), and boronic acid-
based receptors are out of the scope of this review, and the
reader is addressed to other literature references that cover the
topics.4,13,15,24−26 Likewise, we will not dwell in synthetic
water-soluble receptors based exclusively on molecular units
derived from nature, i.e., saccharides for cyclodextrins13,27,28
and amino acids for cyclopeptides.13,29 However, we will
brieﬂy mention cyclodextrins by comparing their binding
aﬃnities with those of the synthetic receptors explicitly
described in the text.
2. ELECTROSTATIC AND DISPERSION
INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS
The magnitude of the binding constants determined for 1:1
complexes of synthetic receptors in water lies in the range of
1−1017 M−1.3 The binding aﬃnity values are typically
enhanced by increasing the nonpolar contacts (i.e., number
and surface area) between the cavity and the bound guest.
Moreover, the combination of additional host−guest inter-
molecular interactions10 with those inducing the hydrophobic
eﬀect has evolved as a sensible approach in the design of
synthetic receptors able to eﬃciently bind polar substrates in
water solution30,31 (see section 5).
The nature of the intermolecular interactions can be mainly
electrostatic, meaning that their establishment does not require
a reorganization of charges or electron density in the
interacting atoms or molecules. Alternatively, intermolecular
interactions may have a signiﬁcant dispersive character, which
do require a temporary reorganization of at least one of the
electron densities of the interacting partners. Polarizability
greatly inﬂuences dispersive interactions. In any case, the
dissection of intermolecular interactions in their electrostatic
and dispersive terms is not trivial, neither from an experimental
nor a theoretical approximation.
Diﬀerent binding motifs or intermolecular forces work
synergistically in the establishment of a host−guest complex in
order to produce high levels of aﬃnity and selectivity.32,33
Owing to the reduced polarizability of water, dispersion forces
are supposed to be more important between two organic
substrates forming a complex than in the separate water-
solvated counterparts.34 However, this dogma has been
recently challenged in the case of “soft” liquid−vapor like

interfaces of water molecules. These are the type of interfaces
present in the ﬁrst water solvation layer of large molecules (see
Hydrophobic Eﬀect in section 2.1).
Coulombic or ionic interactions are one type of electrostatic
forces. They relate to the attractive or repulsive interaction
established between two charged species (charge−charge)
(Figure 1a). Because of the high dielectric constant of water
and its superior abilities for charge solvation (charge−dipole
interaction), ion-pairing of ions featuring large ionic charge
density tends to be quite weak in this solvent (i.e., just
considering the ε value of water, the interaction between two
oppositely monocharged particles is 1% of that in the gas
phase). A salt-bridge is deﬁned by a combination of two
interactions: hydrogen-bonding reinforced with ionic-bonding
(Figure 1b). The free energy of a water-solvated salt-bridge
was estimated to be ca. 4.2 kJ·mol−1.35 In water, a salt-bridge or
ion-pair interaction is mainly driven by entropy (ΔS > 0) and
opposed by enthalpy (ΔH > 0).36 This interaction type was
successfully applied by Schmuck in the binding of oxoanions
(e.g., carboxylates, phosphates, etc.) in water using acyclic acyl
guanidinium receptors.4,10,37
As additional example of the above, the complexation of
anions and anionic molecules in water using synthetic
receptors was ﬁrst approached by the use of positively charged
receptors (ionic interaction). For example, Schmidtchen et al.
reported tetrahedral hosts bearing quaternary ammonium
groups at their vertices for the recognition of halide anions.38,39
The host’s counteranions were properly selected (large and
polarizable) in order to minimize interferences with the
binding of the targeted anionic guest.40,41
Unfortunately, positively charged anion receptors tend to be
poorly selective because they rely mainly on ionic interactions,
which are nondirectional. The inclusion of hydrogen bond
donor groups in the cationic scaﬀolds of the anion receptors
improved their selectivity. More recently, Kubik et al. reported
neutral receptors (cyclopeptides) exclusively based on hydro-
gen-bonding interactions in order to overcome the limitations
of charged hosts.29,42
However, complexes stabilized exclusively by solvent-
exposed hydrogen-bonding interactions display a reduced
thermodynamic stability in water owing to the competitive
hydrogen-bonding nature of the latter (Figure 1c). Therefore,
the eﬃcient formation of hydrogen-bonding complexes in
water requires the protection of the polar groups in deep and
hydrophobic binding sites that limit the access of bulk water
molecules43 (see section 5). Hydrophobic concave binding
pockets can be obtained by designing unimolecular receptors,
i.e. cavitands (see section 4), or by self-assembly processes of
multiple copies of nonpolar molecules, i.e. metallo-cages and
hydrogen-bonded capsules (see section 6). The extensive use
of aromatic panels in shaping the hydrophobic and concave
cavities of the receptors creates diﬃculties for the placement of
converging polar groups in them. In nature, polar peptide
residues converge in the hydrophobic interior of the protein
binding sites and are able to establish eﬃcient hydrogen-
bonding interactions with the bound substrates.32,33
In contrast to hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds (XB) are not
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by solvent polarity.4 This characteristic
hints to the existence of additional forces than electrostatics in
their formation (i.e., dispersive, charge-transfer, etc.). However,
halogen bonds are relatively weak in both polar and nonpolar
solvents (Figure 1d). The XB donor contains a halogen atom
featuring an electrophilic region (σ-hole), whereas the XB
acceptor is an electron-donating group in another or the same
molecule. The strength of a XB depends on the properties of
both binding partners. For example, iodinated compounds
form stronger halogen bonds than brominated counterparts,
and those are better than chlorinated derivatives. Additionally,
electron-withdrawing substituents on the XB donor increases
the σ-hole potential, reinforcing the halogen-bonding inter-
action. Likewise, electron-donating groups in the XB acceptor
assist the thermodynamic stabilization of the halogen bond.
Formation of eﬃcient halogen bonds requires an angle close to
linearity (165−180°) along the R−X···A interactions. The XB
donor−acceptor distance in a strong interaction is below the
sum of the van der Waals radii of the atoms involved. Halogen-
bonding interactions are driven by enthalpy and opposed by
entropy.44
In analogy to halogen-bonding interactions, chalcogen
bonding is deﬁned as the interaction between a nucleophile
(lone-pair), such as an oxygen or nitrogen atom, and an
electron-deﬁcient chalcogen atom (σ-hole), such as sulfur,
selenium, or tellurium (Figure 1e). Chalcogen bonds are
directional, i.e., they require angles close to 180°, and are not
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by solvent polarity.45,46
Aromatic interactions are widely encountered in nature.47,48
Cations are attracted by aromatic rings due to the negative
electrostatic potential of the π-surface of the planar aromatic
component.49 The cation−π interaction (see section 3.1) can
contribute to enhance the free energy of binding in more than
8.4 kJ·mol−1, both in synthetic and natural complexes.4 For
example, ca. 25% of L-tryptophan amino acids in nature
establish cation−π interactions with positively charged
L-
arginine or
L-lysine residues. The cation−π interaction is
formed primarily by an electrostatic component, even though
dispersion interactions might be also involved.50
On the contrary, anion−π interactions are usually repulsive
owing to the unfavorable interaction of the negatively charged
ion and the π-electron cloud of the aromatic ring. Attractive
anion−π interactions can be established when the aromatic
component features a positive quadrupole or is polarizable. For
example, the free energy of anion−π interactions was
quantiﬁed to be ca. 10 kJ·mol−1 in the binding of oxoanions
(e.g., sulfate and selenate) with a nitroso-amine-pyrimidine
receptor in water solution, containing 0.1 M ammonium
chloride.51 In this particular example, the anion−π interaction
was entropically favorable, probably due to the required water
desolvation of the nonpolar aromatic surface and the anion on
complex formation. Examples of enthalpically driven anion−π
interactions were reported, but they involved the use of organic
solvents.52
Aromatic π−π stacking and CH−π interactions have both
electrostatic and dispersion contributions.34 On the one hand,
the binding geometry of two aromatic groups can be edge-to-
face, oﬀset stacked, or face−face stacked44 (Figure 1f). On the
other hand, CH−π interactions are directional, featuring an
angle between 140° and 180° (center ring···H−C) and a
distance of 2.3−2.9 Å. The strength of the CH−π interaction
increases with the acidity of the CH bond and the increase in
the electron density of the aromatic ring4 (Figure 1g). In
general, CH−π interactions contribute less than 10.5 kJ·mol−1
to the binding free energy.53 These interactions are particularly
interesting in carbohydrate binding,54,55 in which the
association constants of the complexes between monosacchar-
ides and proteins are in the order of 103−104 M−1 (three CH
groups face the aromatic ring).56

Amide groups are widely present in nature, and they form
the backbone of proteins. They establish π−π and NH−π
interactions with aromatic groups. Interestingly, the π−π
binding geometry between amides and aromatic heterocycles
involves the antiparallel alignment of their dipole moments44
(Figure 1h). Furthermore, the oxygen atom of the carbonyl
group of amides can be involved in hydrogen bonds with
hydroxyl groups, among other hydrogen bond donors, in
water.57 Most likely, the NHCO···HO interaction is mainly
driven by entropy due to the desolvation of the binding polar
groups. Other heteroatoms, such as sulfur, interact favorably
with π-systems through dispersion interactions. The sulfur−π
interaction accounts for up to 2.1 kJ·mol−1 in the stability of
folded proteins.34
Finally, orthogonal dipolar interactions, such as CO···C
O and C−X···CO (CO/X···CO, 90° angle), were
involved in the stabilization of protein’s secondary structure44
(Figure 1i). These interaction modes can be considered as
examples of the currently fashionable π-hole bonding.58
2.1. Hydrophobic Eﬀect
The hydrophobic eﬀect (HE) is mainly present in nonpolar
binding processes occurring in water, such as protein folding,
ligand-protein complex formation, and membrane self-
assembly, as well as in those involving synthetic host−guest
and self-assembly systems.59,60 Although the basic properties
deﬁning the HE are qualitatively understood, there are many
features of this ubiquitous phenomenon that remain to be fully
explained and quantiﬁed.11,61 The HE favors apolar binding
(aggregation) and results from the free energy diﬀerence
between: (1) the combination of the strong hydrogen-bonding
of the water molecules in the solvating layer, the weak
dispersion interactions that they establish with the aggregating
nonpolar molecules and other noncovalent forces present in
the aggregate, versus (2) the weaker hydrogen-bonding and
dispersion interactions of the interfacial water molecules
solvating the separate free species (vide infra). Thus, the HE
should not be considered a separate intermolecular interaction
(see above for a classiﬁcation of intermolecular interactions)
but a consequence of the energy diﬀerence in the
intermolecular interactions established during the water
solvation of the free and the aggregated species. Compared
to polar and protic organic solvents, water has the highest
cohesive intermolecular interactions (stronger hydrogen
bonds) and possesses the lowest molecular polarizability.
Taken together, these two eﬀects make water the best solvent
to promote apolar complexation, however, not beyond the
expected level based on its physical properties.62,63
The ﬁrst attempt of a detailed theory explaining the low
aﬃnity of nonpolar groups for water was provided by Frank
and Evans.64 The authors described the clustering of water
molecules into microscopic “icebergs” around nonpolar
molecules and discussed the entropic consequences of the
arrangements. A few years later, Kauzmann coined the term
“hydrophobic bonding” to describe the water-mediated process
that induces the spontaneous tendency to aggregation of
nonpolar groups of proteins in order to minimize their exposed
surface area.65 These forays into the origins of the HE revealed
a perplexing aspect of the phenomenon: the strength of the
interaction between the nonpolar groups seemed not to be
related to their physicochemical properties but to those of the
aqueous media.66 Back then and even now, scientists are used
to thinking that interactions between residues and groups are
due to their own physicochemical properties rather than those
established with the solvent medium. However, and as
mentioned above, the cohesive nature of the intermolecular
interactions of water molecules is believed to be the main one
responsible for the HE. In addition, as pointed out by
Chandler,61 the dispersion interactions established between the
solutes and the water molecules of the interfacial layer,3,14
which were considered not to be very important owing to the
reduced polarizability of water molecules, are gaining
considerable importance in recent years. The HE provides an
impetus to nonpolar binding in water but lacks of speciﬁc and
directional characteristics.10 Studies on simple synthetic
models are necessary to further gain understanding of the
HE operating in more complex synthetic systems and in
biology.6 Hydrophobicity is a multifaceted phenomenon that
reveals diﬀerent characteristics depending on the solutes’ size,
shape, and strength of the direct attractive interactions
established between them.61 Water-mediated hydrophobic
interactions are directly linked to hydrophobic hydration.67
To a ﬁrst approximation, the free energy for assembling a
hydrophobic complex in water is the diﬀerence between the
hydration free energy of each component in their free state and
the hydration free energy of the assembled state.
Chandler pointed out that the physics that govern
hydrophobicity at macroscopic and molecular size scales are
fundamentally diﬀerent.61 At the molecular scale, the hydration
of a large solute or aggregate (>1 nm of girth) makes it
impossible for adjacent water molecules to maintain a
complete hydrogen-bonding network as those in the bulk. In
response to this loss of hydrogen bonds, water molecules tend
to move away from the large solute and form an interface akin
to that between liquid and vapor. In this case, the solute is said
to be “dry” or “dewetted”, and the density of the water
interface is reduced compared to that of the bulk.
On the contrary, for small hydrophobic solutes, the water
density immediately adjacent to the solute’s surface is larger
than that of the bulk. Solvating water molecules adopt a similar
hydrogen-bonding pattern than that of the liquid but
experiencing signiﬁcant reordering. Under these circumstances,
the small solute is said to be “wet”. The consideration on water
solvation based on solutes’ size adds to the growing evidence
indicating that the HE only becomes signiﬁcant if the nonpolar
area buried in the complex or aggregate is larger than ∼1 nm2.
On the basis of all the above, the tendency of hydrophobic
aggregation can be traced down, to a ﬁrst instance, to the
dependence of hydrophobic solvation on solute’s size. Thus,
when small solutes aggregate to form a hydrophobic unit with
a volume to surface ratio large enough, the overall free energy
of the aggregate’s solvation might be lower than that of the
individual solutes. This eﬀect constitutes a favorable driving
force for aggregation.
The driving forces of hydrophobic aggregation increase with
temperature. This observation is used to imply that the process
is entropically driven. However, in reality and as indicated by
Chandler, the process is driven by the diﬀerence in free
energies of the entropically dominated solvation of small
molecules and the enthalpically controlled hydration of larger
ones.61 It is worth mentioning here, as already anticipated
above, that dispersion (van der Waals and London forces),
being negligible on the structure of dense ﬂuids, might become
rather important in “soft” liquid−vapor like interfaces of water
molecules. As brieﬂy mentioned above, hydrophobic inter-
actions can be driven either by entropy, enthalpy, or both. A

temperature-dependent enthalpy−entropy crossover has been
observed in the hydration processes of nonpolar solutes as well
as in protein folding and binding processes in water.
At ambient temperature, an increase in entropy and a
reduced or nonexistent enthalpy gain are distinctive attributes
associated with binding processes driven by the so-called
“classical” HE. This thermodynamic signature is related to
water desolvation of small nonpolar surfaces and concomitant
assembly of aggregates with poorly deﬁned structures in terms
of size (polydisperse aggregates) and/or binding geometry. On
the contrary, the so-called “nonclassical” HE is associated with
an enthalpically driven binding process (see examples by
Diederich et al. and Dougherty et al. in section 3.1). Also in
this regard, the presence of “high-energy” water molecules in
the cucurbit[n]uril’s cavity (see section 3.3) has been used as
an alternative concept to explain the high enthalpic
contribution observed in the hydrophobic host−guest binding
processes.68,69 In literature, the term “high-energy” has been
used indistinctly to refer to the free energy or to the enthalpy
component of the water molecules included in nonpolar
binding sites. Nevertheless, at equilibrium, the free energies of
all water molecules, either present in interfacial solvation layers
or in the bulk solution are identical.67 Thus, the thermody-
namic signature of the “nonclassical” hydrophobic eﬀect
should not be assigned to inexistent diﬀerences in free energy
between interfacial and bulk water molecules. Instead, it should
be explained by the gain in free energy for the intermolecular
interactions of the interfacial water molecules solvating the
complex, i.e., favored hydrogen-bonding network and superior
dispersion (van der Waals forces) compared to those for the
free solvated counterparts.4 Also, the temperature-dependent
changes of enthalpy and entropy for binding processes
occurring in water reduce the utility of the classiﬁcation of
the event as driven by the “classical” and “nonclassical” HE.11
Independently of the thermodynamic signatures of binding
processes in water, if hydrophobic interactions are involved,
one typically observes large changes in heat capacity with
temperature. The heat capacity change for a binding process
(ΔCp
b) is a thermodynamic measure that quantiﬁes the
dependence of the enthalpy with the temperature at constant
pressure (see examples of Diederich et al. and Dougherty et al.
in section 3.1 and section 7). The molecular HE relies on
shielding areas of nonpolar surfaces from directly interacting
with water molecules. Thus, the magnitude of ΔCp
b has been
related to the amount of involved surface area, while its
negative sign has been assigned to the preferential burial of
nonpolar surfaces on complex formation.70 Nevertheless, the
foundation of the burial of nonpolar surfaces, which occurs on
complex formation, and the water reorganization processes is
not universally accepted.71 This physical interpretation of the
molecular HE indirectly assigns a larger heat capacity value to
the water molecules in the bulk with respect to those
interacting with nonpolar surfaces. Although the magnitude
of ΔCp
b should not be used to identify the role of the HE in
the binding process, its sizable temperature dependence may
be considered a more convincing evidence.11 With some
exceptions, including cyclodextrins72 and cyclophanes, the
eﬀect of the temperature in the thermodynamics of the binding
processes of synthetic receptors in water has not been
extensively studied.49
In water, the temperature dependence of enthalpy is
typically reﬂected in parallel changes of entropy, owing to
the almost temperature invariable magnitude of the free
energies of binding and protein folding processes in water.73
This trade-oﬀof enthalpy and entropy results in the well-
known phenomenon of enthalpy−entropy compensation
(EEC) eﬀect,6,74 which might be simply due to the basic
thermodynamic laws.75 Although enthalpy−entropy compen-
sation eﬀects were assigned as a general property of weak
molecular interactions, i.e., ΔG ∼0,76 they are also observed in
binding processes having large free energy magnitudes, i.e.,
protein−substrate binding or host−guest complexes in water.
The molecular basis of the diﬀerent thermodynamic
signatures determined for binding processes in water driven
by the HE is rather complex. It combines the noncovalent
interactions present in the host−guest complex with the
signiﬁcant reorganization of the water molecules. This
reorganization is caused by the desolvation of the free
components and the solvation of the resulting complex.77−79
The enthalpy−entropy compensation (EEC) eﬀect is also
responsible for the temperature-dependent enthalpy−entropy
crossovers referred above, which is characteristic of certain
folding and binding processes occurring in water.
The water desolvation energy of a solute’s surface depends
not only on its size (surface and volume) (vide supra) but also
on its shape. On the one hand, the desolvation of small convex
surfaces is accompanied by favorable entropy change at room
temperature. On the other hand, the desolvation of concave
surfaces is associated with favorable enthalpy change.8 Note
that concave surfaces are more hydrophobic than their ﬂat
counterparts owing to the signiﬁcant reduction in the number
of hydrogen bonds experienced by the included water
molecule/s compared to the bulk counterparts7 (Figure 2).
Consequently, when the included water molecules are released
to the bulk, in response to the complexation of a nonpolar
substrate, its reorganization is expected to provide a gain in
enthalpy.40 This enthalpy gain is expected to reduce as the
number of water molecules included in the cavity
increases.44,69 This process has been related to a reduction in
binding aﬃnity. Nevertheless, diﬀerences in binding free
energies should not be exclusively assigned to energy
diﬀerences between interfacial and bulk water molecules.80
Most likely, the interaction energy of the interfacial water
molecules in the complex compared to that of the free
substrates is also signiﬁcantly modiﬁed.
It is worthy to note here that very similar nonpolar concave
binding sites of synthetic cavitands, only diﬀering in the
presence and position of methyl groups encircling their open
portal, showed a diverse range of water solvation.80
Remarkably, the adequate orientation of the methyl groups
induced the “drying” of the receptor’s nonpolar binding
pocket. This result demonstrated that the receptor’s apolar
binding site can serve to template water cavitation. It also
oﬀered an alternative to control the complexation strength of

molecule is shown along with the hydrogen bonds to donor (D) or

nonpolar guests in water, which is not related to the release of
water molecules included in the receptor’s cavity. As the
authors pointed out, whether a nonpolar binding pocket is
preferentially “wet” or “dry” depends on the subtle balance
between weak attractive dispersion interactions and the limited
number of hydrogen bonds of the included water molecules
compared with the formation of a water−air interface at the
receptor’s binding site. Guest complexation was enhanced in
the “dry” state of the receptor owing to the lack of competition
with water solvation. In any case and owing to the small size of
water, the solvation of nonpolar binding pockets is better
considered as a matter of extent: weakly or strongly hydrated.
As mentioned above, the term “high-energy” when referring
to the water molecules included in concave nonpolar binding
sites, i.e., cucurbit[n]urils,68,69 is arguable. First, and as already
stated above, the thermodynamic signature of binding events
in water must not be rationalized based on inexistent
diﬀerences in free energy between interfacial/included water
molecules and its bulk counterparts.67 Second, as discussed in
the previous paragraphs, the fact that “dry” or “weakly
hydrated” nonpolar cavities exist in liquid water demonstrates
that water solvation occurs only if it is energetically
favorable.80,81 Third, water molecules included in nonpolar
binding pockets are simply very bad guests and their
substitution by an organic substrate might produce a free
energy of binding as favorable as in the gas phase.
Nevertheless, this controversy found in literature shows that
additional work is needed to fully understand solvation eﬀects.
The shape of the receptor’s binding site is also very
important to minimize hydrogen-bonding interactions of the
included polar groups with water molecules in the bulk. In
silico calculations of nonpolar cavities featuring a radius lower
than 1 nm revealed that they are expected to be empty (“dry”
or “weakly hydrated”) most of the time.82 Nevertheless, water
molecules can be found in small nonpolar cavities if polar
groups able to get involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions
are present. In contrast, large hydrophobic cavities lacking of
polar groups are generally occupied by water molecules
(“wet”).4 Exceptions to the rule are known. Computational
studies revealed the existence of large “dry” or “weakly
hydrated” regions in protein binding sites.33 Large nonpolar
aromatic cavities of synthetic receptors displaying a “reduced
hydration” were also recently described and mentioned
above.80 Water molecules included in aromatic cavities may
be stabilized by favorable OH−π interactions. The type and
arrangement of the buried functional groups need to be
specially considered when designing water-soluble synthetic
receptors featuring polar binding sites.69,83,84
2.2. Hofmeister Eﬀect
The addition of salts (ion-pairs) to aqueous solutions, aka
salting, is known to inﬂuence solute’s properties. In this sense,
more than 125 years ago, the Hofmeister eﬀect provided very
early evidence on how salts inﬂuenced the solubility of solutes.
For reasons that are still not entirely clear but may be related
to their diﬀerent modes of solvation by water molecules (see
section 1), the Hofmeister eﬀect is much more prominent with
anions than with cations. Anions and cations are traditionally
sorted in Hofmeister series according to their eﬀect on “salting-
out” and “salting-in” solutes, i.e., increase in salt concentration
induces solute precipitation and solute’s solubility is increased
with salt addition. The implication of the salting phenomenon
is more general than solubility modulation of solutes in water.
The salting problem is also of signiﬁcance in altering binding/
aggregation processes occurring in water, i.e., recognition
between proteins, stability of their secondary and tertiary
structures, phase boundaries of micellar solutions and lipid
layer, aﬃnity values for host−guest systems, etc.8
The salting phenomenon was described to be not solute-
dependent, leading to the classiﬁcation and ordering of anions/
cations in the well-known “Hofmeister series”. Even today, the
mechanism of the Hofmeister eﬀect (salting eﬀect) is not
entirely clear. The original explanations invoked changes in the
structure of water. This led to the naming of some ions as
kosmotropes (induce order in the structure of water) and
other as chaotropes (induce disorder in the structure of water).
More recent studies and theories consider alternative
explanations that involve the existence of speciﬁc interactions
of solutes with the anions as well as their impact on the water
structure of their ﬁrst or second solvation shells, but not
beyond, because in water electrostatic interactions are strongly
shielded.6,77 These ﬁndings made that within the water
sciences community the terms “kosmotrope” and “chaotrope”
are rapidly becoming archaic. Moreover, the terms “kosmo-
trope” and “chaotrope” are associated not only to the salting
eﬀect produced by the ions but also to the original and
misleading explanation of the observed eﬀect. We advocate for
the use of the terms “salting-in” and “salting-out” in naming the
ions properties.
“Salting-out” anions feature small sizes and high charge
densities such as ﬂuoride and sulfate. They are strongly
hydrated, increase solvent surface tension, and decrease
solubility of nonpolar molecules (strengthen the HE). In
contrast, “salting-in” anions are large and charge-delocalized
such as iodide and perchlorate. They display reduced hydration
energies, are more prone to interact with other solutes and
increase the solubility of nonpolar molecules in water (weaken
the HE) (Figure 3).43,77,85
Reports on the interactions of certain “salting-in” anions
with hydrophobic surfaces and cavities of synthetic and natural
receptors in water resulted in the coining of the term
“chaotropic eﬀect”. This term was considered as a driving
force being orthogonal to the HE.85 However, the impetus to
binding is mainly provided by the HE itself. That is, the
diﬀerence between the hydration free energies of the complex
and the free binding partners. The “chaotropic eﬀect” is
particularly eﬃcient for very large anions with low ionic charge
density, which are not well solvated by water and extend the
classical Hofmeister scale at the “salting-in” side (Figure 3).
These anions are designated as “super chaotropic” species (e.g.,
borate clusters and polyoxometalates) corresponding to
“salting-in” anions displaying a diﬀuse charge.85 We consider
that the coining of the term “chaotropic eﬀect” adds confusion
to the already complex area of host−guest binding in water and
we suggest that it should be considered simply as the “salting-
in” eﬀect exerted by anions featuring a large charge diﬀusion
owing to its extended surface.

the precipitation of solutes from water.

Using synthetic host−guest systems, Gibb’s group has put a
lot of eﬀort in understanding the Hofmeister eﬀect (salting
eﬀect) on binding aﬃnity.77 To this end, a water-soluble deep-
cavity cavitand bearing external carboxylic acid groups was
used as model system (see section 4.2). The binding of
adamantane carboxylic acid to the receptor’s cavity involved
the deep inclusion of the adamantane residue (nonpolar
section). The addition of “salting-out” anions favored binding,
whereas “salting-in” anions had the opposite eﬀect. These
results were rationalized in terms of the Hofmeister eﬀect and
the competitive binding of the “salting-in” anions in the
hydrophobic cavity. Further studies evidenced that the
observed Hofmeister eﬀect was not only related to the
inclusion of the “salting-in” anions into the receptor’s cavity
but also to the concomitant binding of salt cations to the
peripheral carboxylate groups.4 Other examples of salting
eﬀects are described in the studies of Schneider et al. with a
positively charged cyclophane (section 3.1) and those of Davis
et al. using a “temple” receptor (section 5.1).
In the same vein, the binding of large “salting-in” anions
featuring a diﬀuse charge was studied by Nau and co-workers
using γ-cyclodextrin.85 The association constants of the
resulting complexes were in the order of 103−106 M−1.
Interestingly, the binding processes were thermodynamically
characterized as enthalpically driven and opposed by entropy.
In agreement with Gibb’s ﬁndings, the obtained results
conﬁrmed that “salting-in” anions, which are weakly solvated
by water, bind eﬃciently in the hydrophobic cavities of
cyclodextrins that are also badly solvated by water.40
The fact that “salting-in” anions are poorly solvated by water
may also be responsible of the “reverse” Hofmeister eﬀect.11
Typically, the interaction of “salting-in” anions with nonpolar
groups or solutes induces an increase in solubility (vide supra).
However, in certain cases, the same “salting-in” anions can
induce the precipitation of the solute. On the one hand, this
dual behavior presents a problem to the theory explaining the
Hofmeister eﬀect simply based on the modiﬁcation of water
structure. On the other hand, it provides strong support to the
idea that the Hofmeister eﬀect for “salting-in” anions involves a
direct interaction of the anion with the solute. In this case, the
unexpected reduction of solubility is related to the ion-pairing
of the anion with positively charged groups of the solute. It
seems that the “reverse” Hofmeister eﬀect is at the heart of the
chloride selection as countercation of small ammonium groups
soluble in water. The corresponding perchlorate salt displays a
reduced water solubility owing to stronger ion-pairing.
3. CYCLIC AND OLIGOCYCLIC COVALENT
RECEPTORS FEATURING A HYDROPHOBIC CAVITY
In this section, we discuss water-soluble synthetic receptors
featuring monocyclic or bicyclic architectures having a covalent
connectivity of aromatic units. The binding site provided by
these cyclic covalent hosts (aka unimolecular hosts) is mainly
hydrophobic.
3.1. Cyclophanes
Cyclophanes are synthetic molecular receptors formed by
aromatic units linked together with alkyl or aryl spacers. The
structure of cyclophanes oﬀers a hydrophobic cavity commonly
open to the bulk solution at its two opposite ends. Ionizable or
charged groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amines, ammonium
cations, etc.) are appended to the cyclophanes’ scaﬀolds to
impart their solubility in water and minimize aggregation
tendency.15,86 On the basis of these features, cyclophanes are
good candidates to study the binding of nonpolar molecules or
residues in water. Cyclophanes incorporating polar groups in
the interior of their hydrophobic cavities, i.e., inwardly directed
toward them, are rare.69
The ﬁrst examples of molecular recognition in water using
cyclophane receptors were reported by Koga et al. in 1980.87
Cyclophane 1 is based on two rigid diphenylmethane units
connected by two butane-1,4-diamine spacers (Figure 4).

Cyclophane 1 is soluble in water at pH < 2 owing to the
protonation of its secondary amines. The authors demon-
strated that, in the solid state, 1 formed a 1:1 inclusion
complex with 1,2,4,5-tetra-methylbenzene. The receptor
adopted a rhomboid-like conformation (ca. 7.9 × 6.5 Å2) to
accommodate the benzene derivative in its aromatic cavity.
The authors also investigated the binding properties of 1 in
acidic aqueous solution. For example, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-
sulfonate potassium salt 2 (Figure 5) was used as guest.
Compound 2 featured emission properties and, therefore,
titration experiments were performed using ﬂuorescence
spectroscopy. The incremental addition of tetra-ammonium
cyclophane [1+4H]4+ in acidic water to a solution of sulfonate
2−, also in acidic water, induced the gradual enhancement of
the guest’s emission band intensity. The ﬁt of the obtained
titration data to a 1:1 binding model using a linear regression
(Benesi−Hildebrand plot) returned a remarkable binding
constant value of Ka (2−⊂[1+4H]4+) = 6.3 × 103 M−1.
However, the geometry of the 2−⊂[1+4H]4+ complex was not
determined in solution by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
After these initial studies, Koga et al. reported the binding
studies of 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene 3 (Figure 5) with
cyclophane 1 in DCl/D2O solution (pD = 1.2) using 1H
NMR spectroscopy.88 The incremental addition of receptor
[1+4H]4+ to a water solution of 3 induced upﬁeld shifts to the
proton signals of the guest. Simultaneously, the proton signals
of the butyl spacers of [1+4H]4+ also moved upﬁeld, whereas
the protons of the methylene bridges of the two para-phenyl
units did not experience appreciable chemical shift changes.
Taken together, these observations supported the inclusion of
3 in the aromatic cavity of [1+4H]4+ in acidic water solution.
The protons of bound 3 and those of the aliphatic chains of
bound [1+4H]4+ moved upﬁeld owing to the shielding eﬀect
exerted by the aromatic rings present in the respective binding
partners. The chemical exchange process between the free and
the bound components of the 3⊂[1+4H]4+ complex showed
fast exchange dynamics on the 1H NMR chemical shift time
scale. This fast chemical exchange is related to the existence of
two opposite open portals in the cyclophane’s structure,
allowing the rapid formation and dissociation of the inclusion
complex. The association constant of the 3⊂[1+4H]4+
complex was estimated to be 2.8 × 103 M−1. Interestingly, a
sensible binding geometry for the complex was derived from
the analysis of the chemical shift changes experienced by the
protons of both host and guest. The naphthalene derivative 3
was bound in a pseudoaxial orientation in the aromatic cavity
of [1+4H]4+. In this binding geometry, the two hydroxyl
groups of guest 3 were exposed to the bulk aqueous solution
(Figure 6).
Cyclophane 1 and its octa-N-methylammonium analogue
were used in the binding studies of a series of charged aromatic
guests.89−91 The obtained results revealed that the anionic
guests were bound more strongly than the cationic derivatives,
Ka (anionic guest ⊂cyclophane) > 10 × Ka (cationic guest ⊂
cyclophane). This ﬁnding indicated that the formation of 1:1
inclusion complexes derived from cyclophane [1+4H]4+ did
not only follow the size and shape complementary principles,
but it also took into account the charge complementarity
between binding partners.
The length and conformational rigidity of the spacers in 1
were also modiﬁed to tune the dimensions and hydrophobicity
of the cyclophane’s cavity.89,92 Thus, the incorporation of
cyclohexyl units in the spacers boosted the binding constant of
1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate 2−to 5.0 × 105 M−1
(increase of 2 orders of magnitude with respect to the parent
receptor [1+4H]4+). In the latter complex, bound 2−adopted
an equatorial orientation, burying completely the naphthalene
group in the receptor’s cavity.
Additional water-solubilizing groups were appended to the
spacers of the bis-(diphenylmethane) cyclophane 1 aiming at
improving receptor’s solubility. Kikuchi, Murakami, and co-
workers incorporated four L-aspartate residues to the four
nitrogen atoms of 1.93,94 The attached amino acids allowed the
modulation of the overall charge of the receptor at will. The
carboxylic acids of the aspartate residues were ionized at basic
pH, leading to anionic cyclophanes. On the contrary,
protonation of the primary amines of the aspartates at acidic
pH gave the cationic counterparts. Using this cyclophane
derivative, the authors observed that depending on the overall
charge of the host (z = +4 or z = −4), the electrostatic
interactions impacted by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude on the
thermodynamic stabilities determined for the 1:1 complexes
with mono- and dicharged guests (anionic and cationic).
On the basis of the above, Schneider et al. synthesized the
bis-(diphenylmethane) cyclophane receptor 4 bearing hexyl
chains as spacers and four quaternary ammonium groups95
(Figure 4). The cavity size of tetra-cationic 44+ could
accommodate purine bases, such as adenine and their

corresponding nucleosides and nucleotides, establishing 1:1
complexes. For example, the energy minimized structure of the
complex of adenosine monophosphate, AMP2−⊂44+, shows the
adenine fragment included in the aromatic cavity of 44+ and the
ribose unit placed near one of the portals of the macrocyclic
binding site (Figure 7 and Table 3). The phosphate group of
the guest is exposed to the bulk aqueous solution, even though
it can establish electrostatic interactions with the cationic
ammonium groups of the receptor. Cyclophane 44+ displayed
high binding selectivity for adenine derivatives in water.
Cyclophane 44+ was also employed as model system to study
the eﬀect of salt addition (salting eﬀect) in the binding of
naphthalene 2-carboxylate.96,97 An increase in the concen-
tration of NaCl resulted in a moderate reduction of binding
aﬃnity (from Ka = 5.97 × 103 M−1, I = 0.09, to 1.96 × 103
M−1, I = 0.48) and in the observation of a linear relationship
between log Ka and the Debye−Hückel term f(I) (log Ka = log
Ka° + mI1/2/(1 + I1/2), where I is the ionic strength). The
calculated slope of the linear regression (m) was −1.45. This
value was signiﬁcantly lower than the one expected (m =
−4.07) if the host (z = +4), guest (z = −1) and 1:1 complex (z
= +3) were treated as normal ions. The addition of NaCl, in
the range of concentrations used, had a reduced impact on the
HE toward binding as could be expected for an anion located
in the middle of the Hofmeister series (see section 2.2). In any
case, the authors concluded that the surprising linear Debye−
Hückel correlation may be used as an approximate, empirical
indicator of the level of the importance of the Coulombic
interactions for the stabilization of the supramolecular host−
guest complexes in water. Thus, for complexes in which
Coulombic or charge−charge interactions dominate binding
(see electrostatic interactions in section 2), slope values (m) of
the corresponding linear Debye−Hückel correlations in the
range of −4 to −3 should be expected.
Water-solubilizing groups were also attached as substituents
in the diphenylmethane walls of the cyclophanes. For example,
Schrader, Finocchiaro, and co-workers designed cyclophane 5
having four monoethyl phosphonic acid groups, as lithium
salts, and bearing two ortho-substituted pyridines as spacers98
(Figure 4). This receptor bound the methyl ester of
diprotonated L-lysine 62+ (Figure 5) through the formation
of charge-assisted hydrogen bonds (see section 2) between the
ammonium groups of the guest and the negatively charged
monoethyl phosphonates of the receptor 54−. The two
protonated ammonium groups of 62+ could be also involved
in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the nitrogen atom of
the pyridine residues of receptor 54−. The binding constant for
the 62+⊂54−complex was determined to be Ka = 1.2 × 103 M−1
in water. This is a remarkable value considering that the
complex is mainly stabilized through electrostatic interactions.
Diederich et al. functionalized the methylene bridges of bis-
(diphenylmethane) cyclophanes with spiro-piperidinium units
and replaced the amino groups of the spacers by ether
functions,99 7−10 (Figure 4). These structural modiﬁcations
allowed the placement of the quaternary ammonium groups far
from the receptor’s cavity, minimizing their possible eﬀects on
the binding event. It is worth mentioning that, in the solid
state, the cavity of spiro-piperidinium cyclophanes was
occupied by two water molecules. In water solution, the bis-
piperidinium cyclophane 72+ featured a critical micellar
concentration (cmc) of 1.6 × 10−4 M, which limited the
implementation of 1H NMR spectroscopy titrations. Never-
theless, the binding constants of the complexes derived from
72+ were determined by solid−liquid and liquid−liquid
extraction methods as well as ﬂuorescence spectroscopy
titrations. Dicationic cyclophane 72+ formed 1:1 inclusion
complexes with aromatic guests. As in the previous examples
reported by Koga and co-workers, the cyclophane complexes
were stabilized by the HE, and the establishment of π−π,
CH−π, and long-range Coulombic and dispersion interactions
(i.e., van der Waals) (see section 2). For example, the complex
of 6-[(4-methylphenyl)-amino]-2-naphthalenesulfonate 11−
(Figure 5) and cyclophane 72+ featured an association constant
value of Ka = 4.3 × 103 M−1 in water.100 The binding constant
of the 11−⊂72+ complex was similar to that of the same guest
with β-cyclodextrin, a neutral noncharged receptor.
On the other hand, cyclophane 8 displayed a more
polarizable and deeper aromatic cavity than 7 owing to the
presence of ortho-methoxy substituents in the phenyl
rings99,101 (Figure 4). This structural modiﬁcation also
produced an increase of the cmc value to 10−2 M. Cyclophane
82+ complexed neutral, aromatic molecules, forming 1:1
inclusion complexes having stability constant values in the
order of Ka = 103−104 M−1.
The complexation process of aromatic guests with cyclo-
phanes was mainly driven by the HE, which made it diﬃcult to
dissect the contribution of π−π interactions to the binding. In
this regard, Diederich et al. applied cyclophanes 8, 9, and 10
(Figure 4) to examine the electronic complementarity between
receptors and guests.102 The main aim of these studies was to
derive the contribution of donor−acceptor interactions to
binding. 1,4-Disubstituted benzene derivatives were chosen as
guests because they displayed an axial binding geometry, i.e.,
the phenyl group was included in the cavity of the cyclophane
receptors and the polar groups in para-position were exposed
to the aqueous solution. The electronic properties of the π-
systems of the phenyl group in the guests can be tuned by the
electron-donor or electron-withdrawing characteristics of the
para-substituents. In turn, the change in the electrostatic
surface potential (ESP) of the guest’s π-systems was expected
to inﬂuence the thermodynamic stability of the inclusion
complexes. In this regard, the stabilities of the inclusion
complexes of cyclophane 92+ followed the expected trend with
respect to the electron donor−acceptor properties of the guest
substituents: acceptor−acceptor > donor−acceptor > donor−
donor. In contrast, cyclophanes 82+ and 102+ did not follow a
similar relationship. The diﬀerence in the obtained results was
attributed to the ortho-methoxy substituents in the phenyl rings
of cyclophanes 82+ and 102+. The authors indicated that

2).
Hunter et al. changed the ether linkages of the bis-
(diphenylmethane) cyclophanes to pyridyl 2,6-dicarboxamide
groups.103 The resulting receptor proved to be eﬀective for the
binding of cyclic dipeptides (Ka ca. 100 M−1). This receptor
constitutes one of the scarce examples of cyclophanes bearing
inwardly oriented polar binding functions (see section 5 for
three-dimensional receptors featuring polar hydrophobic
cavities).
The incorporation of two additional spiro-dimethyl-piper-
idinium units in the spacers of the bis-(diphenylmethane)
cyclophane scaﬀold aﬀorded compound 12100 (Figure 4).
Cyclophane 12 was characterized by a cmc value of 7.5 × 10−3
M, which is 50-fold larger than that of cyclophane 7 (1.6 ×
10−4 M). Furthermore, the ortho-methyl substituents of the
phenyl groups of 12 yielded a deeper and more hydrophobic
aromatic cavity enhancing the HE.69 Tetra-piperidinium 124+
was an eﬃcient receptor for the binding in water of neutral
polyaromatic guests, such as pyrene, perylene, and ﬂuoran-
thene, and anionic naphthalene derivatives, featuring dissoci-
ation constants in the micromolar range. For example, the
binding constant value of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate 2−
with receptor 124+ was almost 1 order of magnitude larger than
that with the simple tetra-cationic cyclohexyl-substituted
derivative of [1+4H]4+ (Table 3). Perylene 13 (Figure 5)
showed a perfect ﬁt for the aromatic cavity of 124+.100 The
13⊂124+ complex was highly stable in water featuring a
binding constant value of Ka = 1.6 × 107 M−1 (Figure 8).
The thermodynamic signatures experimentally measured by
Diederich et al. served to introduce the concept of the
“nonclassical” hydrophobic eﬀect (see section 2.1) for the
binding of aromatic guests with cyclophanes in water.4,101 The
binding processes were thermodynamically characterized by a
strong enthalpy gain, ΔH = −33.5 to −50.2 kJ·mol−1, and an
entropic penalty, TΔS = −8.4 to −20.9 kJ·mol−1. Note that
these thermodynamic signatures are in sharp contrast with the
ones expected for processes driven by the so-called “classical”
hydrophobic eﬀect (ΔH ∼0 and TΔS > 0). It was then
proposed that the large and negative enthalpic term derived
from the release of water molecules included in the receptor’s
cavity to the bulk solution. The included water molecules were
expected to have a higher enthalpy than those in the bulk
owing to the limited number of hydrogen bonds that they
could establish. Some of the enthalpy gained upon binding
could also derive from the more favorable enthalpic dispersion
interactions present in the complex compared to those in the
hydrated free binding partners. We commented above (section
2.1 dedicated to the HE) that the assignment of the
thermodynamic signatures of binding processes occurring in
water exclusively to energy diﬀerences between bound and
bulk-released water molecules is not recommended. Examples
of binding processes showing the characteristics of the
“nonclassical” HE and involving weakly hydrated nonpolar
binding sites are known.80
The thermodynamic stabilities (Ka) of the complexes
formed between cyclophane 82+ and para-substituted benzenes
were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy titrations in a
range of 20 K.104 The van’t Hoﬀanalyses of the titrations data
returned enthalpic terms that were qualitatively in good
agreement with those directly measured by calorimetry. The
observed changes in heat capacity (ΔCp) produced larger
uncertainty in the values calculated from the van’t Hoﬀ
analyses. The determined ΔCp values were in the order of ca.
−420 J·mol−1·K−1 for those guests having a strong dipole
moment and hydroxyl substituents. This magnitude of ΔCp
was in the same range of that determined for the binding of
nonpolar substrates with cyclodextrins.105
One of the issues with the diphenylmethane-based cyclo-
phane receptors is the easy rotation of their aromatic rings
leading to multiple conformations. In an eﬀort to reduce
conformational ﬂexibility, Wilcox et al. used molecular units
derived from Tröger’s base in the construction of cyclo-
phanes.106 The change of one of the diphenylmethane
components by a dibenzodiazocine scaﬀold aﬀorded a
relatively more rigid receptor, 14 (Figure 4). Cyclophane 14
is soluble at concentrations up to 5 × 10−2 M in 0.1 M KCl/
DCl buﬀer, pD = 1.9. In this acidic solution, three of the four
nitrogen atoms of 14 are protonated (one of the diazocine
nitrogen atoms remained unprotonated). The interaction of
[14+3H]3+ with a series of para-methyl-substituted benzenes
was probed by 1H NMR spectroscopy titrations. In all cases,
the signal corresponding to the para-methyl substituent of the
guests experienced the largest upﬁeld shift upon addition of the

The ﬁt of the chemical shift changes to a 1:1 binding model,
using a nonlinear least-squares method, returned binding
constant values in the range of 40−400 M−1. Neutral electron-
rich aromatic guests, such as 4-methylphenol, were weakly

increase in binding aﬃnity, Ka = 1.7 × 102 M−1. In the case of
anionic aromatic molecules, they were bound by [14+3H]3+
featuring Ka values in the order of 102−103 M−1. For example,
the binding constant of the 4-toluenesulfonate⊂[14+3H]3+
complex was 3.3 × 102 M−1. Probably, Coulombic interactions
were also at play. These latter association constant values were
in line with those reported by Diederich and co-workers using
cyclophanes 72+ and 82+ (Figure 4).
Dougherty et al. designed cyclophanes based on the
ethenoanthracene scaﬀold,107 15 and 16 (Figure 9). The
ethenoanthracene scaﬀold is rigid, concave, and delivers an
electron-rich aromatic surface area to the cyclophane’s cavity.
The phenyl and cyclohexyl spacers of 15 and 16, respectively,
also aid the cyclophanes to adopt a preorganized structure.
Carboxylate groups were anchored to the ethenoanthracene
units in the faces exposed to the bulk solution. In borate buﬀer
at pD = 9, cyclophanes 15 and 16 were soluble in water and
featured large cmc values in the range of 2−8 × 10−4 M.
The ethenoanthracene-based cyclophanes adopted two
possible conformations for binding: a rhomboid-shaped
conformation was preferred for planar guests, such as iminium
ions, whereas a toroid-shaped conformation was suitable for
the binding of spherical guests, such as tetra-alkylammonium
substrates. Neutral electron-deﬁcient aromatic molecules and
tetra-carboxylates of ethenoanthracene cyclophanes, 154−and
164−, formed 1:1 inclusion complexes featuring association
constant values in the range of Ka = 103−106 M−1. These
guests were preferentially bound to 154−and 164−than
electron-rich counterparts owing to the superior donor−
acceptor complementarity of the binding partners. Cyclo-
phanes 154−and 164−also showed high binding aﬃnity for
ammonium guests, such as N-methylquinolinium and N-
methylisoquinolinium. The binding studies assigned a gain of
12.5 kJ·mol−1 for the complexation free energy deriving from
the combination of donor−acceptor interactions and cation−π
interactions.107 The cation−π interaction accounted for at least
4.2 kJ·mol−1 or more to the thermodynamic stability of these
complexes.50 Long-range Coulombic interactions between the
external carboxylates of the receptors and the ammonium
group of the quinolinium unit of the guests contributed to a
lesser extent (<1.3 kJ·mol−1 per carboxylate group).107,108
Adamantane trimethylammonium 17+ (Figure 5) was a
perfect ﬁt for the cavity of the cyclophanes reported by
Dougherty and co-workers.107 The binding free energy of the
17+⊂154−complex was −28.0 kJ·mol−1. The 17+⊂154−
complex was 5.4 kJ·mol−1 thermodynamically more stable
than the 17+⊂164−(phenyl spacer substituted by cyclohexyl)
counterpart in borate buﬀer solution (pD = 9) (Table 3).
Interestingly, the complexation-induced chemical shifts
determined from the
1H NMR titration spectra indicated
that the trimethylammonium cation of guest 17+ was included
deeper in the hydrophobic aromatic cavity of the 154−receptor
than the adamantane unit (Figure 10).

The complexation of the ammonium organic guests by
cyclophane tetra-carboxylates 154−and 164−in water was
driven by enthalpy. The determined heat capacity values
(ΔCp) for these binding processes were large and negative109
(see section 2.1), and their magnitude coincided with those
determined by Diederich et al. for the binding of their
cyclophane receptors with polar para-substituted benzene
derivatives.
The existence and importance of the cation−π interaction in
synthetic and natural host−guest complexes was not obvious at
the time that Dougherty and co-workers introduced the
ethenoanthracene-based cyclophanes. In this regard, his group
conducted host−guest binding studies using a series of
cyclophane receptors, including tetra-carboxylates 154−and
164−and a library of cationic guests: alkyliminium, tetra-
alkylammonium, sulfonium, and guanidinium substrates.110
The results demonstrated that the cation−π interaction had a
signiﬁcant eﬀect in the stability of the host−guest complexes.
For example, the complexation of N-methylquinolinium was
10.5 kJ·mol−1 more favorable than that of the neutral closely
related derivative, 4-methylquinoline.
Dougherty et al. also investigated the inﬂuence on binding of
the negatively ionized carboxylate groups using modiﬁed
ethenoanthracene-based cyclophanes. For example, the phenyl
spacers of 154−were decorated with additional carboxylate
groups at their ortho-positions, providing extra electrostatic
interactions and, therefore, enhancing the binding aﬃnity
toward cationic organic guests.108 Conversely, the added
carboxylate groups impacted negatively on the recognition of
neutral molecules, presumably, owing to the reduction of the
hydrophobicity of the binding pocket. Interestingly, the
modiﬁed octa-carboxylate cyclophane receptor was highly
eﬀective for the binding of
L-arginine. The complex was
stabilized by Coulombic, π−π and cation−π interactions
between the guanidinium group of the guest and the highly
ionized (z = −8) aromatic scaﬀold of the receptor (Ka = 4.7 ×
103 M−1). The binding geometry and aﬃnity toward the
guanidinium cation of
L-arginine residues allowed the
recognition of dipeptides containing an L-arginine residue as
C-terminal amide. The second residue of the dipeptides
featured diﬀerent length side chains connecting to the terminal
ammonium group. The ammonium group could make a tight
salt-bridge with a carboxylate of the host. The authors
demonstrated that the precise position of the terminal
protonated amine was important and signiﬁcantly aﬀected
the binding energy. Other modiﬁcations at the spacers of
ethenoanthracene-based cyclophanes were reported in liter-
ature.110−113
Inspired by the cyclophane receptors reported by the group
of Dougherty, Otto, Sanders, and co-workers replaced the two
oxygen atoms at the aromatic rings of the ethenoanthracene
scaﬀold by thiol groups.114,115 The reaction of the dithiol
ethenoanthracene building block and a meta-dithiol phenyl
derivative led to a mixture of cyclophanes (dynamic
combinatorial library, DCL) by the formation of reversible
disulﬁde bonds (dynamic combinatorial chemistry, DCC).
Interestingly, the addition of cationic guests (e.g., quaternary
amines and imines) produced the ampliﬁcation of certain
cyclophanes of the DCL. Thus, the size and shape of the
templating guest determined the structure (type and number
of building blocks) of the major cyclophane present in the
DCL.
The results obtained in the binding of L-arginine with tetra-
carboxylate cyclophane 154−and other derivatives served for
the discovery by Waters et al., also using DCC studies, of an
eﬃcient and selective chiral receptor bearing two ethenoan-
thracene units and one naphthalene spacer linked by disulﬁde
bonds.116 This cyclophane was able to bind nonsymmetric
dimethyl
L-arginine (Me2N−CNH2−NH-alkyl), which is a
post-translational modiﬁcation in proteins, with signiﬁcant
selectivity over symmetric dimethyl
L-arginine (MeHN−
CNHMe−NH-alkyl, aka sRMe2, R = arginine in one letter
code) and the monomethylated counterpart (MeHN−CNH2−
NH-alkyl). The synthetic receptor displayed aﬃnities and
selectivity for the diﬀerent L-arginine methylation states that
are comparable to the native methyl L-arginine binding sites.
The dissociation constant of sRMe2 was in the low micromolar
range, which is remarkable owing to the fact that the main
driving force for binding was the interaction with the
methylated side chain. The observed higher selectivity for
sRMe2 over the monomethylated state was attributed to
diﬀerences in dispersion (van der Waals contacts), cation−π
interactions, and desolvation penalties. Waters et al. also
applied DCC studies to the identiﬁcation of ethenoanthracene-
based cyclophane receptors displaying high binding aﬃnity and
selectivity for ζ-trimethylammonium
L-lysine (KMe3
+, K =
lysine in one letter code) over di-, mono-, and nonmethylated
states of the L-lysine side-chain (KMen
+; n = 2−0).117,118
Lehn et al. used naphthalene units for the construction of
water-soluble cyclophanes. Receptor 18 featured two parallel
naphthalene units linked together by two polyamine linkers119
(Figure 9). At pH = 6 (pyridine/triﬂuoroacetic acid buﬀer),
four of the six amine nitrogen atoms of 18 were protonated
(Figure 11). The central nitrogen atoms remained unproto-
nated because, as a result of being ﬂanked by two ammonium
groups, their pKa values were relatively low. The existence of
four ammonium groups in [18+4H]4+ was expected to induce
a repulsion between them, thus circumventing the hydro-
phobic collapse of the cavity by stacking of its two aromatic
sections, “roof” and “ﬂoor”. 1H NMR and ﬂuorescence titration
experiments demonstrated that [18+4H]4+ was able to bind
aromatic carboxylates and nucleotides. Contrary to the binding
selectivity displayed by cyclophane 44+ (Figure 4) toward
adenine, receptor [18+4H]4+ selectively bound guanine 19
(Figure
5),
Ka

interactions and solvation processes (Figure 11 and Table

the complexation of the corresponding monophosphate
nucleotides, GMP2−and AMP2−. Most likely, this result was

a direct consequence of the relevance of the Coulombic
interactions in the binding of the nucleotides.86
Cyclophanes with larger aromatic cavities were constructed
using para-phenyl−ethynyl−phenyl units as building blocks.
For example, Schrader et al. reported the construction of
cyclophane 20 (Figure 9) based on the latter scaﬀold being
both the “roof” and “ﬂoor”.120 The ionized phosphonic acid
groups of the para-phenyl substituted spacers imparted water
solubility to 20, which featured a cmc value of 3 × 10−4 M.
The overall charge and its distribution were not ideal to avoid
aggregation at millimolar concentrations. Tetra-anionic
receptor 204−complexed protonated noradrenaline 21+
(Figure 5), among other catecholamines, forming 1:1 and
2:1 guest/host complexes. The stepwise binding constants
were in the order of 103 M−1.
On the other hand, structurally simple cyclophanes bearing
para-benzene derivatives at the “roof” and “ﬂoor” were
designed.121−123 As discussed above for cyclophane
[18+4H]4+, ammonium groups were incorporated to deliver
water solubility. The cationic nature of these simple cyclo-
phanes was applied in the binding of organic and inorganic
anions such as carboxylate and sulfate, respectively.
Paraquat units were also used as building blocks for the
synthesis of cyclophanes. The resulting cyclophanes featured
an electron-deﬁcient cavity, which was ideal for the complex-
ation of electron-rich aromatic molecules. The cationic
paraquat scaﬀolds also imparted water solubility. The cyclo-
bis-(paraquat-para-phenylene) cyclophane 22 was introduced
by Stoddart et al. in the late 1980s124 (Figure 9). The tetra-
cationic receptor 224+ featured a rectangular cavity with
dimensions of 10.3 × 6.8 Å2. In the presence of electron-rich
aromatic substrates, such as 1,4-dimethoxybenzene 23 (Figure
5), 1:1 inclusion complexes were formed in D2O solution. The
aromatic rings of host and guest established charge-transfer
π−π interactions. 1H NMR binding studies showed that the
aromatic protons of 23 experienced an upﬁeld shift of Δδ ∼
−3 ppm, whereas the protons of the methoxy groups moved
upﬁeld only Δδ ∼−0.5 ppm upon complexation. These
chemical shift changes indicated that the guest was bound in
an axial orientation. The para-methoxy substituents were
located at the portals of the receptor’s cavity (Figure 12). It is
interesting to note that the bis-paraquat cyclophane 224+ was
able to bind amino acids containing electron-rich aromatic
substituents, such as L-tryptophan.86
The axial binding geometry featured by certain aromatic
guests with receptor 224+ suggested that 1,4-dialkoxy-phenyl
and 1,5-dialkoxy-naphthalene derivatives would produce
inclusion complexes with pseudorotaxane topology.125,126
The binding constant values of the corresponding 1:1 inclusion
complexes were in the range between 104 and 106 M−1.
Note that the cyclophanes discussed above are monocyclic,
featuring shallow cavities open at both ends. The construction
of hydrophobic binding pockets shielded from solvation by
bulk water molecules requires preorganized, three-dimensional
structures (see section 2.1). This issue was addressed by
Diederich and co-workers using bicyclic cyclophanes. Cyclo-
phane 24 (Figure 13) bears ﬁve tertiary amines which, upon
partial protonation, delivered water solubility to the corre-
sponding multicationic receptor. The binding pocket of
multicationic 24 accommodated polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons.101 The aromatic guests resided in the plane deﬁned
by the three spiro-carbon atoms of the receptor. The
pyrene⊂24 inclusion complex was highly stable in water,127
Ka = 6.0 × 106 M−1 (Figure 13). The HE, dispersion, and
dipole-induced-dipole interactions (van der Waals forces)
played key roles in achieving the high levels of binding aﬃnity
for the inclusion complexes of 24.
3.2. Pillar[n]arenes
Pillar[n]arenes (n = 5−10) are synthesized by the acid-
catalyzed condensation of 1,4-dialkoxy-substituted benzenes
and paraformaldehyde. The para-benzene units are connected
at their 2- and 5-positions by methylene bridges in a cyclic
fashion (Figure 14a). Therefore, the aromatic panels of
pillar[n]arenes having suitable sized substituents can freely
rotate around the methylene bridges. This motion is fast on the
1H NMR chemical shift time scale. The cavity of pillar[n]-
arenes is electron-rich and hydrophobic, and it is open at two
opposite ends to the bulk solution.15,17 Pillar[n]arenes are able
to accommodate size and shape complementary electron-
deﬁcient guests.
Pillar[5]arenes were introduced by Ogoshi, Nakamoto, and
co-workers in 2008.128 The structure of pillar[5]arene
resembles a pentagon featuring a cavity diameter of ca. 5 Å
(Figure 14a), similar to that of α-cyclodextrin. Pillar[5]arenes
25a and 25b, bearing methoxy and hydroxyl substituents,
respectively, were soluble in most common organic solvents.
Nevertheless, the functionalization of the phenolic OHs with
ionizable or charged groups rendered water-soluble pillar[5]-
arenes.
Water-soluble pillar[5]arenes 26 and 27 were decorated
with carboxylate129−131 and ammonium132 residues, respec-
tively (Figure 14a). These pillar[5]arenes and bigger analogues
(pillar[n]arenes, n = 6−10)131,133 bound charged organic
guests in water, giving rise to 1:1 inclusion complexes in most
cases. The complexes were stabilized by a combination of the
HE, π−π, CH−π, charge-transfer, and Coulombic interactions
(see section 2).4,69 The charged groups at the portals of the
receptor’s cavity were the ones establishing Coulombic
interactions with the charged residues of bound guests. For

example, the deca-carboxylate pillar[5]arene receptor 2610−
and dimethyl viologen 282+ (Figure 14b) formed a 1:1
inclusion complex featuring a binding constant value Ka = 8.2
× 104 M−1 in water129 (Figure 15). Interestingly, the dicationic
guest 282+ threaded the cavity of pillar[5]arene 2610−, featuring
a pseudorotaxane-like topology. The inclusion complexes of
pillar[5]arenes and 1,4-bis-(pyridinium)butane guests dis-
played a similar binding geometry.130
Dasgupta, Mukherjee, and co-workers investigated the
association process of secondary dialkyl ammonium guests
29a,b (Figure 14b) with the deca-carboxylate pillar[5]arene
2610−in D2O solution without buﬀering the solution for pH
control.134 The analysis of the
1H NMR titration spectra
indicated that the binding process of the receptor, with any of
the two guests, experienced fast exchange dynamics on the
chemical shift time scale. This is a common feature of cyclic
receptors with cavities wide-open at its two ends and featuring
stability constants in the range of 103−105 M−1. One of the N-
alkyl substituents of protonated 29a+ or 29b+ was included in
the deca-carboxylate pillar[5]arene’s cavity, whereas the other
substituent was exposed to the bulk aqueous solution. The
ammonium group of the guest was involved in multiple
Coulombic interactions with the carboxylate residues at one of
the portals of the cavity. The determined association constant
values were 5.9 × 103 M−1 and 2.8 × 104 M−1 for the
29a+⊂2610−and 29b+⊂2610−complexes, respectively.
The larger diammonium guest 302+ (Figure 14b) and deca-
carboxylate pillar[5]arene 2610−formed a 1:2 guest/host
complex134 (Figure 16). The para-xylene spacer located
between the two ammonium cations of 302+ was optimal for
the formation of the ternary complex in water. The calculated
binding constant values for the ﬁrst and second binding events,
K1:1 (302+⊂2610−) = 6.2 × 102 M−1 and K1:2 (302+⊂2610−⇌
302+⊂[262]20−) = 1.7 × 102 M−1, indicated that the binding
process did not show signs of cooperativity (α = [4 × K1:2]/
K1:1 ∼1). The lack of binding cooperativity shows that water
molecules solvating charged groups may exert large screening
eﬀects in their Coulombic interactions. In short, the two copies
of receptor 2610−involved in the 1:2 complex did not display
signiﬁcant repulsive intermolecular Coulombic interactions
between the terminal carboxylate groups.
Li, Jia, and co-workers showed that the deca-carboxylate
pillar[5]arene 2610−also bound cationic L-arginine, L-lysine,
and
L-histidine, forming 1:1 inclusion complexes with
moderate-binding aﬃnities (Ka ∼103 M−1).135 The binding
selectivity toward these amino acids was remarkable in
comparison with other α-amino acids (Ka ca. 20 M−1). The
guanidinium, ammonium, and imidazolium cationic groups of
the former amino acids established additional Coulombic
interactions with the carboxylate residues at the receptor’s
portal opposite to the one involved in the complexation of the
α-ammonium group (see also ethenoanthracene-based cyclo-
phane complexes in section 3.1). This ditopic binding mode
was used to explain the observed binding selectivity in favor of
the dicationic amino acids.136
As discussed above, deca-carboxylate pillar[5]arene 2610−
was a good receptor for positively charged guests, but it did not
bind negatively charged counterparts. On the contrary, the
deca-trimethylammonium pillar[5]arene 2710+ (Figure 14a)
recognized negatively charged guests, such as carboxylic acids
and sulfonates. Huang et al. reported binding studies of 1-
octylsulfonate sodium salt 31 (Figure 14b) with receptor
27.132 The 31−⊂2710+ complex formed in solution featured an
inclusion binding geometry in which the octyl chain of the
bound guest was included in the receptor’s cavity (Figure 17).
The sulfonate group of 31−was then involved in electrostatic

co-workers reported similar examples on the binding proper-
ties of 2710+ (used as tetraﬂuoroborate salt instead of bromide)
using aromatic sulfonates as guests.137,138
A deca-amine pillar[5]arene acted as a wheel or cyclic
component in the formation of 1:1 complexes with long-chain
α,ω-diacids in water, as shown by Yu, Hou, and co-workers.139
The aliphatic chain of the bis-carboxylates threaded the
aromatic cavity of the pillar[5]arene. The complex formation
was driven by the HE and the establishment of multiple CH−π
interactions. In addition, the ionized carboxylic acids
(carboxylates) of the guests and the cationic primary
ammonium groups at the portals of the host were involved
in Coulombic interactions. In general, the binding constants of
the dicarboxylate⊂[pillar[5]arene+nH]n+ complexes were in
the order of 104 M−1.
Huang et al. also investigated the binding properties of the
deca-trimethylammonium receptor 2710+ using a series of
neutral guests (alkanes, aliphatic alcohols, xylenes, etc.) in
water.140 The complexation of neutral substrates by the
pillar[5]arenes is driven by the HE, π−π, CH−π, and
dispersion (i.e., van der Waals) interactions. The binding
constant values of the latter complexes were in the order of
10−102 M−1. Most likely, the reduction in binding constant
values resulted from the lack of Coulombic interactions
between host and guest. As expected for the HE being the
main component driving the binding process, the association
constant values for aliphatic alcohols increased with the length
of the alkyl chain: n-pentanol > n-butanol > n-propanol.
Pillar[6]arene possesses an hexagonal cavity with a diameter
of ca. 6.7 Å. The cavity size is slightly larger than that of β-
cyclodextrin. Water-soluble pillar[6]arenes 32−35 were
functionalized with carboxylate, pyridinium, trimethylammo-
nium, and 1-methyl-1H-imidazolium groups,17 respectively
(Figure 18a). Huang et al. reported pillar[6]arene 32 featuring
a cmc value of ca. 10−4 M.141 The binding studies of receptor
32 were performed in dilute water solutions and monitored
using UV/vis and ﬂuorescence spectroscopies. Dodeca-
carboxylate pillar[6]arene 3212−bound pyridinium cations, in
agreement with the previous results discussed for the deca-
carboxylate pillar[5]arene 2610−having a reduced cavity size.
The binding constant value of the 36+⊂3212−inclusion
complex between 1-octylpyridinium 36+ (Figure 18c) and
pillar[6]arene 3212−was determined to be 3.3 × 105 M−1 in
aqueous solution (Table 4). The high binding constant value
displayed by the latter complex is derived from the Coulombic
interactions established between the pyridinium cation of the
guest and the carboxylate residues at one of the host’s portals
as well as the establishment of multiple host−guest CH−π and
π−π interactions (see section 2). Pillar[6]arene 3212−also
formed thermodynamically highly stable 1:1 inclusion
complexes with α,ω-long-chain aliphatic guests bearing a
pyridinium cation at one end and a pyrene unit at the opposite
one (Ka ∼105 M−1). The bound guests were threaded through
the cavity of 3212−. As described above, the terminal
pyridinium cation established Coulombic interactions with
the carboxylate residues of one of the host’s portals, whereas
the terminal pyrene unit remained exposed to the bulk solution
through the opposite host’s portal.
The cationic trans-azobenzene 37+ (Figure 18b) was nicely
included in the aromatic cavity of pillar[6]arene 3212−(Figure
19). In contrast, pillar[6]arene 3212−was not able to
accommodate the cis-conformation of the diphenyl-azo group
of 37+.142 Alternatively, cis-37+ formed an inclusion complex
with 3212−by including its trimethylammonium group in the
receptor’s cavity (Figure 19). The cis-37+⊂3212−complex was
stabilized mainly by establishing cation−π and CH−π
interactions between the ammonium group of the guest and
the electron-rich aromatic panels of the receptor. The diﬀerent
binding modes of the two complexes, trans-37+⊂3212−and cis-
37+⊂3212−, translated in 1 order of magnitude diﬀerence
between their corresponding stability constant values, favoring
the complexation of trans-37+ (Table 4).

Jia, Li and co-workers reported pillar[6]arene 33 decorated
with 12 pyridinium cations (Figure 18a), which imparted
receptor’s water solubility.143 The authors investigated the
binding of dodeca-pyridinium 3312+ with naphthalenesulfo-
nates, 38−and 392−(Figure 18c), in phosphate buﬀer at pH =
7.2. The upﬁeld complexation-induced shifts (Δδ) experienced
by the aromatic protons of the bound guests were in the range
of −0.3 to −0.5 ppm. This indicated that the naphthalene
group of the guests was included in the aromatic cavity of the
receptor. The binding constant values of the 38−⊂3312+ and
392−⊂3312+ inclusion complexes were calculated as 3.8 × 104
and 2.1 × 105 M−1, respectively, by means of ﬂuorescence
titration experiments. The binding constant of 392−⊂3312+ was
almost 1 order of magnitude larger than that of 38−⊂3312+.
This result was explained considering the additional
Coulombic interactions (ditopic interaction) established
between the extra sulfonate group present in 392−and the
cationic pyridinium groups at the receptor’s portals (Figure
20). As could be expected, the analogous dodeca-trimethy-
lammonium pillar[6]arene 3412+ (Figure 18a) reported by Xue
et al. complexed the naphthalenesulfonate 38−featuring a
binding constant value similar to that of the 38−⊂3312+
complex.144
Xue et al. also reported binding studies between the sodium
salt of 4-hydroxybenzoate 40 (Figure 18c) and dodeca-
bromide dodeca-imidazolium pillar[6]arene 35 (Figure 18a)
using ﬂuorescence spectroscopy.145 The binding constant value
of the 40−⊂3512+ complex was determined to be 3.2 × 106
M−1 (Table 4). The authors suggested that, in the 40−⊂3512+
inclusion complex, ionic hydrogen-bonding interactions (see
salt-bridges in section 2) were established between the
carboxylate group of the bound guest and the hydrogen
atom of the imidazolium cations, NCHN+, at one of the two
portals of the receptor’s cavity.
Recently, Isaacs et al. reported the synthesis and binding
properties of a family of sulfated pillar[n]arenes (n = 5−7).146
The design of these pillar[n]arenes consisted on the
elimination of the methylene groups between the oxygen
atoms of the para-benzene rings and the carboxylate groups, as
well as the replacement of the latter to give sulfate groups. The
sulfate groups provided a highly charge density around the
portals of the receptors. The sulfated pillar[n]arenes (n = 5−6)

demonstrated to be more eﬃcient, in most of the cases, toward
the binding of quaternary ammonium guests than the
carboxylate pillar[n]arenes 2610−and 3212−discussed above.
Pillar[6]arenes have potential applications in many ﬁelds.136
For example, Xia, Shi, and co-workers applied the dodeca-
carboxylate pillar[6]arene 3212−(Figure 18a) for the
protection of azastilbene 412+ in water solution147 (Scheme
1). Azastilbene 412+ underwent hydration upon photo-
irradiation at 365 nm in water, producing adduct 422+.
Nevertheless, in the presence of receptor 3212−, the
concentration of azastilbene 412+ free in water solution was
signiﬁcantly reduced, Ka (412+⊂3212−) = 1.9 × 107 M−1. This
provoked a dramatic decrease of the photohydration reaction
rate. Thus, the pillar[6]arene 3212−functioned as a supra-
molecular protecting group for the photolabile guest 412+,
presumably absorbing the high-energy photons from the light
source or increasing the energy of the hydration-reaction
transition state of the included guest.
3.3. Cucurbit[n]urils
The condensation reaction of glycoluril and its derivatives with
formaldehyde in acidic media produces cyclic and acyclic
cucurbit[n]urils.148−150 The cyclic cucurbit[n]urils (n = 5−8,
43−46) feature a pumpkin-like structure, in which the
glycoluril units are linked together by 2 × n methylene bridges
(Figure 21). In contrast to the pillar[n]arenes (section 3.2),
the glycoluril units cannot freely rotate around the methylene
junctions of the cucurbit[n]urils, leading to conformationally
rigid receptors’ structures. All cyclic cucurbit[n]urils display a
cavity depth of ca. 9.1 Å, but they have diﬀerent cavity
diameters. The cavity volume of the cyclic cucurbit[n]urils
varies from 82 (43, n = 5, CB5) to 479 Å3 (46, n = 8, CB8)
(Figure 21).
There are also many examples of acyclic glycoluril-based
receptors reported by Isaacs, Wang, and co-workers. However,
these tweezer-like receptors are outside of the scope of this
review and the interested reader is referred to other literature
references.15,151−156
The cyclic cucurbit[n]urils feature a hydrophobic cavity with
two polar and open ends. The two portals of the cavity are
deﬁned by the carbonyl groups of the glycoluril compo-
nents.148 The carbonyl groups of these receptors are keen to be
involved in dipole-mediated interactions with complementary
functional groups of the bound guests.69,150 The interior of the
cucurbit[n]uril receptors is suitable for the inclusion of
nonpolar residues. The internal surface of the cucurbit[n]urils’
cavity displays a reduced polarizability. In this sense, the
molecules included in the cavity experience an environment
that is comparable to the gas phase.2 Owing to their symmetry,
cucurbit[n]urils possess a large quadrupole moment, which
may be relevant for the arrangement of included dipolar and
quadrupolar molecules as well as for the packing that they
adopt in the solid state.157
The solubility of the cucurbit[n]uril derivatives 43−46 in
pure water is diﬀerent.149 Cucurbit[6]uril 44 and cucurbit[8]-
uril 46 are poorly soluble (<10−4 M), whereas cucurbit[5]uril
43 and cucurbit[7]uril 45 possess good solubility in water (2−
3 × 10−3 M) (Figure 21). Studies in the solid state showed that
cucurbit[6]uril 44 and cucurbit[8]uril 46 self-associated more
eﬃciently than cucurbit[5]uril 43 or cucurbit[7]uril 45 by
intermolecular CH···O interactions (methylene and methine
hydrogen atoms and carbonyl oxygen atoms).158 This may
explain the more favorable solvation of CB5 43 and CB7 45
compared to that of CB6 44 and CB8 46. It is worth
mentioning that the referred cucurbit[n]uril derivatives are
neutral receptors and their water solubility is mainly imparted
by the polar ureido groups at the portals. The protonation or
coordination with alkali ions of their carbonyl oxygen atoms
increases the solubility of cucurbit[n]urils in water.136,148

In general, the inclusion complexes of cucurbit[n]urils 43−
46 with nonpolar or positively charged guests are kinetically
stable (i.e., chemical exchange between free and bound
components is slow on the
1H NMR chemical shift time
scale). Most likely, their kinetic stability is derived from the
small diameter of the portals (ca. 2 Å less) with respect to that
of the internal cavity.136,148 The in/out exchange processes of
the guests display high-energy barriers even for complexes not
thermodynamically highly stable.
The complexes of cucurbit[n]urils with cationic guests are
characterized by association constant values that are 3 orders
of magnitude larger than those with structurally related neutral
guests.69 This increase in thermodynamic stability results from
the additional stabilization of the charged complexes by means
of cation−dipole interactions.159 The complexation process of
size and shape complementary guests with cucurbit[n]urils
(CBs) is driven by the “nonclassical” hydrophobic eﬀect (i.e.,
enthalpically driven binding process) and the diﬀerence in
dispersion interactions of the complex (polarizable bound
guest in the nonpolarizable interior of the cyclic host) with
those present in the hydrated partners free in solution.69 The
origin of the binding enthalpy using cucurbit[n]uril receptors
was attributed to the release of “high-energy” water molecules
from the receptor’s cavity to the bulk solution upon
complexation.68,69 The “nonclassical” hydrophobic eﬀect is
maximized in the case of cucurbit[7]uril 45, for which the
number of bound water molecules in the cavity that cannot
satisfy their hydrogen-bonding characteristics is supposed to be
modest.68,69 Despite the fact that the cavity featured by
cucurbit[n]urils is open at its two ends, their inclusion
complexes seem to obey the 55% packing coeﬃcient rule
introduced by Rebek and co-workers.160
In general, cucurbit[5]uril 43 binds small molecules and
noble gases, whereas cucurbit[6]uril 44 is able to accom-
modate aliphatic residues. The larger cavities provided by
cucurbit[7]uril 45 and cucurbit[8]uril 46 can accommodate
even aromatic guests.150
In particular, cucurbit[5]uril 43 displays a small cavity
volume (83 Å3) limiting the number of complementary guests.
For example, 43 bound neutral small molecules, such as
methanol and acetonitrile, diatomic gases (e.g., N2, O2, CO and
CO2) and noble gas atoms (e.g., Ar).149,150 Owing to the polar
character of the cavity portals, 43 also formed endo-complexes
with either inorganic or organic cations, such as Pb2+ or
ammonium salts, respectively. The bound cationic guests
served to seal the hydrophobic cavity of cucurbit[5]uril 43.
Recently, Biedermann, Vankova, Heine, Duignan, Nau, and co-
workers demonstrated that the binding process of noble gases
to cucurbit[5]uril 43 was driven by diﬀerences in cavitation
energies,81 i.e., the recovery of the formed void cavities in the
bulk aqueous solution by inclusion of the solvated guest in the
receptor’s binding site (see section 2.1).
Cucurbit[6]uril 44 features a cavity diameter of 5.8 Å148
(Figure 21). In the solid state, three water molecules are
included in the cavity of 44.149 Most likely, the cavity of the
receptor is also solvated in water solution. The bound water
molecules are released to the bulk solution upon guest binding.
Aliphatic mono- and diammonium cations were bound by 44,
producing 1:1 inclusion complexes.148−150 For example, Mock
and Shih showed that the alkyl chain of protonated n-butyl
amine, [47+H]+ (Figure 22), was a perfect ﬁt for the cavity
volume of 44 and, therefore, it formed the most stable complex
of the n-alkyl ammonium series, Ka ([47+H]+⊂44) = 1.0 × 105
M−1.161,162 For alkyl diammonium salts, hexane-1,6-diammo-
nium [48+2H]2+ (Figure 22) was also a good ﬁt for receptor
44.161 Thus, [48+2H]2+ threaded through the cavity of the
cucurbit[6]uril. This binding geometry placed the two
ammonium groups of the guest near the two opposite polar
portals of the receptor rendering a 1:1 host/guest ditopic
binding with a stability constant of Ka ([48+2H]2+⊂44) = 2.8
× 106 M−1 (Figure 23). The 1:1 inclusion complexes were
stabilized by the combination of the HE, ion−dipole, and
hydrogen-bonding (dipole−dipole) interactions (see section
Figure 22. Line-drawing structures of a series of compounds studied as guest molecules for the binding with cucurbit[n]urils (n = 6−8) receptors.

2). It is worth mentioning that, owing to the low solubility of
44 in pure water, the above-described inclusion complexes
were formed in a 1:1 formic acid/water solution mixture.
Remarkably, Inoue, Kim, and co-workers showed that the
binding constant value of the [47+H]+⊂44 complex
determined in a 5 × 10−2 M aqueous NaOAc buﬀer at pH
∼4.7 displayed an analogous magnitude163 (Table 5).
Cucurbit[6]uril 44 also complexed neutral molecules with
good binding aﬃnities. For example, Kim et al. and Bartik et al.
independently reported the complexation of tetrahydrofuran
by 44 featuring a binding constant value of Ka = 1.7 × 103 M−1
in water.164,165
Recently, Nau et al. reported the binding of di-iodine 49
(Figure 22) with cucurbit[6]uril 44.166 The corresponding 1:1
inclusion complex, 49⊂44, featured a large association
constant value, Ka = 1.4 × 106 M−1. The complex was
stabilized mainly by the HE. Interestingly, halogen-bonding
interactions (see section 2) between the iodine atoms of
bound 49 and the π-system of the carbonyl groups of 44 were
also claimed to be important and responsible of the tilted
orientation observed for the bound guest (Figure 24).
As mentioned above for cucurbit[5]uril 43, inorganic cations
were also bound to the polar CO groups at the cavity portals
of 44.149 The binding constant value of the latter complexes
were determined to be in the order of 102−103 M−1. This
result suggested that inorganic cations could interfere in the
formation of the inclusion complexes.
Cucurbit[6]uril 44 was applied in the self-assembly of
(pseudo)rotaxanes167 and in the assistance of chemical
transformations, yielding rotaxanes.168 For example, 44
catalyzed the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of alkynes and azides,
aka “click” reaction, in water169 (Scheme 2). Both terminal

alkyne and azide guests, bearing ammonium groups at the
distal ends of their short alkyl chains, formed inclusion
complexes with 44. The use of 44 in catalytic amounts induced
an acceleration in the formation of the corresponding triazole
and rendered the reaction regioselective (1,4-isomer exclu-
sively formed). Mock et al. rationalized the obtained results by
the transient formation of a 2:1 ternary heterocomplex.169 In
this complex, the reacting groups of the two guests were
included in the hydrophobic cavity of the receptor, leading to
an increase in local concentration and a putative compression
of reactants.170 The latter eﬀect might destabilize the ground-
state energy with respect to that of the transition state, thus
reducing the reaction’s energy barrier.171 Unfortunately, the
use of cucurbit[6]uril 44, as catalyst suﬀered of product
inhibition. This issue is very common in the use of
supramolecular containers for the acceleration of chemical
reactions.
One of the main limitations of the use of cucurbit[6]uril 44
is its low solubility in water. To overcome it, Inoue, Kim, and
co-workers designed the cyclohexyl-substituted cucurbit[6]uril
50, whose solubility is 0.2 M in water163 (Figure 21a). The
cavity size of 50 was analogous to that of 44. However, the
binding constant values of the inclusion complexes of 50 in
pure water were 2−5 orders of magnitude larger than those
reported for 44, either in a 1:1 formic acid/water mixture or
salt solution. For example, the complexes between aliphatic
monoammonium guests and 50 featured binding constant
values in the range of Ka = 104−108 M−1. In the same vein, the
binding constants of α,ω-aliphatic diammonium salts increased
up to 107−1010 M−1. For example, the tetra-protonated
spermine 514+ (Figure 22) formed a thermodynamically highly
stable complex with 50 featuring a binding constant value of
3.4 × 1012 M−1 in pure water (Figure 25).
Cucurbit[7]uril 45, featuring a cavity volume of 279 Å3
(Figure 21), constitutes a paradigmatic example of the
“nonclassical” HE for binding owing to the large magnitudes
of the enthalpic term measured for its complexation.2,149,172
The association constant values of the 1:1 inclusion complexes
derived from 45 were in the range of 107−1017 M−1.
Cucurbit[7]uril 45 complexed neutral and charged guests,
such as aromatic, adamantane, and ferrocene derivatives.
Inoue, Kaifer, Kim, and co-workers showed that neutral
ferrocene 52 (Figure 22) was bound by cucurbit[7]uril 45 with
high aﬃnity, Ka = 3.0 × 109 M−1 in water at neutral pH.173 The
ferrocene guest 52 nicely ﬁlled the cavity volume of the
receptor. Additionally, the binding constants of complexes of
45 with ferrocene derivatives decorated with ammonium
groups were boosted up to values of 1012−1015 M−1.2,136 These
results evidenced the signiﬁcant role played by the cation−
dipole interactions in the formation of supramolecular
complexes derived from cucurbit[n]uril receptors.
Gamal-Eldin and Macartney investigated the complexation
of the protonated tertiary amines N-methyl piperidine
[53+H]+, N-methyl pyrrolidine [54+H]+, and N-methyl
morpholine [55+H]+ (Figure 22), to cucurbit[7]uril 45 in 5
× 10−2 M NaOAc buﬀer at pH ∼4.7.174 The binding constant
values of these 1:1 complexes were in the order of 106−107
M−1 (Table 5). Interestingly, the analysis of the 1H NMR
spectra of equimolar mixtures of host and guest supported the
inclusion of the bound ammonium cation in the hydrophobic
cavity of receptor 45.
Cucurbit[7]uril 45 also included protonated amino-
adamantane derivatives featuring Ka = 1012−1014 M−1 in
water.175 The adamantane group was a perfect ﬁt for the cavity
of receptor 45. In these cases, the adamantane group was
buried in the receptor’s cavity while the ammonium group
remained exposed to the bulk solution15 (see ethenoanthra-
cene-based cyclophanes in section 3.1 for a diﬀerent binding
geometry). The latter was involved in cation−dipole
interactions with the carbonyl groups at one of the two polar
portals of the receptor.4 Isaacs et al. reported the accurate
binding constant values of the complexes of adamantane
trimethylammonium 17+ (Figure 5) and protonated amino-
adamantane [56+H]+ (Figure 22) with 45 as 1.7 × 1012 M−1
and 4.2 × 1012 M−1, respectively, in aqueous buﬀer solution at
pH ∼4.7.175

binding equilibria of cucurbit[7]uril 45 was key in the design

compete with guest binding to the dipoles of the carbonyl
groups at the portals of cucurbit[n]urils. The crystal structure
of the 572+⊂45 complex showed that the two ammonium
cations of 572+ established a total of 14 cation−dipole
interactions with the carbonyl groups of the receptor (Figure
26). Furthermore, dicationic diamantane derivative 572+ and
cucurbit[7]uril 45 were size and shape complementary,
maximizing nonpolar contacts. The inclusion of the nonpolar
section of 572+ into the hydrophobic cavity of 45 was an
enthalpically driven process. On the contrary, the interaction of
ammonium cations with the carbonyl groups of the receptor
was mainly favored by entropy.2,136

groups, for the complexation processes of cucurbit[7]uril 45,
suggested that the increase in the number of cationic groups
attached to the guest’s scaﬀold did not impact on the enthalpic
contribution to complex formation (ca. −88 kJ·mol−1). In
contrast, the overall charge (z = +1, e.g., monoammonium
ferrocene) of the guest had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
entropic component by favoring the binding process (change
of ca. 17 kJ·mol−1).2 Thus, some inclusion complexes with
cucurbit[7]uril 45 seemed to overcome the typically observed
enthalpy−entropy compensation eﬀect, as shown by Kaifer,
Isaacs, Gilson, Kim, Inoue, and co-workers.172
Furthermore, Natarajan, Kim, and co-workers demonstrated
that receptor 45 was able to bind protonated amino-
saccharides, such as D-galactosamine hydrochloride 58 (Figure
22), with good binding aﬃnity (Table 5).177 It is worth
mentioning here that the α/β-mutarotation of saccharides is
slow on the 1H NMR chemical shift time scale and the α/β
ratio at equilibrium in water solution is ca. 63:37 for
protonated 58+. The results of 2D NMR experiments
demonstrated that the α-anomer of the monosaccharide 58+
was preferentially bound by 45. Most likely, the α-anomer was
involved in energetically more favorable cation−dipole
interactions4 when bound in the cavity of cucurbit[7]uril
(Figure 27a).
Owing to the excellent binding performance of cucurbit[7]-
uril 45 toward ammonium guests, the binding properties of the
receptor were also investigated in the recognition of aromatic
amino acids in acidic aqueous solution. In this respect, the
aromatic residue of the amino acid was included in the
hydrophobic cavity of 45, and the ammonium group interacted
electrostatically with the carbonyl groups of one of the
receptor’s polar portals. The binding constant of the amino
acid complexes were high. For example, L-phenylalanine 59
(Figure 22) and cucurbit[7]uril 45 formed a 1:1 complex,
[59+H]+⊂45, featuring a stability constant of Ka = 1.2 × 106
M−1 in phosphoric acid buﬀer at pH = 2178 (Figure 27b).
More interestingly, cucurbit[7]uril 45 displayed a modest
binding selectivity for L-phenylalanine over other aromatic
amino acids.
Cucurbit[7]uril 45 was also applied in supramolecular
catalysis. Masson, Scherman, and co-workers investigated the
eﬀect of 45 in the intramolecular Diels−Alder reaction of N-
allyl-2-furfurylamines,179 such as 60 (Figure 22 and Figure
28a). In the absence of the receptor, 60 reacted to produce the
corresponding Diels−Alder product in less than 10% yield after
25 days. In contrast, the yield of the reaction increased up to
90% in only 6 h when cucurbit[7]uril 45 was added to the
solution in catalytic amounts. The cucurbit[7]uril 45
complexed the protonated reactant, [60+H]+, in a hairpin-
like conformation. In this conformation, the diene and the

dienophile groups were in close proximity (Figure 28b). The
stabilization of the bound reactant in this high-energy
conformation decreased the energy barrier of the intra-
molecular Diels−Alder reaction.
Cucurbit[n]urils 43−45 (CB5, CB6, CB7) do not form
inclusion complexes of stoichiometry larger than 1:1 due to the
limited dimensions of their cavities, with a few exceptions. On
the other hand, cucurbit[8]uril 46 with a cavity diameter of 8.8
Å (Figure 21) enables the formation of homoternary, 2:1, and
heteroternary, 1:1:1, inclusion complexes.15
Cucurbit[8]uril 46 and the electron-deﬁcient dimethyl
viologen 282+ (Figure 14b) formed a 1:1 inclusion complex
stabilized by the HE and cation−dipole interactions, as shown
by Kim and co-workers.180 Kim et al.181 and Urbach et al.182
independently reported that the binding constant value of the
282+⊂46 complex was in the order of 105 M−1 in phosphate
buﬀer at pH = 7 (Ka = 1.1 × 105 M−1 in 0.5 M phosphate
buﬀer by UV−vis spectroscopy titrations and Ka = 8.5 × 105
M−1 in 10−2 M phosphate buﬀer by ITC experiments).
Dimethyl viologen 282+ ﬁlled approximately half of the cavity
of 46 and, therefore, the remaining free space was similar to
the cavity size of cucurbit[7]uril 45. Most likely, repulsive
Coulombic interactions disfavored the binding of a second
viologen molecule in the cavity of the 282+⊂46 complex.
Conversely, the addition of the neutral, electron-rich 2,6-
dihydroxynaphthalene 61 (Figure 22) to the 282+⊂46 complex
provoked the quantitative formation of the heteroternary [61·
282+]⊂46 complex180 (Figure 29). The coinclusion of 282+
and 61 in the cavity of cucurbit[8]uril 46 was mainly driven by
the HE. Biedermann, Scherman, and co-workers demonstrated
that the binding strength in the 1:1:1 heteroternary complex
depended on the solvation/desolvation energies of the free
guests, 282+ and 61.183−185 On the other hand, the binding
selectivity was controlled by the establishment of π−π and
charge-transfer interactions between the two electronic
complementary aromatic surfaces of the included guests. The
charge-transfer excited-state was also stabilized by the
coinclusion of 282+ and 61 within the cucurbit[8]uril 46.184
Urbach et al. applied the preassembled 282+⊂46 inclusion
complex for the recognition of L-tryptophan residues (Trp).182
The formation of the corresponding 1:1:1 heteroternary
complex, [62·282+]⊂46, induced the observation of the
expected charge-transfer band between the bound viologen
282+ and the indole group of L-tryptophan 62 (Figure 22). The
complex formation also provoked the quenching of the
ﬂuorescence emission of the indole group. The stepwise
binding constant for the inclusion of L-tryptophan 62 into the
cavity of 282+⊂46 was calculated as Ka (282+⊂46 ⇌[62·
282+]⊂46) = 4.3 × 104 M−1 in 10−2 M sodium phosphate
buﬀer at pH = 7. The binding process was enthalpically driven,
ΔH = −44.3 kJ·mol−1, and opposed by entropy, TΔS = −17.6
kJ·mol−1. At r.t., the thermodynamic parameters were
consistent with the so-called “nonclassical” hydrophobic eﬀect
operating in the formation of this and other structurally related
inclusion complexes (see HE in section 2.1). The preas-
sembled 282+⊂46 complex also recognized with high aﬃnity
and selectively the L-tryptophan residue at the N-terminal
position of L-tryptophan-containing tripeptides over those
incorporated at the internal position or the C-terminus.182
Interestingly, in the absence of dimethyl viologen 282+, the
tripeptide Trp-Gly-Gly (Gly = glycine) dimerized in the cavity
of cucurbit[8]uril 46 by the inclusion of two N-terminal L-
tryptophan residues.182,186 The binding process of Trp-Gly-Gly
with 46 displayed noncooperativity (α = 4 × K2:1/K1:1 = 1),
whereas it showed positive cooperativity (α > 1) for the
dimerization of Phe-Gly-Gly (Phe = phenylalanine) within 46.
More recently, Urbach et al. reported that the tripeptide Tyr-
Leu-Ala (Tyr = tyrosine; Leu = leucine, and Ala = alanine)
bound to cucurbit[8]uril 46 featuring a binding constant value
of Ka = 1.4 × 108 M−1 in 10−2 M sodium phosphate buﬀer at
pH = 7. The latter complex also displayed high sequence
speciﬁcity (e.g., the sequence isomer Tyr-Ala-Leu featured a
much lower association constant, Ka = 2.9 × 104 M−1).187 The
Tyr and Leu residues of the tripeptide Tyr-Leu-Ala were
included in the hydrophobic cavity of cucurbit[8]uril 46,
whereas the C-terminal alanine residue was placed near the
CB8’s portals.
Urbach, Bielawski, Scherman, and co-workers replaced the
viologen paraquat 282+ in the 282+⊂46 complex by the tetra-
methyl benzo-bis-imidazolium 632+188 (Figure 22). The benzo-
bis-imidazolium 632+ and cucurbit[8]uril 46 also formed a 1:1
inclusion complex (Ka = 5.7 × 105 M−1 in 10−2 M sodium
phosphate buﬀer at pH = 7). In this case, the formation of the
heteroternary inclusion complex with 61 induced the
quenching of the ﬂuorescence emission of bound 632+. The
association constant of 632+⊂46 with 61 to give the [61·
632+]⊂46 complex was determined to be Ka (632+⊂46 ⇌[61·
632+]⊂46) = 7.2 × 104 M−1.
Interestingly, the 1:1 inclusion complex formed between bis-
imidazolium 642+ (Figure 22) and cucurbit[8]uril 46, reported
by Scherman et al., featured a cage-like structure189 (Figure
30). The two terminal imidazolium cations of 642+ sealed the
openings of the two opposite portals of the bound receptor 46.
A binding constant value of Ka (642+⊂46) = 1.9 × 106 M−1 was

determined for the 1:1 complex in water using ITC
experiments. The 642+⊂46 complex was able to accommodate
small guest molecules (G) in the free available space of the
cavity, leading to 1:1:1 heteroternary complexes. The stepwise
stability constant value for the second binding event of the [G·
642+]⊂46 complex was in the order of 103 M−1. Note that the
structure of the cage-like complex 642+⊂46 imposes a severe
size selective binding in the coinclusion of a second guest
(Figure 30). This requirement precluded the coinclusion of the
large 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene guest 61 in the preformed
642+⊂46 complex.
Further investigations by Biedermann et al. suggested that
the binding of an auxiliary guest into the cavity of
cucurbit[8]uril 46 produced “high-energy” water molecules
to be present in the interior of the preformed 1:1 complex.185
The included “high-energy” water molecules are supposed to
be ejected to the bulk solution upon formation of the ternary
complex. This binding scenario was used by the authors to
explain the favorable enthalpy (ΔH < 0) and unfavorable
entropy (TΔS < 0) characterizing the inclusion processes of
the second guest.
Cucurbit[8]uril 46 was applied as nanoreactor in asym-
metric catalysis by Scherman, Herrmann, and co-workers.190
Thus, the Diels−Alder reaction of azachalcone and cyclo-
pentadiene using a simple amino acid as chiral source (L-
tryptophan 62), Cu(II) as Lewis acid, and cucurbit[8]uril 46
produced high enantioselectivities (up to 92% ee) (Scheme 3).
Likewise, the reactions experienced modest rate accelerations
(9.5-fold) when compared to the outcomes using larger
bioinspired catalysts (DNA and protein scaﬀolds). During
catalysis, the aromatic side chain of the amino acid, i.e., L-
tryptophan 62, and the pyridine ring of the dienophile were
included in the cavity of cucurbit[8]uril 46 forming a ternary
complex. Most likely, both included residues were also
complexed to Cu(II) and the vinylbenzene unit of the
dienophile was protruding out of the cavity and exposed to
the solvent and the incoming diene. The overall concept relies
on a supramolecular catalytic system based on a chiral
transition-metal complex included in a nonchiral macrocycle.
3.4. Bambus[6]urils
Bambus[6]urils feature a relatively hydrophobic cavity with 12
converging CH-groups that is open at two opposite ends.192
Their name derives from the resemblance of their structure to
that of a bamboo plant (Figure 31a). Bambus[6]urils are
synthesized from the acid-catalyzed condensation of 2,4-
disubstituted-glycoluril unit with paraformaldehyde. In general,
the conjugate base of the halogen acid, i.e., chloride, acts as a
templating agent for the cyclization process. The X-ray
structure of the chloride complex,193 Cl−⊂65, supported the
potential templating eﬀect of the chloride and suggested the
application of bambus[6]urils as receptors for anions in water
solution (Figure 31b).
Glycoluril precursor units that are not soluble in water can
also be condensed with formaldehyde and induced to cyclize in
organic solvents using organic acids (i.e., toluene solvent and
para-toluenesulfonic acid catalyst).192 Under these conditions,
tetra-butylammonium bromide was added as templating agent.
Bambus[6]urils possess some structural features that are
related to those of cucurbit[n]urils and hemicucurbit[n]urils
(not discussed in this review). The bambus[6]urils, like
cucurbit[n]urils, oﬀer a hydrophobic cavity. However, the
cavity of the former is conformationally and structurally more
ﬂexible than that of the latter. The methine hydrogen atoms of
the glycoluril panels in bambus[6]urils are slightly acidic and
oriented toward the interior of the hydrophobic cavity. This
characteristic makes bambus[6]urils eﬃcient receptors for
anions. The bound anion is included in the cavity being
stabilized by 12 weak C−H···X−hydrogen bonds (see section
2). The electrostatic surface potential map of bambus[6]urils
shows a positive region in the interior of the cavity and a
negative region at the portals.193 Moreover, the conformational
ﬂexibility of the cavity of bambus[6]uril allows its adaptation
to anions of diﬀerent sizes and shapes.
Sindelar et al. reported the ﬁrst bambus[6]uril, 65 (Figure
31a), in 2010.193 The bambus[6]uril 65 featuring N-methyl
substituents at the glycoluril panels was not soluble in pure
water. The cavity of 65 had a diameter of 6.4 Å and a depth of
12.7 Å, approximately 4 Å deeper than that of the
cucurbit[6]uril analogue. Titration experiments of receptor
65 with halide anions in a 1:1 water/acetonitrile solvent
mixture showed that the binding constants of the complexes
followed the order: Cl−(Ka = 7.8 × 102 M−1) < Br−(Ka = 4.8
× 104 M−1) < I−(Ka = 8.9 × 105 M−1).193,194
The functionalization of the available nitrogen atoms of the
structure of bambus[6]urils with carboxylic acid groups
produced the water-soluble receptors 66−68 (Figure 31a)
reported by Sindelar and co-workers.195,196 The cavity of
bambus[6]urils accommodated a water molecule in the solid
state. Hence, it was expected the release of the bound molecule
upon anion binding in water solution.4 The bound anion was
then shielded from the bulk aqueous solution. These
considerations suggested that solvation/desolvation processes

these complexes.40,197
Bambus[6]uril 66, bearing 12 benzoic acid groups, was
soluble in water (1 mM, pD = 7.1).195 Note that at this pD,
some of the carboxylic acids of 66 are ionized as carboxylates.
To accurately determine the anion binding constants of 66, 2
× 10−2 M K2DPO4 were added to the solution to control ionic
strength. Binding studies showed the following order of
binding aﬃnities: F−< Cl−< CN−< Br−< NO3
−< BF4
−< I−
< ClO4
−. This trend clearly pointed out that anion desolvation
must play an important role in the binding. The anions
featuring a modest binding aﬃnity, Ka (F−, Cl−, CN−⊂66) =
102−103 M−1, formed kinetically labile complexes, i.e., chemical
exchange was fast on the 1H NMR chemical shift time scale.
On the contrary, anions that bound strongly to the
bambus[6]uril receptor 66, Ka (Br−, NO3
−, BF4
−, I−⊂66) =
105−107 M−1, produced kinetically stable complexes on the 1H
NMR chemical shift time scale (Table 6). For example, the
highest association constant was measured for ClO4
−anion, Ka
(ClO4
−⊂66) = 5.5 × 107 M−1.195 The negatively ionized
benzoic acids of 66 did not seem to compete with the
inorganic anions for the binding pocket of the bambus[6]uril
receptor (vide infra). The modiﬁcation of the pD (7.1−11.3)
did not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the association constant
value determined for the Cl−⊂66 complex. Likewise, the
modiﬁcation of the ionic strength (0.2−0.8 M NaCl) of the
aqueous solutions produced small changes in the stability
constant value of the ClO4
−⊂66 complex. With this ﬁnding,
the authors concluded that the binding strength seemed to
prevail over the “salting-out” eﬀect of the salt195,196 (see
Hofmeister eﬀect in section 2.2). In addition, ITC experiments
revealed that anion binding to 66 was driven by enthalpy and
opposed by entropy (e.g., Ka (I−⊂66) = 2.0 × 106 M−1; ΔH =
−84.1 kJ·mol−1 and TΔS = −47.5 kJ·mol−1 in water at pH =
7.1).195
The bambus[6]urils 67 and 68 (Figure 31a) had pentyl and
propyl substituents, respectively, which were functionalized
with terminal carboxylic acids.196 Receptors 67 and 68 were
soluble in phosphate aqueous buﬀer at pD = 7.5. As indicated
above for 66, some of the carboxylic acids of 67 and 68 are
ionized as carboxylates. The binding constant values of the
receptor’s series for Br−and I−decreased in the same order: 66
> 67 > 68 (Table 6). The observed trend was explained by
considering a competitive intramolecular binding of the
carboxylate groups for the receptor’s cavity and the establish-
ment of repulsive Coulombic interactions between the
carboxylate groups and the bound anion. Remarkably, the
crystal structure of 67 showed the inclusion of two of its
carboxylate arms in the receptor’s cavity. A water molecule
bridged the two carboxylate groups (Figure 32). In addition,
the authors suggested that the aliphatic carboxylates of 67 and
68 were able to establish more eﬀective electrostatic repulsions
with bound anions than the rigid benzoates present in 66. For
example, the binding constant values determined for I−were
Ka (I−⊂67) = 1.1 × 106 M−1 and Ka (I−⊂68) = 2.1 × 105
M−1.196 This result was rationalized assuming that the short
propyl substituents of 68 brought the carboxylate groups close
to the portals of the receptor disfavoring anion binding.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that biotin[6]uril, i.e., a
macrocycle formed by the condensation of six units of D-biotin
and formaldehyde, developed by the group of Pittelkow,198
resembles the structure of a bambus[6]uril. Biotin[6]uril bears
six carboxylic acid groups providing water solubility. The
binding constants of biotin[6]uril with the halide anions
followed the same order observed for bambus[6]urils, i.e., Cl−
< Br−< I−.198 For example, the binding constant value of the
I−⊂biotin[6]uril complex was determined to be 2.5 × 103 M−1
in phosphate buﬀer at pD ∼7.5.199 The binding process was
driven by enthalpy, ΔH = −42.8 kJ·mol−1, and opposed by
entropy, TΔS = −23.0 kJ·mol−1. Note that the binding
constant of I−decreased almost 3 orders of magnitude with
respect to that determined for bambus[6]uril 67 (Ka (I−⊂67)
= 1.1 × 106 M−1). The diﬀerence in binding aﬃnity between
biotin[6]uril and bambus[6]uril toward halide anions may be
related to the diﬀerent solvation modes of the corresponding
receptor’s cavities. In the solid state, two water molecules
occupied the cavity of biotin[6]uril,199 whereas the cavity of
bambus[6]uril 67 showed one bound water molecule.196

HYDROPHOBIC CAVITY
In this section, we discuss covalent receptors displaying a
concave hydrophobic cavity closed at one end and open at the
opposite end. The concave and aromatic cavity is shallow in
the case of calix[n]arenes and resorcin[4]arenes but becomes
deeper for cavitands derived from resorcin[4]arene scaﬀolds.

conformations in solution, i.e., cone, pinched cone, and

alternate, owing, in some cases, to the rotation of the aromatic
panels around the methylene bridges. The interconversion rate
between conformers depends on the size of the substituents
attached to the aromatic panels. The calix[4]arenes in cone
conformation display a shallow aromatic cavity widely open at
one end and closed at the opposite8 (Figure 33c).
The structure of calix[n]arenes can be modiﬁed at either the
lower and/or the upper rim. In this regard, water-soluble
calix[n]arenes have been prepared by appending carboxylic
acid, phosphonate, sulfonate, or ammonium groups at their
rims.15,49 The shallow hydrophobic cavity of calix[n]arenes do
not isolate bound water molecules from the bulk solution, i.e.,
they are able to establish hydrogen bonds with water molecules
in the bulk. Accordingly, there is not expected to be a large and
favorable enthalpic contribution to guest binding from the
release of bound water molecules. X-ray crystallographic
studies performed by Atwood et al.200 and later by Steed et
al.201 showed that calix[4]arenes can bind one water molecule,
which is stabilized by OH−π and dispersion interactions. On
the contrary, calix[5]arenes can accommodate up to three
water molecules in their cavity, as reported by Steed, Atwood,
Clark, and co-workers202 (see hydration of cavities in section
2.1).
Calix[4]arenes, such as 69 (Figure 33a), were found to bind
inorganic cations in water.15 For example, Morel and Morel-
Desrosiers showed that monocharged cations and tetra-
sulfonate calix[4]arene 694−formed 1:1 complexes featuring
an inclusion binding geometry in water at pH = 2.203 The
binding process was found to be enthalpically driven, in part,
owing to the establishment of cation−π interactions (see
sections 2 and 3.1). However, doubly charged cations also
interacted with the sulfonate groups at the upper rim of the
receptor 694−, as shown by Morel and Morel-Desrosiers203 and
Bonal et al.204 As might be expected for ion-pairing interactions
in water, the binding processes of the dicationic guests were
mainly driven by entropy.
Calix[4]arene receptors also bind neutral and charged
organic substrates leading to 1:1 inclusion complexes in
water.15 Typically, the guest is included in the shallow
hydrophobic cavity of the calix[4]arene.69 The binding process
induces the receptor to adopt the cone conformation (Figure
33c). Furthermore, the formation of the inclusion complex
produces the maximization of the host−guest intermolecular
interactions and a reduction in the overall solvent accessible
surface area. The cone (or pinched cone) conformer of
calix[4]arenes can be identiﬁed by the observation of two
separate signals for the hydrogen atoms of the methylene
bridges in the 1H NMR spectrum.205 At the same time, the
proton signals of the bound guests experience upﬁeld shifts
owing to the shielding eﬀect exerted by the aromatic cavity of
the receptor. For example, a hydrogen nucleus in the deepest
region of the calix[4]arene’s cavity displays a complexation-
induced shift of Δδ ∼−2 ppm.15 In most calix[4]arene
complexes, the chemical exchange between free and bound
components is fast on the 1H NMR chemical shift time scale.
The inclusion complexes of sulfonate calix[4]arenes and
positively charged organic guests, such as organic ammonium
cations, were stabilized by the HE, CH−π, cation−π, and
Coulombic interactions. For example, Shinkai et al. reported
that the adamantane trimethylammonium 17+ (added as
chloride salt, Figure 5) and tetra-sulfonate calix[4]arene 694−
formed a 1:1 complex featuring a binding constant of Ka
(17+⊂694−) = 2.1 × 104 M−1 in 0.1 M phosphate buﬀer at pD
= 7.3.206−208 In the 17+⊂694−complex, either the adamantane
residue or the trimethylammonium group could be buried in
the cavity of the receptor. Indeed, the two binding geometries
of the 17+⊂694−complex were present in solution and were
involved in a chemical exchange process that was fast on the
1H NMR chemical shift time scale. The existence in solution of
the two binding modes served to explain the chemical shift
changes observed in the 1H NMR spectra of the 1:1 complexes
formed between calix[4]arene 694−with phenyl trimethylam-
monium 76+ and benzyl trimethylammonium 77+ as guests206
(Figure 33b and Table 7). That is, the observed upﬁeld shifts
experienced by the signals of the aromatic protons and the
trimethylammonium groups supported the two possible
orientations of the bound guests. Liu et al. reported the
binding constant value of 1-methylpyridinium with calix[4]-
arene 694−as Ka = 6.4 × 105 M−1 in water.209 In this case, the
pyridinium cation was selectively included in the calix[4]-
arene’s cavity. Liu et al. also investigated the complexation
process of bipyridinium209,210 and biguanidinium211 guests
with calix[4]arene 694−in water solution.
Arena, Sciotto, Ungaro, and co-workers studied the binding
properties of calix[4]arenes 70 and 71 toward organic
ammonium cations212 (Figure 33a). The calix[4]arenes 70

phosphate buﬀer solution at pD = 7.3 owing to the ionization
of the carboxylic groups installed at their lower rims. The
incorporated lower rim functions were also useful in locking
the receptors’ cone conformation. The number and placement
(upper and lower rim) of the charged substituents in the
calix[4]arenes had a signiﬁcant eﬀect in the binding modes and
association constant values of their complexes with the

alkylammonium cations. For example, in the 76+⊂[70-4H]4−
complex, the trimethylammonium group of 76+ (phenyl
trimethylammonium) was exclusively included in the aromatic
cavity of the lower rim tetra-carboxylate calix[4]arene [70-
4H]4−establishing cation−π and CH−π interactions. In
striking contrast, for the 76+⊂[71-4H]8−complex, the guest
was exclusively bound to the tetra-sulfonate tetra-carboxylate
calix[4]arene [71-4H]8−through the inclusion of its phenyl
ring and the establishment of π−π and CH−π interactions.
Simultaneously, the trimethylammonium group of bound 76+
in the 76+⊂[71-4H]8−complex interacted through Coulombic
interactions with the upper rim sulfonate substituents of the
host. The diﬀerent binding modes and intermolecular
interactions present in complexes 76+⊂[70-4H]4−and
76+⊂[71-4H]8−translated into a diﬀerence of just 1 order of
magnitude between their association constant values in favor of
the ditopic 76+⊂[71-4H]8−complex (Table 7).
The 1:1 inclusion complex of benzyl trimethylammonium
77+ (Figure 33b) with the lower rim substituted tetra-
carboxylate calix[4]arene [70-4H]4−displayed a binding
geometry similar to that discussed above for the 76+⊂[70-
4H]4−counterpart212 that was selective inclusion of the
trimethylammonium knob. However, the binding constant
value of the latter complex, 77+⊂[70-4H]4−, suﬀered a 3-fold
drop in binding aﬃnity (Ka (77+⊂[70-4H]4−) = 50 M−1)
compared to that of the former. In striking contrast and quite
surprisingly to us, the 77+⊂[71-4H]8−complex displayed, in
solution, two binding geometries that were rapidly inter-
converting on the 1H NMR chemical shift time scale (Figure
34). The binding constant values determined for the 76+⊂[71-
4H]8−and 77+⊂[71-4H]8−complexes turned out to be
identical (Table 7). It is worth mentioning that the tetra-
sulfonate tetra-carboxylate calix[4]arene [71-4H]8−included
the phenyl trimethylammoniun guest, 76+, in a single binding
geometry due to a preferred ditopic interaction with the
guest.213 A subtle change in the structure of the guest (addition
of a methylene group in 77+) had a signiﬁcant but diﬃcult to
predict impact either on the thermodynamic stabilities or the
binding modes of the complexes with the two studied hosts,
[70-4H]4−and [71-4H]8−.
The binding of amino acids and short peptides in water has
been investigated using tetra-sulfonate receptor 694−and larger
calix[n]arene homologues (vide infra). For example, Morel-
Desrosiers et al. reported the formation of 1:1 inclusion
complexes between protonated
L-lysine [78+H]+ and
L-
arginine [79+H]+ (Figure 33b) with tetra-sulfonate calix[4]-
arene 694−.214 The amino acid complexes, [78+H]+⊂694−and
[79+H]+⊂694−, featured binding constant values in the order
of 103 M−1 in phosphate buﬀer at pH = 8 (Table 7).
Furthermore, di- and tripeptides containing L-lysine and L-
arginine residues were also bound to the sulfonate receptor
694−. On the basis of the results obtained by 1D and 2D NMR
experiments, the protonated terminal amine of
L-lysine
[78+H]+ and the guanidinium group of L-arginine [79+H]+
were selectively included in the shallow hydrophobic cavity of
calix[4]arene 694−. Hof et al. investigated the binding of L-
lysine at diﬀerent methylation states (KMen
+, n = 3 −1) to
calix[4]arene 694−in 4 × 10−2 M phosphate buﬀer at pH =
7.4.215 The complex between ζ-trimethylammonium L-lysine
(KMe3
+) and calix[4]arene 694−featured the largest binding
constant value of the methylated
L-lysine series, Ka
(KMe3
+⊂694−) = 3.6 × 104 M−1. The KMe3
+⊂694−complex
was stabilized by the HE, Coulombic, and cation−π
interactions, in part, owing to the inclusion of the
trimethylammonium knob of the guest in the receptor’s cavity.
Later, Hof et al. developed trisulfonate calix[4]arene receptors
in order to improve the binding selectivity toward KMe3
+.216
The replacement of a phenyl sulfonate panel of calix[4]arene
694−by a biphenyl group boosted the binding constant of
KMe3
+ up to 8.0 × 104 M−1 (see ethenoanthracene-based
cyclophanes for the selective binding of KMe3
+ in section 3.1).
Calix[4]arene receptors decorated with phosphonic acids at
their upper rims were also used by Rachon et al. for the binding
of amino acid methyl esters in water.217
Calix[4]arene receptors bearing alkylammonium substitu-
ents at their upper rims were eﬃcient receptors for the
complexation of nucleotides in water. For example, the upper
rim substituted tetra-trimethylammonium calix[4]arene tetra-
chloride salt 72 (Figure 33a), reported by Shi and Schneider,
was soluble in water.218 Calix[4]arene 72 adopted a ﬁxed cone
conformation owing to the appended propyl substituents at its
lower rim, i.e., the energy barrier for the rotation of the
aromatic panels around the methylene bridges increased
signiﬁcantly. The tetra-ammonium receptor 724+ recognized
adenosine monophosphate (AMP2−), diphosphate (ADP3−),
and triphosphate (ATP4−) derivatives in water at pD ∼7. The
ammonium cations of 724+ were involved in Coulombic
interactions with the phosphate residues of the bound
nucleotide. The proposed binding geometry of the complexes
placed the saccharide residue of the bound nucleotide partially
included in the aromatic cavity of the receptor and the adenine
unit totally exposed to the bulk solvent. The magnitude of the
binding constant values for these complexes were in line with
the thermodynamic stability for the formation of two salt-
bridges in water, Ka = 103−104 M−1 (see section 2). An
increasing trend in the Ka magnitude with the overall charge of
the guest was observed (Table 7).
Steed, Atwood, Clark, and co-workers reported that the
calix[5]arene 73 (Figure 33a) possessed ﬁve to seven negative
charges, depending on the pH of the aqueous solution, owing
to the presence of ﬁve sulfonate groups at its upper rim and the
potential ionization of one or two phenolic OHs at its lower
rim.202 Later, Sciotto et al. reported the molecular recognition
properties of the penta-sodium salt of penta-sulfonate
calix[5]arene 73 in water (0.1 M phosphate buﬀer at pD =
7.3) using a series of organic ammonium guests219 and amino
acids.220 For example, benzyl trimethylammonium 77+ and the
hexa-anionic form of calix[5]arene [73-H]6−formed a 1:1
inclusion complex featuring an association constant Ka = 1.0 ×
104 M−1. NMR and molecular modeling studies (MM3) of the

77+⊂[73-H]6−complex suggested that the guest was included
in the electron-rich aromatic cavity of the receptor with a tilted
orientation (Figure 35). The binding constants of amino acids,
such as monocationic
L-lysine [78+H]+ and
L-arginine
[79+H]+ (Figure 33b), with the hexa-anionic calix[5]arene
[73-H]6−were 1 order of magnitude lower than those of the
same guests with analogous tetra-sulfonate calix[4]arenes
(Table 7). Nevertheless, similar binding modes were proposed
for the diﬀerent complexes.
The hexa-sodium salt of hexa-sulfonate calix[6]arene 74
(Figure 33a) featured eight negative charges in neutral water
solution: six sulfonates at the upper rim and two ionized
phenolic OHs at the lower rim, [74-2H]8−. In the solid state,
Atwood, Clark, and co-workers showed that the ionized
calix[6]arene [74-2H]8−adopted a double partial cone
conformation stabilized by four intramolecular hydrogen
bonds221 (Figure 36). Most likely, this conformation is also
present in water solution. The octa-anionic calix[6]arene [74-
2H]8−formed a 1:1 inclusion complex with trimethylammo-
nium adamantane guest 17+ (added as chloride salt) featuring
a binding constant value of Ka = 1.0 × 103 M−1.207 This
binding constant was 1 order of magnitude lower than the one
determined for the 17+⊂694−complex (i.e., calix[4]arene
receptor). The host−guest intermolecular interactions (non-
polar contacts and Coulombic forces) were not optimal in the
17+⊂[74-2H]8−complex, producing a decrease in the expected
binding aﬃnity based on the overall charge of the receptor.
The interaction of ferrocene derivatives with octa-anionic
calix[6]arene receptor [74-2H]8−was also investigated in
aqueous solution by Gokel, Kaifer, and co-workers.222 Neutral
ferrocene 52 (Figure 22) and octa-anionic calix[6]arene [74-
2H]8−formed a 1:1 inclusion complex. The inclusion
geometry of the complex was supported by the observed
chemical shift changes in the 1H NMR spectra of titration
experiments. The binding constant value of the 52⊂[74-2H]8−
complex was determined as Ka = 3.7 × 103 M−1 in water
solution. As expected, the use of cationic ferrocene guests
produced an increase in binding aﬃnity up to 104 M−1.
In the same vein, the hepta-sodium salt of hepta-sulfonate
calix[7]arene 75 (Figure 33a), reported by Vasca, Neri, and co-
workers, possessed nine negatively charged groups, i.e., [75-
2H]9−, in aqueous solution at pD = 7.3.223 The structure of
calix[7]arene was conformationally ﬂexible. Therefore, [75-
2H]9−adopted multiple conformations in aqueous solution.
The X-ray crystal structure of 75 and in silico calculations
indicated that a double cone pinched conformation was
energetically favored. Calix[7]arene [75-2H]9−also featured a
large aromatic surface area enabling the binding of aromatic
guests. For example, this receptor bound dimethyl viologen
282+ (Figure 14b) in water, forming a thermodynamically
highly stable 1:1 complex (Table 7). The preferred binding
geometry of the 282+⊂[75-2H]9−complex was diﬃcult to
elucidate experimentally. Most likely, the 282+⊂[75-2H]9−
complex was present in multiple binding geometries that
were involved in fast chemical exchange processes on the NMR
chemical shift time scale.
Finally, chiral groups were also incorporated at the upper
rim of water-soluble sulfonate224 and carboxylate225 calix[n]-
arenes. These calix[n]arenes were applied for the chiral
recognition of α-amino acids and their methyl ester derivatives.
They showed modest levels of binding selectivity for methyl
esters of
D-tryptophan and
D-phenylalanine versus the
L-
counterparts.225 Deep-cavity calix[n]arenes were also intro-
duced in the literature, providing association constant values in
the order of 104−105 M−1 for aromatic cationic guests, such as
76+ and 77+.226,227
4.2. Resorcin[4]arenes
The cyclic covalent arrangement of four electron-rich
resorcinol units provides the resorcin[4]arene scaﬀold. The
resorcinol aromatic panels are connected by methine bridges
bearing alkyl substituents (aka “feet”). The OH phenol
functions of the resorcin[4]arene scaﬀold form a cyclic seam
of hydrogen bonds, which can be reinforced by hydrogen-
bonded water molecules.228 These inter- and intramolecular
hydrogen-bonding interactions stabilize the cone conformer of
resorcin[4]arene (C4 symmetry) in close analogy to that of
calix[4]arenes unsubstituted at their lower rim (Figure 37 and
Figure 33, respectively). The resorcin[4]arene in the cone
conformation displays a shallow concave hydrophobic cavity.
An included atomic nucleus in the deepest region of the
aromatic cavity of resorcin[4]arenes experiences a strong
upﬁeld shift of Δδ ∼−2.5 ppm.229 The dynamics of the
chemical exchange processes between free and bound
components of complexes derived from resorcin[4]arenes are

fast on the 1H NMR chemical shift time scale. We will show
below (end of this section) that resorcin[4]arenes featuring a
deep aromatic cavity, aka deep cavitands, show remarkably
diﬀerent binding exchange dynamics compared to the shallow
parent derivatives.
As described for calix[4]arenes, ionizable or charged groups,
e.g., carboxylic acids, sulfonates, phosphates, and ammonium,15
were attached at either the upper and lower rims of the
resorcin[4]arene scaﬀold with the aim to impart water
solubility to their derivatives. For example, the resorcin[4]-
arene bearing four terminal sulfonate groups at its lower rim
alkyl substituents, 80 (Figure 37a), was highly soluble in water.
Aoyama et al. demonstrated that tetra-anionic sulfonate
resorcin[4]arene 804−formed 1:1 inclusion complexes with
cyclic and acyclic alcohols.229 These complexes showed the
nonpolar section of the cyclic alcohol, i.e., 82 and 83 (Figure
37c), buried in the cavity of the receptor and the hydroxyl
group of the bound guest remained exposed to the bulk
aqueous solution (Figure 38). The binding constant values of
the latter complexes were determined to be lower than 20 M−1
in D2O (Table 8). Nevertheless, the analogous para-methyl-
substituted tetra-sulfonate resorcin[4]arene 814−(Figure 37a)
featured binding constants up to 102 M−1 with the same
alcohols (Table 8). The increase in binding aﬃnity resulted
from the deeper hydrophobic cavity featured by 814−in
comparison to that of 804−lacking the para-methyl
substituents.56
It is worth mentioning that the installation of charged
groups at the lower rim of the resorcin[4]arene receptors did
not interfere with the kinetic and thermodynamic character-
istics of the binding processes with charged guests.229 On the
contrary, when the same charged groups were implemented at
the upper rim of the receptors, the resulting inclusion
complexes experienced noticeable diﬀerences in thermody-
namic and kinetic stabilities in response to the sign of the
guest’s charge (vide infra).
Diederich et al. elaborated the aromatic cavity of the
resorcin[4]arene scaﬀold by functionalizing the resorcinol
units at their para-position with phenyl substituents,230 84
(Figure 39). In addition, the authors used ethylene chains to
bridge the resorcinol OHs of the receptor’s scaﬀold. The
incorporation of the ethylene bridges produced a conforma-
tionally more rigid and preorganized receptor structure, aka
cavitand.231 These structural modiﬁcations were expected to
enhance the HE (see section 2.1) for the binding of nonpolar
residues or substrates. Cavitand 84 was further decorated with
four amidinium groups at its upper rim and four tri(ethylene
glycol) monomethyl ether chains at its “feet”. The upper and
lower rim substituents warranted water solubility to 84. The
cationic amidinium groups also assisted the binding of guests
having negatively charged complementary functions.
The tetra-cationic cavitand 844+ was used for the binding of
carboxylate anions in water.230 Isophthalates, such as 852−
(Figure 40), formed 1:1 and 2:1 guest/host complexes with
receptor 844+ in pure D2O (Ka (852−⊂844+) = 8.6 × 104 M−1
and Ka (852−⊂844+ ⇌[852]4−⊂844+) = 7.7 × 103 M−1). In
striking contrast, 1:1 complexes were exclusively formed in 5 ×
10−3 M aqueous borate buﬀer solution at pH = 9.2 (Figure
41). The binding constant value of the 1:1 inclusion complex,
852−⊂844+, in buﬀer solution was in line with that determined
in pure water (Table 8). The deep inclusion of isophthalate
852−in the cavity of receptor 844+ was driven by the HE with
the assistance of electrostatic interactions: ion-pairing and
hydrogen-bonding (see section 2). These results demonstrated
that the formation of high stoichiometry complexes mainly
stabilized by means of electrostatic interactions could be
suppressed in certain buﬀer solutions.15,136,232
Following a diﬀerent approach, Rebek and co-workers
bridged the resorcinol OHs of the resorcin[4]arene scaﬀold
with aromatic panels.232 These resorcin[4]arene derivatives are
known as deep cavitands. Deep cavitands soluble in organic

solvents were originally introduced by Cram et al.233,234 Water-
soluble deep cavitands are present in solution mainly as D2d
“velcrand” dimers. In turn, “velcrand” dimers are in equilibrium
with monomeric C2v “kite” conformers. Moreover, “kite”
conformers are also in equilibrium with C4v “vase” counter-
parts.235 The two monomeric free conformers are present in
low abundance in water solution (Figure 42). The dimerization
of resorcin[4]arene cavitands into “velcrands” is driven by the
HE (see section 2.1). Interestingly, the “kite” conformer
features a shallow aromatic cavity, whereas the “vase”
counterpart displays a deep hydrophobic cavity. Neither the
“velcrand” dimer nor the “kite” conformer are able to establish
highly thermodynamically and kinetically stable host−guest
inclusion complexes. Nevertheless, the binding of size and
shape complementary guests with the monomeric “vase”
conformer induces the resorcin[4]arene dimer to dissociate.
The bound receptor in “vase” conformation maximizes
nonpolar contacts and minimizes the solvent accessible surface
area. It is worth mentioning that the 1H NMR spectrum of the
“vase” conformer displays the hydrogen atom of the alkyl
substituted methine as a triplet resonating at δ ∼5.5
ppm.235,236 This signal is signiﬁcantly shielded in the “kite”
conformer owing to the equatorial orientation of the aromatic
bridging panels. The chemical exchange between the free
conformers of the monomeric cavitands (“kite” and “vase”) is
slow on the 1H NMR chemical shift time scale. Moreover, the
high-energy barrier for the conformational exchange is the
main contributor in controlling the guest in/out slow exchange
kinetics of the “vase” complexes.237 Thus, it is expected for
resorcin[4]arene deep cavitands to produce “vase” inclusion
complexes that are kinetically stable on the 1H NMR chemical
shift time scale.
Water-solubilizing groups were appended at the “feet” of
resorcin[4]arene deep cavitands: amine,235 oligo(ethylene
glycol),238 pyridinium,239 imidazolium,240 and guanidinium
groups.241 Cavitand 86 possessed four ammonium groups at
the lower rim and eight amide functions at its upper rim235
(Figure 39). Both amides and ammonium groups imparted
water solubility. In the “vase”, the upper rim amides formed a
belt of eight hydrogen bonds that stabilized the conformation
(aka self-folding cavitand). The upper rim amide groups could
also assist the binding of guests bearing complementary polar
functions. Tetra-ammonium deep cavitand 864+ included size
complementary neutral guests. The formed 1:1 complexes
featured stability constant values of the order of 102 M−1. For
example, 864+ formed a thermodynamically and kinetically
stable 1:1 inclusion complex with adamantanone 87 (Figure
40) in water235 (Table 8). The adamantane residue of bound
87 was buried in the deep aromatic binding pocket of 864+ in
the “vase” conformation. The carbonyl group of the bound
guest was located close to the open end of the cavity remaining
partially exposed to the bulk aqueous solution (Figure 43).

The replacement of the cationic ammonium groups at the
lower rim of 864+ with oligo(ethylene glycol) chains produced
the neutral deep cavitand 88238 (Figure 39). The oligo-
(ethylene glycol) chains provided water solubility of 88 over a
wide pH range. Receptor 88 complexed protonated
adamantane amines and methyl-quinuclidinium guests featur-
ing Ka values up to 102 M−1. The complexation process of the
cationic guests with the neutral deep cavitand was driven by
entropy. This thermodynamic signature was assigned to the
partial desolvation of the charged group of the guest upon
inclusion in the deep aromatic cavity of the host.
The Rebek group also used as aromatic panels of the
resorcin[4]arene deep cavitands benzimidazole units with
anionic and cationic substituents, 89237 and 90242 (Figure 39).
The charged groups at the upper rim of the receptors induced
their solubility in water. For example, the tetra-carboxylate

bonded bridging water molecules located between adjacent
benzimidazole units of 894−further stabilized the “vase”
conformation (Figure 44). The binding of a complementary

eight aromatic panels that surround them.232 For example, a
nucleus of an atom located in the deepest region of the cavity
displayed an upﬁeld shift of Δδ = −4.4 to −4.9 ppm. The tetra-
carboxylate cavitand 894−and the tetra-methylammonium
cation formed a 1:1 inclusion complex featuring a binding
constant of Ka = 4.3 × 103 M−1.237 On the other hand, cationic
guests featuring nonpolar alkyl residues displayed binding
constant values larger than 104 M−1. In this regard, choline 91+
(Figure 40) and acetylcholine formed thermodynamically and
kinetically highly stable 1:1 inclusion complexes with 894−in
water (Figure 44). In general, the binding processes of these
cavitands were mainly enthalpically driven.
Deep cavitands 89 and 90 were structurally closely related
(Figure 39). They only diﬀered in the type of substituents
present at their upper rims: carboxylates in 894−and
alkylammonium cations in 904+. The two cavitands were
applied by Rebek et al. to investigate the eﬀect of the charge
complementarity between host and guest on the binding
aﬃnity in water.242 The obtained results indicated that the
diﬀerence in binding aﬃnities (Ka) of a pair of complexes of
the two hosts with the same charged guest, e.g., adamantane
bearing a carboxylate or ammonium group, was around 1 order
of magnitude. This ﬁnding evidenced that charge comple-
mentarity is also required for eﬃcient binding between charged
partners even in water. A similar result was disclosed previously
in the section dedicated to cyclophane receptors (section 3.1).
Not surprisingly, neutral adamantane guests displayed similar
binding aﬃnities for both cavitands.
Long-alkyl chain guests were bound with unusual con-
formations in the hydrophobic cavity of benzimidazole deep
cavitands.232 Trembleau and Rebek observed that surfactants,
such as dodecyl sulfate 92 (SDS) and dodecyl phosphocholine
93 (DPC) (Figure 40), adopted a helical conformation when
included in the deep cavity of tetra-carboxylate 894−in
water.243 The terminal methyl group of the bound guest was
located in the deepest region of the receptor’s cavity, whereas
the polar head protruded from the cavity and remained
exposed to the bulk aqueous solution. Interestingly, the buried
section of the aliphatic chain of 92−and 93 featured a
condensed coiled conformation which ﬁlled better the cavity
volume and established a larger number of CH−π interactions
(see section 2) with the aromatic walls of the receptor 894−
(Figure 45). Note that the helical arrangement of the alkyl
chain of the bound surfactant was ca. 13 kJ·mol−1 higher in
energy than the extended counterpart (2.1−2.5 kJ·mol−1 per
gauche interaction). Nevertheless, the gain in free energy of
binding overcame the energetic cost of the guest to adopt the
coiled structure owing to the existence of a larger number of
intermolecular interactions than in a fully extended con-
formation of the guest.
The coiled helical arrangement adopted by polar guests with
long-alkyl chains when included in the cavity of 894−was also
observed for linear hydrocarbons.244 Interestingly, the
1H
NMR spectrum of the 1:1 inclusion complex of n-octane 94
(Figure 40) with deep cavitand 894−showed a set of upﬁeld
shifted signals for the protons of the bound guest displaying an
unexpected symmetrical pattern (only four methylene signals
were observed). The comparison of the 1H NMR spectrum for
the complex of n-octane, 94⊂894−with that of the bound
surfactant 92−(SDS) suggested that the chemical shift of the
four signals assigned to the methyl and methylene protons of
bound n-octane 94 were, in fact, the average of the two
diﬀerent magnetic environments experienced by the α- and ω-
methyl moieties, the α + 1 and ω −1 methylenes, and so on.
The signal pattern and the chemical shift values of the protons
of bound 94 were in agreement with a compact, coiled
structure experiencing a fast tumbling motion on the chemical
shift time scale (Figure 46). In contrast, shorter n-alkanes, such
as n-pentane, featured fully extended carbon-chain conforma-
tions in the bound form.245
Alternative water-soluble resorcin[4]arene cavitands display-
ing deep hydrophobic cavities were designed by Gibb et al.,
95246 and 96247 (Figure 39). Gibb’s deep-cavity cavitands
incorporated four water-solubilizing groups at the upper and
four more at the lower rim. Gibb’s cavitands featured a
conformationally rigid “vase” conformation in water. In
particular, the octa-acid cavitand 95 was soluble in neutral
water at micromolar concentrations. The solubilization of 95 in
water at millimolar concentrations required a pH increase >9.
The cavitand 96 bearing eight peripheral quaternary
ammonium groups was structurally analogous to the octa-
acid 95. The open-end of the cavity in the Gibb’s cavitands was
surrounded by a large hydrophobic section suggesting that

these cavitands could have a tendency to self-associate into
high-order aggregates14 (see section 6.2).
Gibb and Gibb applied the octa-acid 95 to investigate the
Hofmeister eﬀect (see section 2.2) in its binding processes
with nonpolar residues.248 The use of synthetic model systems
is of great importance for our further understanding of the
Hofmeister eﬀect in natural complexes. In a 10−2 M phosphate
water-buﬀered solution at pH = 11.3, the interaction between
the adamantane carboxylic acid 97 (Figure 40) and the octa-
acid 95 produced a 1:1 inclusion complex. At pH = 11.3, all
carboxylic acid groups of the host 95 and the guest 97 were
ionized as carboxylates: octa-acid 95 was converted into the
octa-carboxylate [95-8H]8−and 97 was converted into the
carboxylate [97-H]−. In the inclusion complex [97-H]−⊂[95-
8H]8−, the adamantane group of [97-H]−was deeply included
in the hydrophobic cavity of [95-8H]8−. On the other hand,
the carboxylate group of bound [97-H]−protruded out of the
cavity and remained exposed to the bulk aqueous solution. The
protrusion of the guest’s carboxylate prevented the dimeriza-
tion of the bound cavitand octa-carboxylate [95-8H]8−. The
binding constant value for the [97-H]−⊂[95-8H]8−complex
was determined to be Ka = 4.7 × 106 M−1 (ΔG = −38.1 kJ·
mol−1). In the presence of “salting-out” anions (F−and
SO4
2−), the free energy of binding for the [97-H]−⊂[95-8H]8−
complex was favored by ca. 2.1 kJ·mol−1. This result was in
agreement with the enhancement of the HE exerted by
“salting-out” anions. In contrast, the presence of “salting-in”
anions (I−, SCN−, and ClO4
−) were detrimental for the
binding process. For example, the reduction in the binding free
energy of the [97-H]−⊂[95-8H]8−complex was notable in the
presence of perchlorate, ca. 4.2 kJ·mol−1.
The binding of the adamantane carboxylate [97-H]−to the
hydrophobic cavity of [95-8H]8−in phosphate buﬀer solution
was driven by enthalpy. In striking contrast, the same
complexation process in the presence of 0.1 M NaClO4 was
driven by entropy. Interestingly, the detailed analysis of the 1H
NMR titration spectra of ClO4
−with octa-carboxylate cavitand
[95-8H]8−revealed that the “salting-in” anion interacted with
the receptor forming a 1:1 host/guest inclusion complex. The
binding constant value determined for the ClO4
−⊂[95-8H]8−
complex was 95 M−1. Therefore, at high NaClO4 concen-
trations, the “salting-in” anion eﬀectively competed with the
binding of a convex hydrophobe, i.e., the adamantane residue
of [97-H]−, for the hydrophobic binding pocket of [95-8H]8−.
A further-reaching conclusion of this work was that the
interaction of “salting-in” anions with concave nonpolar
aromatic regions might be the basis of the mechanism of the
“salting-in” eﬀect that they produce on protein solutions. The
correct location of four methyl groups at the portal of a slightly
more lipophilic version of receptor [95-8H]8−induced the
spontaneous drying of its nonpolar binding site (see section
2.1).80
Geremia, Dalcanale, and co-workers introduced tetra-
phosphonate resorcin[4]arene cavitands with pyridinium
“feet”. For example, the tetra-phosphonate cavitand 98 bear
four PO groups inwardly directed with respect to the cavity
of the receptor249 (Figure 39). The X-ray crystal structures of
structurally related tetra-phosphonate cavitands showed that
water molecules interacted with the polar functions, but the
cavity of the receptors was “dry”. This observation suggested
that the cavity of the resorcin[4]arene 98 was poorly solvated
also in aqueous solution.
The tetra-phosphonate tetra-pyridinium cavitand 984+ was
shown to be an eﬃcient receptor for N-methylated amino acids
in water.249 The stability constants for the 1:1 inclusion
complexes were calculated to be in the range of Ka = 103−104
M−1. The binding processes were characterized by a favorable
enthalpy term and opposed entropy. For example, the 1:1
inclusion complex of the methyl ester of N-methyl glycine, 99+
(Figure 40), and the tetra-phosphonate receptor 984+ displayed
the N-methyl group of the guest buried in the cavity of the
receptor (Table 8). Therefore, the binding of the ammonium
cation residue of 99+ was stabilized through cation−dipole and
hydrogen-bonding interactions with the PO groups of the
receptor (Figure 47). Amino acids lacking N-methylation were
not bound by the tetra-phosphonate cavitand 984+ in water.
Yu, Rebek, and co-workers applied benzimidazolone
resorcin[4]arene cavitands 100 and 101 (Figure 39) to
mediate/catalyze chemical transformations in water.250 For
example, the tetra-cationic cavitand 1004+ was able to bind
long-chain α,ω-amino acids in a folded conformation.240 The
binding geometry of the complex brought in close proximity
the terminal amino and acid groups of the guest. In this
arrangement, the intramolecular cyclization reaction of the
bound amino acid to produce the corresponding lactam was
favored. Therefore, the cyclization of α,ω-amino acid 102 gave
the 12-membered ring lactam 103 with a 4-fold yield
improvement in the presence of the cavitand 1004+ (Figure
48) compared to the same reaction in the bulk. Most likely, the
yield of the lactam was higher in the presence of the cavitand
because the competitive intermolecular reactions leading to
oligomeric products were not favored.
The mediation of intramolecular cyclization reactions of
long-chain substrates required the use of cavitand 100 in
stoichiometric amounts. This limitation was somehow
alleviated by the fact that the chaperone cavitand 100 could
be reused after product extraction with an organic solvent. The
Rebek group reported other examples of mediated cyclization
reactions using benzimidazolone resorcin[4]arene deep
cavitands as synthetic chaperones.251,252
Another application of benzimidazolone cavitands consisted
of the monofunctionalization of dissymmetric compounds (i.e.,
desymmetrization). When two functional groups present in the
same molecule are totally independent, they exhibit equal
reaction rate constants leading to a mixture of products. For
example, consider the reaction of a difunctional symmetric
compound, A, to give the monofunctionalized product, B, with

a rate constant k1 (A →B), followed by the reaction of B to
yield the direacted compound, C, with a rate constant k2 (B →
C). In the case that k1 = k2, the upper limit for the yield of the
monoreacted compound B is 36.8%.253 This outcome
complicates the puriﬁcation and isolation of the synthetically
valuable monoreacted (nonsymmetric) product. Using the
deep cavitand 101, long-chain α,ω-difunctional substrates were
quantitatively bound in water solution at millimolar concen-
tration to form 1:1 inclusion complexes.
For example, the long-chain diester 104 included in the
tetra-cationic cavitand 1014+ experienced a chemical exchange
process that was fast on the chemical shift time scale between
two J-conformations, most likely through a “yo-yo” motion253
(Scheme 4). This motion provoked the preferential exposure
of one of the two terminal ester groups to the bulk aqueous
medium, while the other remained buried in the hydrophobic
cavity of the receptor. In this case, because of the low solubility
of the diester 104 in water, the acid hydrolysis of the ester
function occurred at the water/cavitand interface. Thus, the
exposed ester group of 104 produced the monoester monoacid
product 105. The increase in solubility of the diester 104
produced by complex formation accelerated the rate of the
hydrolysis in comparison to the same reaction in the absence
of the cavitand 1014+. In contrast, the rate of the hydrolysis
reaction of the terminal ester group of monofunctionalized 105
was reduced because the bound guest adopted a biased J-
conformation. The bound monofunctionalized product 105
showed the terminal ester group buried in the receptor’s cavity,
where the reaction did not take place and the polar carboxylic
acid exposed to the bulk aqueous solution. In other words, the
ester group of 105 spent more time buried in the cavity of the
receptor, which explained the decrease in the rate of the
hydrolysis of 105 to give the diacid product. Under basic
conditions, the monoester monoacid product 105 was
produced in more than 90% yield because the [105-
H]−⊂1014+ inclusion complex precipitated from the solution.
Other applications of water-soluble resorcin[4]arene deep
cavitands were recently reported by Blackmond, Yu, Rebek,
and co-workers.250,254−256

HYDROPHOBIC CAVITY

cavity expands its binding selectivity beyond the size and shape
complementary criteria. Moreover, the endo-functionalized
receptor’s cavity becomes suitable for the inclusion of polar
substrates. The complexes of polar hosts with polar guests
establish complementary polar interactions compensating, to
some extent, the energy required for the dehydration of the

functional groups before binding.84 In this section, we discuss
the properties of receptors possessing functionalized cavities,
which were designed for the selective and eﬃcient binding of
small polar guests in water solution.
5.1. Temple Receptors
A general approach used to rationally design polar hydro-
phobic cavities has been the use of two aromatic panels and a
number of conformationally rigid and polar spacer groups.257
As shown in Figure 49, the resulting arrangement resembles a
classical “temple”, featuring hydrophobic “roof” and “ﬂoor” and
polar functionalities as “pillars” that avoid the hydrophobic
collapse of the cavity.56 “Pillars” have also been functionalized
with ionizable and charged groups to impart water solubility to
the ﬁnal construct.
The polar/functionalized hydrophobic cavity of the “temple”
receptors can accommodate polar guests, such as carbohy-
drates.258 In nature, lectins are protein receptors that recognize
carbohydrates in aqueous solution. Lectins display a
preorganized aromatic cleft or cavity in which polar groups
converge.56 Therefore, carbohydrate recognition is driven by
the HE (section 2.1) and the establishment of hydrogen-
bonding and CH−π interactions (section 2). The stability
constant values for monosaccharide⊂lectin complexes are in
the range of 103−104 M−1. Carbohydrate families and even
more monosaccharides are structurally very similar. This fact
implies that in order to achieve high levels of aﬃnity and
binding selectivity in their recognition process, multiple
hydrogen bonds and CH−π contacts53 must be present in
the formed complexes.258,259
All-equatorial mono- and disaccharides are ideal guests for
the synthetic “temple” receptors, aka synthetic lectins.56,258 All-
equatorial saccharide derivatives feature the larger number of
axial CH groups, which are suitable to interact with the
aromatic panels at the “roof” and “ﬂoor” of the receptor. In
turn, the equatorially oriented OH functions can establish
hydrogen-bonding interactions with the polar groups from the
“pillars” inwardly directed to the cavity. The group of Davis
designed eﬃcient “temple” receptors for the recognition of
carbohydrates in water.260 Diﬀerent aromatic scaﬀolds (e.g.,
biphenyl, tert-phenyl, pyrene, etc.) were used for the
construction of the “roof” and “ﬂoor” of the “temple”
structures. The used “pillars” usually contained isophthalamide
units. The amide groups provided polar functions for the
establishment of hydrogen-bonding interactions with the
included guest. It is worth mentioning here that there are
receptor’s conformations locating most of the amide NH
protons of the “pillars” inwardly oriented with respect to the
cavity of the “temple” receptor.
One of the earliest versions of the water-soluble “temple”
receptors reported by Davis et al. was based on biphenyl units.
The biphenyl structure was slightly twisted owing to the steric
clashes arising from the opposite ortho-protons of the
connected aromatic units in a planar conformation. Never-
theless, the biphenyl unit was a good aromatic platform to
establish CH−π interactions with the axially oriented CHs of
the bound saccharides. For example, the tricyclic receptor 106
contained two biphenyl units (“ﬂoor” and “roof”) linked
together by four isophthalamide groups (“pillars”)261 (Figure
50). The polar “pillars” could oﬀer a total of eight hydrogen
bond donors directed toward the aromatic binding site. The
phenyl components of the “pillars” were equipped with small
dendrons terminated with carboxylate groups to ensure
receptor’s water solubility. In general, the “temple” receptors
formed 1:1 inclusion complexes with mono- and disaccharides
in water solution.260 For example, freshly dissolved D-glucose
107 (Figure 51) in water exists as a mixture of α- and β-
anomers in a 72:28 ratio. The apparent binding constant value
determined for the 107⊂10612−complex was 4.6 M−1
(weighted average of Ka values for putative α-107⊂10612−
and β-107⊂10612−complexes). The apparent binding constant
value increased up to 9.2 M−1 when equilibrated D-glucose
(40:60 α/β ratio) was used as guest261 (Table 9). This result
suggested that “temple” receptor 10612−displayed selectivity
for the binding of the β-anomer of D-glucose 107. Interestingly,
2D NMR experiments revealed that, in solution, the β-D-
glucose isomer, β-107, was included almost exclusively in the
cavity of 10612−. Thus, the minimum value for the binding
constant of the β-107⊂10612−complex was estimated as 9.2
M−1. Glycosides do not undergo mutarotation in water
solution. The pure methyl β-D-glucoside 108 (Figure 51)
formed a 1:1 inclusion complex with “temple” receptor 10612−,
for which a binding constant value of Ka = 27.3 M−1 was
calculated. Receptor 10612−also bound disaccharides in water,
such as D-cellobiose 109 (Figure 51). However, the interaction
between the “temple” receptor 10612−and D-cellobiose 109
was weaker (Kapp = 16.6 M−1) than with the methyl β-D-
glucoside 108.261
The biphenyl “temple” receptor 10612−displayed good
binding selectivity toward certain monosaccharides, despite the
low magnitude of their binding constants. The apparent
binding constant value for the complex of the equilibrated D-
glucose, 107⊂10612−, was 5-fold larger than that of the D-
galactose counterpart (32:68 α/β ratio), 110⊂10612−261
(Table 9). This binding diﬀerence is notable if one considers
that the two monosaccharides, 107 and 110, are epimers only
at C4-position (Figure 51).
To improve the binding aﬃnity of “temple” receptor 106,
alkoxy substituents were incorporated at para-positions of the
biphenyl units.262 This structural modiﬁcation was expected to
produce an increase in the hydrophobicity of the receptor’s
cavity and reduce the access of bulk water molecules for the
solvation of the amide groups. The obtained results
demonstrated a moderate increase in the thermodynamic
stabilities of the all-equatorial monosaccharides complexes (i.e.,
2−4 times). In addition, the incorporation of the para-
substituents in the biphenyl scaﬀold also aﬀected the electron
density of its π-systems and, thereby, the strength of the CH−π
interactions (see section 2) established with the bound
carbohydrates. The use of biphenyl scaﬀolds functionalized

with OH and F groups produced a small increase in the
binding constant values.263 The contribution of the CH−π
interactions to the overall thermodynamic stability of the
complex was likely masked by other factors such as changes in
the hydrophobicity of the cavity and the receptor’s
conformation. Additionally, the structure of the “pillar”
components of the receptor were also modiﬁed. For example,
two of the isophthalamide linkers in the “pillars” of 106 were
replaced by bis-aminomethyl pyrrole units in the structure of
the “temple” receptor.264 This structural modiﬁcation did not
induce signiﬁcant changes in binding aﬃnity but slightly
improved selectivity.
N-Acetyl-monosaccharides interacted with tricyclic receptor
10612−featuring binding constant values larger than that of the
parent compounds.265 The β-anomer of N-acetyl D-glucos-
amine 111 (α/β ratio = 64:36 in water, Figure 51) was
exclusively bound by receptor 10612−featuring an apparent
binding constant value of Kapp = 56 M−1. The anomers of the
methyl-glycoside derivative of N-acetyl D-glucosamine 111,
112 α-anomer and 113 β-anomer (Figure 51), displayed
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent aﬃnities for the “temple” receptor
10612−. The determined binding constant for the
112⊂10612−complex was 24 M−1, whereas the value increased
to 6.3 × 102 M−1 for the complex formation with the β-
anomeric guest, 113⊂10612−. Receptor 10612−showed a
binding aﬃnity for methyl β-N-acetyl D-glucosamine 113 that
was 23-fold larger than for the methyl β-D-glucoside 108
(Table 9). Moreover, the aﬃnity of receptor 10612−for methyl
β-N-acetyl D-glucosamine 113 was similar to that of the natural
wheat germ agglutinin. Even more interesting, receptor 10612−
featured an anomer binding selectivity for the methyl β-N-
acetyl D-glucosamine 113 higher than that of the natural lectin.
The binding geometry of the 113⊂10612−complex was
investigated using 2D NMR spectroscopy experiments and
molecular modeling studies265 (Figure 52). The energy
minimized structure (MM3) of the 113⊂10612−complex
showed the β-N-acetyl D-glycoside, 113, fully included in the
polar hydrophobic cavity of the “temple” receptor 10612−. The
N-acetylamino group protruded partially outside of the cavity
throughout one of its portals. The amide NH of the guest was
involved in NH−π interactions with the biphenyl units of the
receptor.258 The hydroxymethyl group of included 113 was
located in the portal of the cavity, which was opposite to the
one threaded by the N-acetylamino substituent. The molecular

modeling structure of the 113⊂10612−complex conﬁrmed that
all polar substituents of the monosaccharide were equatorially
oriented in order to minimize steric clashes with the aromatic
panels of the receptor and, at the time, maximize host−guest
interactions. The preferred equatorial orientation of all
substituents served to explain the lower binding aﬃnities
displayed by receptor 10612−on binding the α-N-acetyl D-
glycoside, 112, as well as the α-anomeric isomers of other
monosaccharides.
The binding performance of the Davis’s “temple” receptors
was improved by replacing the biphenyl units in 106 with
pyrene derivatives in 114266 (Figure 50). The pyrene scaﬀold
was completely planar and oﬀered a larger aromatic surface
area. Therefore, the HE and the nonpolar contacts with the
axial CHs of bound carbohydrates were expected to be
enhanced. For example, the β-N-acetyl D-glycoside 113 and the
pyrene-based receptor 11436−formed a thermodynamically
and kinetically stable 1:1 inclusion complex in water featuring a
binding constant value of Ka = 1.8 × 104 M−1. This value
represented almost a 30-fold increase on binding aﬃnity with
respect to the 113⊂10612−complex (Table 9). In contrast, the
binding selectivity for the two anomers Ka(113⊂receptor)/
Ka(112⊂receptor) dropped from a value ratio of 23 for
receptor 10612−to 11 for the pyrene-based counterpart 11436−.
Davis et al. showed that larger “temple” receptors eﬃciently
bound disaccharides in water solution.267,268 The authors
synthesized the tetra-cyclic receptor 115 bearing tert-phenyl
units at the “roof” and “ﬂoor” of its “temple” structure and ﬁve
isophthalamide derivatives as “pillars”267 (Figure 50). The
“pillar” units were equipped with carboxylate-terminated
dendrons. An overall 15 negative charge ensured the solubility
of “temple” 11515−in water. “Temple” receptor 11515−

stability constant of Kapp = 6.0 × 102 M−1. The detailed
analyses of a series of 2D NMR spectra acquired for the
109⊂11515−complex indicated that the glycosidic bond of the
bound disaccharide adopted a cis-conformation. In this
conformation, the bound guest ﬁt nicely in the polar

The results of ITC experiments indicated that the binding
process leading to the 109⊂11515−complex was enthalpically
driven (ΔH = −13.4 kJ·mol−1) and accompanied by a small
favorable entropy (TΔS = +2.6 kJ·mol−1).267 The favorable
enthalpic gain on complex formation was assigned to the
hydrogen-bonding and CH−π interactions that were estab-
lished between the host and the guest upon complex
formation.56,259
The eﬀect of “salting-in” anions, such as thiocyanate
(−SCN), on carbohydrate binding was investigated using the
synthetic “temple” receptors 106 and 115.269 In the presence
of 0.3 M KSCN, the association constant values for the
saccharide complexes experienced a decrease of more than 3-
fold. Most likely, the “salting-in” anion competed with the
carbohydrate guests for the binding of the nonpolar regions of
the cavity85 and, possibly, with the inwardly directed hydrogen
bond donors of the “temple” receptor.
The sensing of D-glucose in biological media is a challenging
task because it requires the use of synthetic water-soluble
receptors displaying high binding aﬃnity and selectivity for a
highly polar and hydrophilic guest (see binding of other polar
guests in sections 5.2 and 5.3). In recent years, the group of
Davis has developed “temple” receptors for the selective
binding of
D-glucose in water. For example, the “temple”
receptor 116 was based on two anthracene panels and two
isophthalamide spacer as “pillars”270 (Figure 50). The bis-
anthracenyl receptor 1166−complexed D-glucose 107 featuring
an apparent binding constant value of Kapp = 56 M−1 in water.
A similar value was determined in 0.1 M phosphate buﬀer at
pH = 7.1. The methyl β-D-glucoside, 108, and the “temple”
receptor, 1166−, formed a 1:1 inclusion complex featuring a
stability constant of Ka = 96 M−1 in water (Figure 54). The
magnitude of these binding constants was adequate for the
sensing of D-glucose at the concentration present in human
blood. Receptor 1166−displayed signiﬁcantly lower binding
aﬃnities toward other monosaccharides, Ka and Kapp < 1 M−1.
More recently, Davis et al. reported a highly eﬃcient
receptor, 117 (Figure 50), with improved aﬃnity for the
binding of D-glucose, 107, in water.271 The “temple” receptor
117 was based on two tri-1,3,5-ethylmesitylene units linked
together by three ortho-urea-substituted phenyl linkers. The six
urea groups of receptor 117 oﬀered a total of 12 hydrogen
bond donor NH groups inwardly oriented toward the three-
dimensional cavity of the receptor. The glucose complex,
107⊂11727−, featured a remarkable apparent binding constant
value of Kapp = 1.8 × 104 M−1 in 10−2 M phosphate buﬀer at
pH = 7.4 (Figure 55). Other monosaccharides exhibited
binding constant values that were at least 1 order of magnitude
lower than that of the 107⊂11727−complex. Additionally,
nonsaccharide guests, such as uric acid, adenosine, or
paracetamol, were not included in the cavity of 11727−.
These results demonstrated that synthetic receptors relying on
hydrogen-bonding and CH−π interactions can feature high
binding aﬃnity and selectivity for D-glucose recognition and
sensing in water solution.
“Temple” receptors, which structurally resemble the ones
discussed above, were used to complex polysaccharides.272
Polysaccharides, such as cellulose, display low solubility in
water. The “temple” receptors were bound to diﬀerent regions
of the polysaccharide structure. The resulting supramolecular
polymer featured a polyrotaxane topology and improved the
water solubility of the bound polysaccharide.
5.2. Naphthotubes
Glass et al.,273 as well as Jiang et al.,274 used endo-functionalized
molecular tubes (aka naphthotubes) based on two bis-
naphthalene cleft-like units linked together by two amide
bonds, as receptors of polar guests in water solution.275 The
synthesis of these receptors yielded a mixture of two isomers:
syn and anti (Figure 56). The syn-isomer displayed the two bis-

naphthalene units with identical orientation. On the contrary,
the anti-isomer featured the naphthalene clefts linked in
opposite directions.
The structure of the syn-isomer, syn-118, was rather
conformationally rigid and presented a deep aromatic cavity
(Figure 56a,c). However, the anti-isomer, anti-119, was
structurally more ﬂexible, displaying a shallow aromatic cavity
(Figure 56b,d). The cavities of both isomers were open at two
opposite ends. In addition, the molecular tubes, syn- 118 and
anti-119, contained two amide linkages, with the NHs inwardly
directed with respect to the aromatic cavities. Finally, the
structures of the synthesized naphthotubes also had peripheral
carboxylate groups, which promoted water solubility.275
The molecular tube syn-118 showed a deep hydrophobic
cavity with an open polar end deﬁned by the two inwardly
directed amide NHs (Figure 56a,c). Therefore, the NH amide
groups of syn-118 were partially shielded from the bulk
aqueous solution, but the cavity of the naphthotube was likely
solvated by water molecules. Jiang et al. pointed out that the
release of bound water molecules from the cavity of the
molecular tube syn- 118 to the bulk solution was the main
force to drive the inclusion of complementary polar guests.274
The synthesis of the water-soluble naphthotubes syn-118
and anti-119 was originally reported by Glass et al. in 2004.273
The authors used the endo-functionalized tubes to investigate
the binding of long-chain carboxylic acids, i.e., fatty acids. The
binding experiments were conducted in 2 × 10−2 M HEPES
buﬀer at pH = 8.4. The obtained results showed that the tetra-
carboxylate receptors syn-1184−and anti-1194−were able to
bind the hydrocarbon chain of the fatty acids mainly through
the HE (see section 2.1). The ionized carboxylic acid of the
bound guest remained exposed to the bulk aqueous solution.
Both isomers featured similar binding constant values for an
identical fatty acid. The magnitude of the binding constants
increased with the length of the fatty acid alkyl chain. The
largest binding constant value was determined for dodecanoic
acid 120 (Figure 57), Ka ([120-H]−⊂syn-1184−and [120-
H]−⊂anti-1194−) ∼2 × 104 M−1 (Figure 58 and Table 10).
Note that 120 was deprotonated in basic aqueous buﬀer
solution leading to dodecanoate [120-H]−. A priori, the polar
hydrophobic cavity of receptor syn-1184−was suitable for the
inclusion of the terminal carboxylate group of the dodecanoate
[120-H]−. The bound carboxylate was expected to be involved
in charge−dipole and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the
amide NHs (see section 2). However, this binding geometry
was not detected in water solution using NMR spectroscopy
techniques. Most likely, the high energetic cost required for the
desolvation of the carboxylate group in the case of the latter
binding geometry was responsible for this result.
A few years later, Jiang et al. applied the same endo-
functionalized molecular tubes, syn-118 and anti-119, for the
recognition of neutral polar guests in water solution.275,276 The
polar hydrophobic cavity of these receptors was appropriate for
binding small molecules having a nonpolar section and one or
two hydrogen bond acceptor groups. The HE and the
establishment of hydrogen-bonding interactions worked
synergistically to drive the inclusion of the neutral polar
molecules in the cavity of the endo-functionalized receptors.
For example, anti-1194−, produced a 1:1 inclusion complex
with dimethylformamide 121 (Figure 57) having a binding
constant value of Ka (121⊂anti-1194−) = 3.1 × 102 M−1 in
water.274 The complex between tetrahydrofuran and anti-
1194−was characterized with a similar binding constant value
(Table 10). Note that these two guests, dimethylformamide
and tetrahydrofuran, feature just one hydrogen-bonding
acceptor group. Surprisingly, syn-1184−was less eﬃcient in

the binding of the same polar guests.274 Thus, the binding
aﬃnity constants for the complexes of syn- 1184−were on the
order of 102 M−1 or even lower (Table 10). The authors
suggested that the polar hydrophobic cavity of syn-1184−was
better solvated by water molecules than that of anti-1194−.276
Thus, the release of the bound water molecules from the cavity
of syn-1184−to the bulk solution upon guest binding was
energetically costlier than that from anti-1194−.
Pyrazine 122 and 1,4-dioxane 123 (Figure 57) possess two
heteroatoms that were hydrogen-bonding complementary to
the polar NHs deﬁning the polar hydrophobic aromatic cavity
of the molecular tubes. In addition, the two latter polar guests
were size and shape complementary to the receptor’s cavity.
The binding constant values of the 1:1 inclusion complexes
formed between syn-1184−and anti-1194−receptors and the
pyrazine 122 were on the order of Ka ∼2 × 103 M−1 (Table
10).277 In contrast, 1,4-dioxane 123 established 1:1 inclusion
complexes with the anti-1194−and syn-1184−receptors
featuring binding constant values that diﬀered by almost 1
order of magnitude, Ka (123⊂anti-1194−) = 1.4 × 104 M−1 and
Ka(123⊂syn-1184−) = 3.2 × 103 M−1 (Figure 59).274 As
mentioned above, the diﬀerence in binding aﬃnities could be
related to the diﬀerent solvation energies of the free receptors
in water solution. The heteroatoms (polar groups) of the
guests, 122 and 123, established two simultaneous hydrogen-
bonding interactions with the two amide NHs of the anti-
1194−and syn-1184−receptors. 1H NMR titration experiments
performed in 9:1 H2O/D2O solution supported the formation
of hydrogen-bonding interactions in the inclusion complexes
(NH signals moved downﬁeld). The nonpolar section of
guests, 122 and 123, was partially shielded from the bulk
solution thanks to the bis-naphthalene clefts of syn-1184−and
anti-1194−. It is worth mentioning here that the anti-receptor
1194−displayed a high binding selectivity for 1,4-dioxane, 123,
over many other investigated polar guests (vide infra).
ITC experiments revealed that the complexation process of
1,4-dioxane, 123, with anti-1194−, was mainly enthalpically
driven, ΔH = −17.3 kJ·mol−1 and reinforced by the entropic
term, TΔS = +5.6 kJ·mol−1.274 Taken together, the results
derived from the characterization of the 123⊂anti-1194−
complex were used to invoke the “nonclassical” hydrophobic
eﬀect in the binding process (see HE in section 2.1) and the
existence of polar interactions (hydrogen bonds) in water. The
binding enthalpy of the 123⊂syn-1184−complex was similar to
that of the 123⊂anti-1194−complex, but the entropy of
binding was less favorable for the former (TΔS = +2.6 kJ·
mol−1).
More recently, Jiang et al. investigated the driving forces and
molecular properties involved in the binding of polar guests by
the endo-functionalized molecular tubes.277 By performing a
principal component analysis of the determined binding
aﬃnities (i.e., the mathematical correlation between molecular
properties of guests and binding constant values of complexes),
the authors concluded that the increase in the hydrophobicity,
volume, surface area, and polarizability of the guest had a
positive eﬀect on the Ka value. On the other hand, the increase
of the dipole moment of the guest had a detrimental eﬀect on
the Ka value. It is worth mentioning here that these molecular
properties are not the only factors to be considered for eﬃcient
binding. In silico calculations indicated that the binding process
of polar guests with endo-functionalized molecular tubes was
also driven by the HE. In addition, the formation of the
intermolecular hydrogen bonds was key in achieving high
binding selectivity for polar over nonpolar counterparts. On
the basis of all these ﬁndings, it was restated that the guest
must be size, shape, and function complementary to the polar
hydrophobic cavity of the endo-functionalized receptors.
Furthermore, the ideal guest should form two hydrogen
bonds with the amide NHs and ﬁll completely the cavity of the
receptor. The adequate ﬁlling of the receptor’s cavity should
provoke the release of the bound water molecules. With all this
information at hand, Jiang et al. designed guest 124 (Figure
57), which was a perfect ﬁt for the cavity of the syn-receptor

1184−as well as a good complementarity for the binding
pocket of the anti-receptor 1194−(Figure 60). The 124⊂anti-
1194−complex was characterized with a binding constant value
of Ka = 1.4 × 106 M−1,277 which is one of the largest values
reported to date for the complexation of a small polar molecule
by a synthetic host bearing endohedral polar groups in water.
The binding aﬃnity of the 124⊂syn-1184−was calculated as Ka
= 4.6 × 105 M−1. The thermodynamic characterization of the
binding process of the former 1:1 complex, 124⊂anti-1194−,
revealed a highly favorable enthalpy term, ΔH = −45.1 kJ·
mol−1, and an unfavorable entropy component, TΔS = −9.9
kJ·mol−1.
The achiral naphthotubes syn-118 and anti-119 were applied
for the sensing of chiral epoxides.278 Chiral epoxides
transferred their point chirality to the supramolecular
assembly. The circular dichroism spectra of the supramolecular
complexes of receptors syn-1184−and anti-1194−served to
quantify the enantiomeric excess of the products derived from
asymmetric epoxidation reactions.
Receptors syn-118 and anti-119 were also used for the
assembly of poly(pseudorotaxanes).279 These supramolecular
polymers were converted into hydrogels upon metal complex-
ation.
5.3. Calix[4]pyrroles
Calix[4]pyrroles are macrocyclic compounds containing four
pyrrole units linked together by fully substituted sp3-carbon
atoms, known as meso-carbons. Calix[4]pyrroles are conforma-
tionally ﬂexible and adopt diﬀerent conformations in solution
characterized by the relative orientation of their pyrrole units.
On the one hand, in nonpolar solvents, such as dichloro-
methane and chloroform, calix[4]pyrroles adopt an alternate
conformation: 1,2- or 1,3-alternate. On the other hand, in polar
solvents, such as acetone, acetonitrile, and methanol, calix[4]-
pyrroles display a cone or partial-cone conformation. In cone
conformation, calix[4]pyrroles establish four convergent
hydrogen-bonding interactions between the four pyrrole NHs
and a hydrogen bond acceptor group of a solvent molecule or a
bound guest.280
The incorporation of aromatic substituents at the meso-
carbons of calix[4]pyrroles produces aryl-extended derivatives.
Aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles exist as four possible conﬁgura-
tional isomers, ααββ, αβαβ, αααβ, and αααα, depending on
the relative orientation of their meso-aryl substituents. This
conﬁgurational notation was introduced by Sessler et al.281 in
analogy to the atropoisomerism nomenclature used for tetra-
phenyl-substituted porphyrins. In cone conformation, the
tetra-α or αααα-isomer of aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles
features a deep aromatic cavity closed at one end by a polar
binding site and open at the opposite end4,281 (Figure 61b).
In water solution, the conformation adopted by the tetra-α
isomer of aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles remains dynamic. The
tetra-α isomer may adopt alternate and cone conformations,
which rapidly interconvert on the 1H NMR chemical shift time
scale. The tetra-α isomer of aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles
engage in 1:1 inclusion complexes, with neutral guests
possessing electron-rich regions that are suitable hydrogen
bond acceptors. The inclusion of the guest in the polar
aromatic cavity locks the calix[4]pyrrole receptor in the cone
conformation.280 The inclusion of the polar guest in the
receptor’s cavity isolates the hydrogen-bonding groups of the
bound binding partners from solvation with bulk water
molecules. This binding arrangement constitutes a unique
characteristic of the inclusion complexes derived from aryl-

extended calix[4]pyrrole receptors, which is expected to
provide a substantial contribution of hydrogen-bonding
interactions (section 2) to the overall gain in binding free
energy of the complex. The HE (section 2.1) also plays an
important role in the high levels of binding aﬃnity measured
for the complexes of the tetra-α isomer of aryl-extended
calix[4]pyrroles with polar guests in water solution.
Tetra-α aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles equipped with
ionizable or charged groups at either the upper or lower rim
were reported in the literature. In 2009, our research group
introduced two water-soluble aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles.282
The ﬁrst series of water-soluble aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles
were functionalized with carboxylic acids, 125, and amino
groups, 126, at their upper rim (Figure 61a). Both calix[4]-
pyrroles were soluble at millimolar concentrations in water
solution at pH ∼7. Interestingly, tetra-carboxylate calix[4]-
pyrrole [125-4H]4−and tetra-ammonium calix[4]pyrrole
[126+4H]4+ complexed pyridyl N-oxides, 127 and 128 (Figure
62a), in water forming thermodynamically and kinetically
highly stable 1:1 inclusion complexes.282 The binding constant
value of pyridine N-oxide 127 with any of the two hosts was ca.
2 × 104 M−1. The binding aﬃnity decreased 1 order of
magnitude for the para-phenyl pyridyl N-oxide derivative 128
(Table 11).
The fact that similar binding constant values were
determined for pairs of complexes of the same guest with
the two receptors, evidenced that the diﬀerent characteristics
of the water-solubilizing groups did not aﬀect their
thermodynamic stabilities (see also the studies using cavitand
complexes in section 4.2). This result was in agreement with
our expectations, owing to the neutral character of the polar
guests. In the inclusion complexes of the N-oxides, the oxygen
atom of the bound guest established four simultaneous
hydrogen bonds with the four pyrrole NHs of the calix[4]-
pyrrole unit of the receptor. The four aromatic walls of the
receptor were engaged in π−π and CH−π interactions with the
aromatic groups of the bound guests.282
The placement of substituents at the upper rim of aryl-
extended calix[4]pyrroles 125 and 126 could have a
deleterious eﬀect on the thermodynamic stability of their
inclusion complexes owing to the existence of potential steric
clashes with the bound guests. With the aim to evaluate this
hypothesis, the water-solubilizing groups were moved to the
lower rim of structurally related water-soluble aryl-extended
calix[4]pyrroles,283 i.e., 129 (Figure 61a). The terminal
carboxylic acid groups in 129 were located away from the
calix[4]pyrrole’s binding pocket. This change prevented the
interference of the water-solubilizing groups with the binding
process. Nevertheless, the binding constant value of the
127⊂[129-4H]4−complex was very similar to that determined
for the 127⊂[125-4H]4−counterpart (Table 11). This ﬁnding
indicated that the placement of the water-solubilizing groups,
at either the upper or lower rim of the water-soluble aryl-
extended calix[4]pyrrole receptors, had a minimum eﬀect on
the thermodynamic stability of these inclusion complexes.
The results of ITC experiments determined that the binding
process of pyridyl N-oxides with aryl-extended calix[4]pyrrole
receptors, in water solution, was strongly driven by the
enthalpy.283 This thermodynamic signature is characteristic of
the so-called “nonclassical” hydrophobic eﬀect (section 2.1)
and is also expected for supramolecular complexes formed in
water having a well-deﬁned binding geometry. This was clearly
the case for the inclusion complexes at hand, in which
directional polar interactions (section 2), such as hydrogen-
bonding, π−π, and CH−π were also involved. Unfortunately,
dissecting the contributions of polar interactions and the HE to
the overall free energy of binding was far from trivial (vide
infra).
The aryl-extended calix[4]pyrrole receptors discussed above
were functionalized at either their upper or lower rims. In
2017, our group reported a synthetic methodology for the
preparation of tetra-α isomers of aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles
functionalized at both upper and lower rims.284 The method
involved the use of methyltributylammonium chloride as
additive and 4 M HCl in dioxane as Lewis acid. The
ammonium chloride salt was used as a templating agent to
favor the formation of the tetra-α isomer in the reaction
mixture. For example, the tetrol precursor of the calix[4]-
pyrrole cavitands 130a,b285 (Figure 63) was obtained
following the templating agent synthetic methodology.
Calix[4]pyrroles functionalized only at the lower rim were
also accessible using this methodology, i.e., 131285 (Figure
61a).
Tetra-pyridinium receptors 130a,b4+ and 1314+ displayed
good binding aﬃnities, Ka > 104 M−1, toward size
complementary lactams, for example, the six-membered ring
132 (Figure 62b), in water solution.285 The energy minimized
structure (MM3) of the 132⊂130a4+ complex (Figure 64)
showed the oxygen atom of the lactam establishing four
hydrogen bonds with the pyrrole NHs of the calix[4]pyrrole
core in cone conformation. The nonpolar section of the lactam
was buried in the deep cavity of the receptor, where it
established multiple CH−π contacts with the meso-aromatic
walls. The NH of the bound lactam was also engaged in NH−π
interactions.
We assessed the importance of intermolecular hydrogen-
bonding interactions in the complexes of water-soluble aryl-
extended calix[4]pyrroles using a series of cyclic polar
guests:285 cyclic ketone 133, lactone 134, lactam 132, and
cyclic urea 135 (Figure 62b). The selected guests have
diﬀerent levels of polarity (basicity of the carbonyl’s oxygen
atom) and hydrophobicity. The hydrophobicity decreases from

the cyclic ketone 133 (more hydrophobic) to the cyclic urea
135 (less hydrophobic), as reported by the calculated log P
values (partition coeﬃcient between octanol and water). In
water, the binding constant values of supramolecular inclusion
complexes were expected to increase in response to the
increase of the hydrophobicity of the guests, i.e., Ka
(133⊂receptor) > Ka (135⊂receptor). Surprisingly for us,
aryl-extended calix[4]pyrrole receptor 130b4+ displayed the
opposite trend in binding aﬃnities. That is, the water-soluble
aryl-extended calix[4]pyrrole bound the less hydrophobic
guest, 135, more strongly than the more hydrophobic
counterpart, 133. Clearly, guest hydrophobicity did not
correlate with binding aﬃnity. In contrast, the increase in
polarity (basicity) and hydrogen bond acceptor properties of
the guests seemed to produce larger binding aﬃnities. Indeed,
we observed the existence of a linear relationship between the
calculated binding free energies for the inclusion complexes of
the cyclic guest’s series and the hydrogen-bonding acceptor
parameter (β) for their carbonyl’s oxygen atom. For example,
the 1:1 inclusion complex of the cyclic ketone 133 (less polar
guest in the series) featured a binding constant value Ka
(133⊂130b4+) = 1.4 × 103 M−1. The analogous complex of
the cyclic urea 135 (more polar guest in the series)
experienced an increase of 2 orders of magnitude in binding
constant (Table 11). Taken together, these results supported
that hydrogen-bonding interactions contributed to a signiﬁcant
extent to the free energy of binding of the complexes (ΔG).
The deep aromatic cavity provided by the aryl-extended
calix[4]pyrrole receptors protects the hydrogen-bonded groups
of the binding partners from solvation with bulk water
molecules, most likely, reinforcing its eﬃciency. The binding
of the cyclic polar guests’ series, 132−135, was characterized
by a large enthalpic contribution associated with the
“nonclassical” HE.285
Acyclic monoamides were also suitable guests for inclusion
in the polar cavity of aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles.286 Amides
exist as a mixture of trans- and cis-rotamers in solution287
(Figure 65a). The relative population of trans- and cis-rotamers
depends on the amide’s substituents and the solvent. In
general, the trans-rotamer of secondary formamides and
acetamides is energetically more favorable than the cis-
counterpart. The trans-to-cis interconversion is slow on the
NMR chemical shift time scale but fast on the human time
scale, precluding the isolation of the pure isomers. The water-
soluble aryl-extended calix[4]pyrrole 136 (Figure 61a) was
applied for the recognition of secondary and tertiary N-phenyl
formamides and acetamides in water.286 The deep aromatic
cavity of the aryl-extended receptor in the cone conformation
showed a good size and shape complementarity for the cis-
rotamer (Figure 65b). The inclusion of the trans-rotamer was
expected to energetically destabilize the cone conformation of
the receptor due to steric clashes with the meso-aryl
substituents.
Experimentally, tetra-phenyl tetra-pyridinium receptor 1364+
showed a high binding aﬃnity (Ka > 103 M−1) and
conformational selectivity for the cis-rotamer of N-phenyl
formamides and acetamides.286 For example, although N-
phenyl formamide 137 (Figure 65a) was present as a 68:32
mixture of trans/cis isomers in water, the tetra-phenyl
calix[4]pyrrole 1364+ exclusively bound the cis-rotamer of
137 featuring an estimated association constant value Ka (cis-
137⊂1364+) > 104 M−1. Calix[4]pyrrole 1364+ could be
considered as a minimal chaperone selecting the cis-rotamer of
the formamide and increasing its concentration in the bound
form. Using control experiments, the binding constant value
for the trans-rotamer of N-phenyl formamides and acetamides
was estimated to be lower than 30 M−1.286 The intermolecular
forces involved in the formation of the inclusion complexes of
the acyclic monoamides were analogous to those discussed
above for the lactam guest.
The elaboration of the aromatic cavity of aryl-extended
calix[4]pyrroles with para-ethynyl-aryl substituents aﬀorded
super aryl-extended derivatives.288 The super aryl-extended
calix[4]pyrroles featured a much deeper aromatic cavity than
the aryl-extended counterparts (Figure 63). The larger
aromatic cavity present in super aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles
was expected to enhance the HE for binding. Moreover, it
could also improve the shielding of the intermolecular
hydrogen-bonded groups of the inclusion complexes from
water solvation. In the previous examples of aryl-extended
calix[4]pyrroles, four ionizable or charged groups appended at
either their upper or lower rims warranted water solubility. Not
surprisingly, super aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles bearing only

four water-solubilizing groups at their upper rims were not
soluble in water at the required concentrations for NMR
characterization.288
A signiﬁcant increase in water solubility for super aryl-
extended calix[4]pyrroles was accomplished by appending a
total of eight water-solubilizing groups at the periphery of their
scaﬀolds.289 We located four water-solubilizing groups at the
upper rim and the other four at the lower rim. The synthesized
octa-acid and octa-pyridinium super aryl-extended calix[4]-
pyrroles, 138 and 139 (Figure 63), respectively, structurally
resembled the Gibb’s resorcin[4]arene deep-cavity cavitands
(Section 4.2). However, the water-soluble super aryl-extended
calix[4]pyrroles displayed a functionalized aromatic cavity with
four hydrogen bond donors (NHs) at the closed end. The
octa-acid 138 was soluble in water at millimolar concentrations
at pH ∼10 owing to the ionization of its carboxylic acids as
carboxylates, i.e., [138-8H]8−, whereas the octa-pyridinium
1398+ featured similar water solubility independently of the pH
of the solution.289
The two water-soluble super aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles,
[138-8H]8−and 1398+, were used as model systems for the
quantiﬁcation of the HE in the complexation of a series of
pyridyl N-oxide derivatives in water.289 The pyridyl N-oxides in
the selected series diﬀered in the size of the para-substituent:
methyl, tert-butyl, n-butyl, and phenyl. Receptors [138-8H]8−
and 1398+ formed 1:1 inclusion complexes with all the pyridyl
N-oxides. Not surprisingly and as already mentioned above for
other calix[4]pyrrole receptors, the pair of complexes for a
given N-oxide featured similar binding constant values. The
binding constant values determined for all complexes were
larger than 105 M−1.
It is worth noting here that the determined binding constant
values for the complexes of pyridine N-oxide, 127, with the
two super aryl-extended calix[4]pyrrole receptors, were 1 order
of magnitude larger than that of 127⊂[125-4H]4−complex
(125 is a water-soluble aryl-extended calix[4]pyrrole receptor)
(Table 11). The increase in binding aﬃnity was assigned to the
enhanced hydrophobic character of the aromatic cavity in the
super aryl-extended receptors. In the series of pyridyl N-oxides,
the increase in the surface area of the pyridyl’s para-substituent
was translated into an increase in the binding free energy.289
Most likely, the observed intensiﬁcation in binding aﬃnity was
derived from the reduction of the water accessible surface area
in the complex and the concomitant increase in the number of
nonpolar contacts (mainly van der Waals interactions for the
para-alkyl chain substituents). Therefore, the gain in free
energy could be related to the HE. The determined free
energies of binding showed a linear relationship with respect to
the surface area of the para-alkyl substituents of the N-oxide
guest series. The slope of the line deﬁned by the data returned
a value of 138−159 J·mol−1·Å−2.289 The calculated value was
assigned to the HE operating in these model systems. The
above determined magnitude was in agreement with other
values assigned to the HE,3 which were derived from site-
directed mutagenesis of protein residues and the transfer of
solutes from nonpolar solvents to water.
Interestingly, the inclusion complex of 4-phenylpyridine N-
oxide 128 with any of the two super aryl-extended calix[4]-
pyrrole hosts, [138-8H]8−or 1398+, featured an additional
value of 8.4 kJ·mol−1 with respect to our estimate based on the
reduction of solvent accessible surface area.289 Most likely, this
extra energy derived from the formation of a cluster of
aromatic interactions in the upper section of the cavity of the
super aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles (Figure 66). Super aryl-
extended calix[4]pyrroles, [138-8H]8−and 1398+, displayed
nanomolar dissociation constants for 128 (Table 11),
demonstrating that, in water, thermodynamically highly stable
complexes can be formed between small polar neutral
molecules and synthetic receptors having large functionalized
aromatic cavities.
Other applications of water-soluble aryl-extended calix[4]-
pyrroles were reported in literature. For example, Sessler et al.
showed that, in aqueous solution, the tetra-acid 125 self-
assembled into high-order aggregates in the presence of a
ditopic bis-N-oxide.290 The morphology of the corresponding
supramolecular assembly could be controlled by changing the
pH of the solution.
6. SELF-ASSEMBLED WATER-SOLUBLE RECEPTORS
Self-assembly is a supramolecular approach, based on the use
of reversible noncovalent interactions,44 to hold together
multiple copies of molecular components (i.e., building blocks)
and produce large, well-deﬁned, and functional architectures1
under thermodynamic control.15 The information for the
assembly process is encoded in the binding motifs and
molecular structures (shape) of the building blocks.291 Water-
soluble self-assembled receptors were prepared using metal−
ligand coordination bonds,16 and noncovalent electrostatic
forces (section 2), like Coulombic232 and hydrogen-bonding
interactions, and the assistance of the HE.14
In this section, we classify self-assembled molecular
containers/receptors in two diﬀerent categories: cages and
capsules. We deﬁne cages as self-assembled receptors that
feature large portals allowing the reversible passage of guests.
They are typically assembled by the combination of ﬂat, rigid
multitopic ligands with coordination metal ions (i.e., metal
coordination cages). On the other hand, capsules feature an
enclosed cavity in which the in/out exchange of the guest
requires the partial or total dissociation of the capsular
assembly. Capsules are assembled from concave building
blocks, such as calix[4]arenes and resorcin[4]arenes (see
section 4).
6.1. Metal Coordination Cages
The formation of coordination bonds between metal ions and
bespoken multitopic ligands might lead to metal coordination
cages. Metal−ligand coordination bonds are thermodynami-
cally highly stable in both nonpolar and polar solvents15 unless
a competitive coordinating solvent is used. In general, the

metallo-cages are soluble in water owing to the use of multiple
metal ions for their assembly.291 In addition, polar, ionizable,
and charged groups can be incorporated in the structures of
the ligands to improve the water solubility of the self-
assembled metallo-cages and circumvent their aggregation
tendency.16
Most of the examples of metal coordination cages featured a
hydrophobic cavity, which could accommodate size and shape
complementary neutral or charged guests.16,31 The overall
charge of the metallo-assembly imposed charge binding
selectivity and also aﬀects the stability and reactivity of the
bound guests.18 The main intermolecular interactions for guest
binding in self-assembled metallo-cages are the HE and the
establishment of host−guest Coulombic interactions (section
2).
Water-soluble octahedral M6L4 cages were designed by
Fujita et al. in the 1990s.292 The designed cages were based on
Pd(II) and Pt(II) metal ions in combination with neutral tris-
pyridyl ligands (Figure 67). The Pd(II)-cages293 140a,b and
the analogous Pt(II)-cages294 140c,d were positively charged
(z = +12). The charged metal ions at the vertices of the
octahedron imparted water solubility.15 The cavity volume of
the octahedral cages 140a−d was ca. 650 Å3.
In the solid state, an octahedral Pd(II)-cage similar to 140a
(ethylenediamine ligands changed by 2,2′-bipyridine ligands)
showed 10 water molecules included in its hydrophobic
cavity.295 The bound water molecules displayed an ice-like
structure, which was stabilized by water−water hydrogen-
bonding interactions and by H2O−π or OH−π interactions
with the aromatic panels of the octahedral cage (see also the
inclusion of water in the cavity of calix[4]arenes in section
4.1). Therefore, the formation of the inclusion complexes
deriving from the octahedral Pd(II)/Pt(II)-cages was assumed
to be mainly driven by the entropy. This entropic gain was
assigned to the “melting” of the cluster of water molecules
included in the cage’s cavity.295
The binding properties of the dodeca-cationic Pd(II)-cages,
140a,b12+, and the Pt(II)-counterparts, 140c,d12+, were very
similar. Neutral guests were included in the hydrophobic
cavities of the metallo-cages mainly through the HE.291 For
example, four molecules of 1-adamantanol 141 (Figure 68)
were included in the cavity of 140a12+ forming the
1414⊂140a12+ cage complex.296 Interestingly, the inclusion of
the four molecules of 1-adamantanol 141 was characterized by
a large positive cooperativity. The proton signals of bound 141,
in the 1414⊂140a12+ cage complex, appeared upﬁeld-shifted in
its
1H NMR spectrum (Figure 68), indicating that the
adamantane group was buried in the cage’s cavity (Figure
69). Consequently, the hydroxyl group of the guest remained
exposed to the bulk aqueous solution.
The octahedral Pd(II)-cages 140a,b and the analogous
Pt(II)-cages 140c,d were also applied to mediate chemical
transformations in water solution.18,297 For example, the
Pd(II)-cage 140b promoted the Diels−Alder reaction of

anthracenes and phthalimides in water solution.298 In the
presence of cage 140b, the Diels−Alder reaction between 9-
hydroxymethylanthracene, 142, and N-cyclohexylphthalimide,
143, gave the syn-isomer, 144, in almost quantitative yield
(Scheme 5). This unusual regioselectivity was achieved when
using the octahedral metallo-cage as nanoreactor. The two
reactants, 142 and 143, were included in the cavity of the
Pd(II)-cage 140b12+, leading to the exclusive formation of the
heteroternary [142·143]⊂140b12+ cage complex. Most likely,
this was the best combination of the potential guests to
adequately ﬁll the cavity’s volume. The double bond of the
bound dienophile, 143, was placed in close proximity to the
1,4-position of the anthracene, 142, acting as diene. Therefore,
the reaction provided the unusual 1,4-Diels−Alder product
144 (Scheme 5). The reaction required the use of
stoichiometric amounts of the Pd(II)-cage 140b.
The metallo-cage 140a was used to catalyze the
Knoevenagel condensation of aromatic aldehydes with Mel-
drum’s acid in neutral water.299 Once the aromatic aldehyde
was included in the Pd(II)-cage 140a12+, the cationic
environment stabilized the negatively charged reaction
intermediate. The reaction product was too large to be fully
encapsulated allowing the catalytic turnover of the Pd(II)-cage
140a12+.
The Pt(II)-cage 145, M6L2L3′ (Figure 67), based on two
diﬀerent ligands, featured a trigonal prism structure. The
Pt(II)-cage 145 was used to provide a nonpolar environment
for the eﬃcient formation of hydrogen-bonded base pairs in
water300 (see section 5 for receptors able to bind polar
molecules). Separate solutions of AMP2−and UMP2−formed

formation in water solution of the heteroternary [AMP2−·

complexes of the nucleotides were stabilized through the HE,

stabilized by the establishment of two water-shielded hydrogen

bonds between the bases of the two bound nucleotides.
Therefore, the hydrophobic cavity of the cage allowed the
hydrogen-bonding base-pairing of the two nucleotides in water
solution through an anti-Hoogsteen binding geometry.
In 2001, Raymond et al. introduced tetrahedral M4L6
cages,301 e.g., 146 (Figure 67), based on trivalent or tetra-
valent metal ions, Ga(III), Al(III), Fe(III), Si(IV), or Ti(IV),
and a bis-catechol-substituted naphthalene ligand. The
structures of the M4L6 cages assembled with the above-
mentioned components were almost identical. We center our
discussion on the properties and applications of the Ga(III)-
cage, 146, and refer to other tetrahedral cages, having diﬀerent
metal centers, for comparison. The bis-catechol naphthalene
ligand was conformationally relatively rigid owing to the
formation of intramolecular NH···O hydrogen bonds.301
Interestingly, the conﬁguration of a vertex of 146 was
mechanically coupled to that of the others owing to the ligand
rigidity. This led to the obtention of the Ga(III)-cage 146 as a
racemic mixture of two homochiral assemblies, ΔΔΔΔ and
ΛΛΛΛ, both displaying T symmetry.301,302
The Ga(III)-cage 146 had 12 negative charges (z = −12)
imparting water solubility.301 The binding pocket of dodeca-
anionic 14612−, which was surrounded by six naphthalene
panels, was hydrophobic. Therefore, neutral and cationic
guests were eﬃciently bound in the cavity of 14612−15,303
through the HE, Coulombic, cation−π and CH−π interactions
(see section 2). Furthermore, the cavity size of 14612−
experienced subtle expansions/contractions in order to
accommodate to the guests’ size (induced ﬁt). The maximum
volume displayed by the Ga(III)-cage 14612−was ca. 440
Å3.304
The formation of the cage complexes17,291 between cationic
guests and the Ga(III)-cage 14612−was driven by entro-
py.305,306 This thermodynamic signature mainly derived from
the desolvation of the cage’s cavity (included water molecules
could be stabilized by OH−π interactions) and the charged
guest prior to complexation. Cationic guests did also bind to
the exterior of the cage through cation−π and Coulombic
interactions. The exo-binding process of the guests was
characterized to be driven by enthalpy.305,306
For example, the binding constant value of the 1:1 cage
complex between tetra-ethylammonium, 147+ (Figure 68), and
the Ga(III)-cage 14612−was determined to be Ka
(147+⊂14612−) = 3.5 × 104 M−1 in water containing 0.1 M
KCl.305 The binding process was driven by entropy, TΔS =
+20.9 kJ·mol−1, and favored by enthalpy, ΔH = −4.1 kJ·mol−1.
The included tetra-ethylammonium guest 147+ was involved in
a slow chemical exchange process on the 1H NMR chemical
shift time scale with the free counterpart.307 The guest in/out
exchange process involved a slippage mechanism, i.e.,
deformation of a cage’s portal, operating for the entrance/
exchange of the guest in the cage complex. On the other hand,
the constant value for the binding of the same cationic guest,
147+, to the exterior of the already complexed tetrahedral cage
was Ka (147+⊂14612−⇌147+[147+⊂14612−]) = 63 M−1. The
exo-cage binding process displayed fast exchange dynamics
between free and bound 147+ on the chemical shift time
scale305 (Figure 71). In the latter case, the exo-binding process
was characterized by ΔH = −27.6 kJ·mol−1 and TΔS = −16.7
kJ·mol−1.
In the same vein, protonated secondary and tertiary amines
were also included in the cavity of the tetrahedral Ga(III)-cage
14612−.308 The formed cage complexes were stabilized by
Coulombic and cation−π interactions (section 2). Bergman,
Raymond, and co-workers demonstrated that the bound
protonated amines experienced an increase of 2.1−4.5 pKa
units in basicity.308 Likewise, bound protonated phosphines
also displayed an increase in basicity.308 Additionally, proton-
bound amine homodimers were stabilized in the hydrophobic
cavity of the Ga(III)-cage 14612−.309
The stabilization of cationic species in water using the
Ga(III)-cage 14612−was applied to the isolation of iminium
cations,310 such as 148+ (Scheme 6a), which are prone to fast
hydrolysis in neutral or basic solution. The iminium cation
148+ was generated in situ from the reaction of 2-pentanone
with pyrrolidine. Once formed, it was rapidly included and
stabilized in the cavity of the Ga(III)-cage 14612−in water at
basic pD (Scheme 6a).
Besides cationic species, the hydrophobic character of the
cavity of Ga(III)-cage 14612−allowed the inclusion of neutral
nonpolar species mainly through the HE.311 The binding
properties of the Ga(III)-cage 14612−and analogues
tetrahedral cages were also exploited in the energetic
stabilization of transition states and high-energy conformers
by Bergman, Raymond, Toste, and co-workers.18,303,312 Both
stabilization mechanisms might produce rate accelerations for
particular processes.
For example, in water solution, the Ga(III)-cage 14612−
increased the rate of rotation of the C(O)−N bond for the
included, symmetric tertiary amides.313 The planar ground
state of the amide group was destabilized in the interior of the
cage 14612−. The included amide was forced to adopt a twisted
conformation. The binding of a high-energy conformer of the
amide provoked a decrease of up to 15.1 kJ·mol−1 in the
energy barrier of the amide bond rotation. The C(O)−N bond
rotation of N,N-dipropyl nicotinamide 149 was 450-fold faster
in the bound state than free in solution (Scheme 6b). The
inversion-rotation process of bound protonated amines was
also accelerated by inclusion in the Ga(III)-cage 14612−.314 It
is worth mentioning here that the rate of hydrolysis of
secondary amides in basic water was enhanced when the guests
were included in the octahedral Pt(II)-cage 140d12+, as shown
recently by Takezawa, Fujita, and co-workers.297

The binding and stabilization of reactive cationic species
suggested the application of the Ga(III)-cage 14612−to
mediate or catalyze chemical transformations involving
cationic substrates or occurring through cationic transition
states.303,312 The application of the Ga(III)-cage 14612−as
catalyst in substoichiometric amounts was required to
circumvent the issue of product inhibition. That is, the
reaction product must not compete with the substrate for the
cage’s cavity.
The aza-Cope rearrangement of allylenammonium315 and
propargylenammonium316 cations involves charged starting
materials, intermediates, and transition states. A net positive
charge of the bound guest is maintained throughout the
reaction. The Ga(III)-cage 14612−accelerated the aza-Cope
rearrangement of enammonium bound species, such as 150+
(Scheme 7a), by almost 3 orders of magnitude with respect to
the background reaction taking place in water under identical
experimental conditions.315 The tetrahedral cage 14612−
included the allylenammonium cation 150+ in a chairlike
conformation (Scheme 7a), which was suitable to undergo the
aza-Cope rearrangement. Most likely, the eﬀect of the cage as
catalyst resided on the stabilization of the bound substrate in
its high-energy reactive conformation. Interestingly, the
reaction product was an iminium cation, which was further
hydrolyzed to the corresponding aldehyde, probably by leaking
in the bulk aqueous solution. The neutral aldehyde that was
produced could not compete with the cationic guest (starting
material) for the cavity of the anionic Ga(III)-cage 14612−,
thus enabling catalytic turnover.
On the other hand, the Nazarov cyclization of neutral penta-
methyl pentadienol 151 (Scheme 7b) involves a positively
charged transition state. In this case, the net charge of the
bound guest changes throughout the reaction. The Ga(III)-
cage 14612−mainly catalyzed the Nazarov cyclization of
pentadienol 151 through the stabilization of the positively
charged transition state, leading to a remarkable rate
acceleration, kcatatalyzed/kuncatalyzed ∼106, in water at pH =
11.317 In this case, maleimide was used as a trapping agent to
give the corresponding Diels−Alder product and enable
catalytic turnover (Scheme 7b). Otherwise, the Ga(III)-cage
14612−used as catalyst in the Nazarov cyclization suﬀered of
product inhibition.

The eﬀect of the overall charge of the metallo-cage in its
catalytic performance was recently investigated by Bergman,
Raymond, Toste, and co-workers using two isostructural
tetrahedral cages: the Ga(III)-cage 146 and the analogous
Si(IV)-cage.318 The Si(IV)-cage had eight negative charges,
whereas the Ga(III)-cage 146 had 12. As could be expected,
the two cages provided similar rate constant values for the aza-
Cope rearrangement (Scheme 7a) because the net charge of
the bound substrate was maintained constant throughout the
reaction. Nevertheless, the Ga(III)-cage 14612−induced an
increase in the rate constant of the Nazarov cyclization
reaction (Scheme 7b) that was almost 3 orders of magnitude
larger than that for the Si(IV)-cage. In this case, the more
negatively charged Ga(III)-cage (z = −12) stabilized better the
cationic transition state, which was generated throughout the
reaction, than the Si(IV)-cage (z = −8) (see section 6.2 for the
eﬀect of the overall charge of noncovalent capsules on
chemical transformations in their interiors).
Furthermore, the Ga(III)-cage 14612−also catalyzed the
hydrolysis of orthoformate esters,319 such as 152 (Scheme 7c),
and acetals320 in basic water. Orthoformates and acetals are
stable in neutral or basic water solution but are readily
hydrolyzed in acidic media. The Ga(III)-cage 14612−bound
the orthoformate ester or acetal and catalyzed their hydrolysis
reaction in water at pH > 10. The hydrolysis of orthoformates
gave the formate anion as product, which did not compete for
binding to the anionic Ga(III)-cage 14612−with the starting
material319 (Scheme 7c). On the other hand, the hydrolysis of
acetals produced the corresponding aldehyde, which was
further converted into its hydrate in the bulk aqueous
solution.320 Both products were less hydrophobic guests than
the reactants, thus enabling catalytic turnover.
Hunter, Ward, and co-workers designed a cubic M8L12 cage
153 based on Co(II) metal ions and pyridyl-pyrazolyl
ligands321 (Figure 67). The cationic metal centers and the
hydroxymethyl substituents of the ligands imparted water
solubility to the assembly. The Co(II)-cage 153 was positively
charged (z = +16), featuring a cavity volume of ca. 400 Å3.322
In the solid state, the Co(II)-cage 153 showed ten water
molecules included in its hydrophobic cavity.323 The included
water molecules established fewer hydrogen bonds than those
in the bulk solution. The release of the bound water molecules
led to guest binding processes that were mainly enthalpically
driven. This ﬁnding was in striking contrast with the entropy
driven binding processes described for Pd(II)-cages 140a,b
(vide supra). To reconcile both observations, we highlight the
fact that the 10 water molecules included in the octahedral
Pd(II)-cages 140a,b were assigned an ice-like structure, which
should provide a larger number of hydrogen bonds. In any
case, the solvation and desolvation processes, as well as the
complexes’ stoichiometries, were very diﬀerent to allow a fair
comparison of the two binding metallo-cages.
The Co(II)-cage 15316+ included preferentially neutral
guests over anionic species in water solution.321,323−325
Interestingly, the results obtained in the binding studies of a
series of cyclic ketones, from cyclopentanone to cyclo-
undecanone, 154 (Figure 68), demonstrated the existence of
a linear relationship between the free energy of binding and the
surface area of the guests.324 This relationship quantiﬁed in ca.
0.3 kJ·mol−1·Å−2 the HE operating in these cage complexes
(see calix[4]pyrroles in section 5.3 for an alternate model
system to quantify the HE). The gain in free energy provided
by the inclusion of an additional methylene group of the
ketone homologous series in the hydrophobic cavity of the
Co(II)-cage 15316+ was calculated to be ca. 5.0 kJ·mol−1.
Cycloundecanone, 154, formed a thermodynamically highly
stable complex with the Co(II)-cage 15316+ in water324 (Figure
72). The 154⊂15316+ cage complex was characterized with a
binding constant value of Ka = 1.2 × 106 M−1. More polar
cyclic guests with larger β values, such as lactams and pyridine
N-oxide, were weakly bound by the Co(II)-cage 15316+,321
(Table 12). For example, the binding constant value
determined for the cage complex of δ-lactam 132 (Figure
62b) was 3 M−1 and 1 M−1 for pyridine N-oxide 127 (Figure
62a). These results, together with the ones obtained in
acetonitrile solution, were interpreted by the authors as an
indication that the hydrogen-bonding component of guest
recognition was switched oﬀin water. In water, the binding of
guests to the Co(II)-cage 15316+ was mainly driven by the HE
and assisted with additional dispersion (van der Waals)
interactions established in the complex. These results indicated
that the important role played by the hydrogen-bonding
interactions in the complexation of polar molecules in water
using “temple” receptors, aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles and, to
some extent, in the case of naphthotubes (section 5) is not
easily translated to other receptor’s designs also equipped with
polar cavities.
The Co(II)-cage 15316+ was also used as catalyst in the
Kemp elimination reaction of benzisoxazole 155 to give 2-
cyanophenolate 156−in basic water326 (Scheme 8). Benzisox-
azole 155 was included in the cavity of the Co(II)-cage 15316+,
mainly through the HE. The resulting 1:1 cage complex had a
signiﬁcant binding aﬃnity (Ka (155⊂15316+) = 4.0 × 103
M−1).327 At the same time, hydroxide anions were bound to
the exterior of the cationic Co(II)-cage via Coulombic
interactions, thus producing an increase in local concentration
at the periphery of the cage complex 155⊂15316+. The bound
benzisoxazole 155 reacted with the local high concentration of
hydroxide to yield the 2-cyanophenolate anion, 156−. The
hydrophilicity of the anion 156−eliminated the competition

with the reactant 155 for the hydrophobic cavity of the
metallo-cage, thus enabling catalytic turnover. The reaction
rate constant was signiﬁcantly enhanced in the presence of the
Co(II)-cage 15316+ in water at pD = 8.5, kcatalyzed/kuncatalyzed = 2
× 105.326,328
Rissanen, Nitschke, and co-workers reported the self-
assembly of a tetrahedral M4L6 cage 157 using Fe(II) metal
ions and biphenyl imine ligands bearing sulfonate groups329
(Figure 67). Similar metallo-cages were obtained by replacing
the Fe(II) metal centers by Co(II) or Ni(II).330 The Fe(II)-
cage 157 was soluble in water owing to the four Fe(II) ions at
the vertices and the outwardly directed sulfonate groups at the
edges of the tetrahedron (overall charge, z = −4). In analogy to
the Raymond’s Ga(III)-cage 146, the Fe(II)-cage 157 was
obtained as a racemic mixture of two T-symmetric homochiral
assemblies, ΔΔΔΔ and ΛΛΛΛ. Metallo-cage 157 featured a
cavity volume of ca. 140 Å3.329
The tetra-anionic Fe(II)-cage 1574−preferentially included
neutral nonpolar guests over polar and cationic ana-
logues.329,331 The inclusion of a suitable neutral guest in the
tetrahedral cavity of 1574−was driven by the HE. For example,
cyclohexane 158 (Figure 68) and 1574−formed a 1:1 cage
complex in water featuring a binding constant value of Ka = 7.1
× 104 M−1.331 In contrast, the cage complex of 1,4-dioxane,
123 (Figure 57), experienced a drop in binding aﬃnity of more
than 2 orders of magnitude, Ka (123⊂1574−) = 1.5 × 102
M−1.331 Aromatic guests were also included in the hydrophobic
cavity of cage 1574−. For example, benzene 159 (Figure 68)
produced an inclusion complex with Fe(II)-cage 1574−in
water with a stability constant of Ka = 3.0 × 103 M−1.331
Binding studies with the tetrahedral Fe(II)-cage 1574−and a
series of guests indicated that the binding aﬃnity of the cage
complexes were directly related to the hydrophobicity of the
guest: the larger the hydrophobicity of the guest, the larger the
binding constant.331 The rate constants for the formation of
the cage complexes of the Fe(II)-cage 1574−were shown to be
dependent on the size and shape of the guest. On the basis of
this ﬁnding, a slippage mechanism was proposed to be
operating for the entrance/exchange of guests in the cage
complexes of 1574−,332 as discussed before for Raymond’s
metallo-cage.
Building on early work by Cram et al. and the entrapment of
reactive species, such as cyclobutadiene or benzyne in covalent
container molecules,333 the tetrahedral Fe(II)-cage 1574−also
oﬀered a hydrophobic environment to protect reactive species
in water.334 For example, white phosphorus (P4) 160 (Figure
68) is air sensitive. Nevertheless, white phosphorus 160 could
be stored in the cavity of the Fe(II)-cage 1574−in water and in
the presence of oxygen over 4 months.335 The stabilization of
160 was rationalized by the constrictive binding of the guest in
the cage’s cavity (Figure 73), rather than by an unfavorable
passage of molecular oxygen through the portals of the cage.
Any oxidized product of 160, as well as the corresponding
transition state, were not good ﬁts for the cavity of the
tetrahedral Fe(II)-cage 1574−.

The inwardly directed polar functions of the metallo-cages
discussed above had weak hydrogen bond donor properties.
To overcome this limitation, Nitschke et al. assembled the
tetrahedral M4L4 Fe(II)-cage 161 using azaphosphatrane
ligands and anions as templating agents336,337 (Figure 67).
The Fe(II)-cage 161 was obtained as a mixture of two isomers.
In one of them, the four azaphosphatrane P+-H groups
converged in the interior of the cavity (T symmetry). In the
other isomer, one of the P+-H groups pointed outward and the
other three were inwardly directed (C3 symmetry). Both
isomeric cages had an overall charge z = +12 and their cavities
were highly polar.
The anion used as templating agent had a signiﬁcant role in
controlling the symmetry of the major assembled isomer of the
Fe(II)-cage 16112+. For example, anions having a volume
smaller than 53 Å3 produced mainly the C3-symmetric cage.
On the contrary, anions featuring a larger volume (>53 Å3)
were more suitable templates for the formation of the T-
symmetric cage.336 One of the isomers of the Fe(II)-cage
16112+ could be converted into the other by the simple
addition of the corresponding anion in solution. The two
isomers of the tetrahedral Fe(II)-cage 16112+ were able to
include one anion in their cavities even in water solution.336
That is, the combination of three/four converging ionic
hydrogen-bonding interactions, with their associated Coulom-
bic forces (section 2), could overcome the energetic cost
associated with anion desolvation in water. Receptor 16112+
represents one of the few examples of metal coordination cages
featuring endohedral polar functions that are capable of
performing eﬃcient recognition of anions in water.338
Other examples of metal coordination cages and their
applications in catalysis were reported in literature.339−342
6.2. Noncovalent Capsules
Noncovalent self-assembled capsules feature an enclosed
cavity,343 which completely isolates the bound guests from
water molecules in the bulk solution.15 Their assembly involves
the use of concave molecular scaﬀolds, such as calix[4]arene
and resorcin[4]arene derivatives.232 The convex shape of the
molecular components provided the curvature necessary for
the ﬁnal capsular assembly. The inner volume of the
supramolecular capsules might accommodate solvent mole-
cules, complementary guests, or a combination of both of
them.344
Crego-Calama, Reinhoudt, and co-workers reported the self-
assembly of dimeric capsules based on calix[4]arene scaﬀolds
through ion-pairing interactions (section 2) in water
solution.345 Two tetra-charged self-complementary calix[4]-
arene derivatives were used for the capsular assembly. One
calix[4]arene derivative, 162, was decorated with carboxylic
acids at the upper rim (Figure 74a). The carboxylic acid groups
of 162 were ionized in water at basic pH giving [162-4H]4−.
The other calix[4]arene derivative, 163, was functionalized
with amidinium groups also at the upper rim, i.e., 1634+ (Figure
74a). The equimolar mixture of the two calix[4]arene
derivatives, [162-4H]4−and 1634+, in water at pH = 9
aﬀorded the heterodimeric capsule [162-4H]4−·1634+ (Figure
74a). Interestingly, the propyl substituents of the amidinium
groups of 1634+ were inwardly directed in the assembled
dimeric capsule and ﬁlled its internal cavity.345 The subsequent
addition of size and shape complementary guests to the
capsule’s [162-4H]4−·1634+ cavity volume, such as 6-amino-2-
methyl quinoline 164 (Figure 74b), provoked the protrusion
of the propyl groups from the capsule’s periphery and the
concomitant encapsulation of the guest.346
In section 4.2, we discussed the formation of 1:1 inclusion
complexes derived from the octa-acid deep-cavity cavitand 95
(Figure 39). We provided some hints on the tendency to
aggregate of the octa-carboxylate and octa-ammonium
cavitands, [95-8H]8−and 968+, in water solution. Using this
ability and in the presence of suitable guests, Gibb and Gibb
demonstrated that the octa-acid 95 self-assembled into a
dimeric capsule,246 952 (Figure 75). The dimerization of 95
was driven by the HE (see section 2.1) owing to the water
desolvation of the large aromatic surface area at the cavity
portal. In basic water, the peripheral carboxylic acids of 952
were converted into carboxylates warranting water solubility to
the dimeric capsule, [952-16H]16−.
The cavity volume of the dimeric capsule [952-16H]16−was
large enough to accommodate steroids, such as estradiol 165
(Figure 74b). The A ring of bound 165 was included in one
half, while the D ring occupied the opposite half of the capsule
[952-16H]16−(Figure 75). The quantitative formation of the
ternary 1:2 guest/host complex at millimolar concentration,
165⊂[952-16H]16−, indicated that the stability constant value
was larger than 108 M−2.246
The deep-cavity cavitand [95-8H]8−was also assembled into
dimeric capsules in the presence of n-alkanes, from nonane to
heptadecane.347 Alkanes shorter than n-decane ﬁt comfortably
in the cavity of [952-16H]16−in extended conformations. On
the contrary, longer n-alkanes adopted high-energy, com-
pacted-coiled conformations when included in the cavity of the
dimeric capsule.348
The stabilization (binding) of high-energy conformers in the
cavity of [952-16H]16−was also investigated using piperidine
derivatives by Ramamurthy et al.349 For example, in solution,
piperidine 166 adopted a conformation in which the O-propyl
substituent occupied an equatorial position (Scheme 9). The

addition of 166 to a millimolar water solution of deep-cavity
cavitand [95-8H]8−induced the formation of equimolar
amounts of two kinetically stable encapsulation complexes on
the 1H NMR chemical shift time scale (Scheme 9). One of the
encapsulation complexes corresponded to the equatorial
conformer of 166, equatorial 166⊂[952-16H]16−. The other
encapsulation isomer included the higher-energy axial con-
former of the piperidine derivative 166, axial 166⊂[952-
16H]16−.
The homodimeric capsules derived from the self-assembly of
[95-8H]8−and 968+ (Figure 39) featured the same overall
charge of 16 but opposite sign and complementary inner and
outer electrostatic potential surfaces. In analogy to the
stabilization of charged species exerted by the overall charge
of water-soluble metal coordination cages (section 6.1), the
signs of the electrostatic potential surfaces and overall charges
of the noncovalent dimeric capsules [952-16H]16‑ and [962]16+
inﬂuenced the reactivity of bound guests. Recently, Gibb et al.
showed the eﬀect exerted by the two dimeric capsules, [952-
16H]16−and [962]16+, in the intramolecular cyclization
reaction of included long-chain α,ω-alkanes bearing terminal
thiol and halide groups.350 The cyclization reaction required
the deprotonation of the terminal thiol group, at one end of
the molecule, with a base to produce the corresponding
thiolate. The thiolate then reacted with the halide carbon at the
other end of the alkyl chain to render the cyclic product. For
example, α,ω-thiol 167 was quantitatively encapsulated in
either [952-16H]16−or [962]16+ capsules featuring a J-binding
motif350,351 (Scheme 10a). The pKa value of the bound thiol
was larger in the anionic capsule [952-16H]16−than in the
cationic counterpart [962]16+. This was translated into an
energetic stabilization of the thiolate anion upon deprotona-
tion in [962]16+ or, in other words, the acidity of the bound
thiol was enhanced in the cationic dimeric capsule. Therefore,
in basic water and in the interior of the anionic capsule [952-
16H]16−, 167 underwent an intramolecular cyclization reaction
to give the cyclic product 168 in ca. 8 h (Scheme 10a). In
striking contrast and under identical reaction conditions, the
same cyclization reaction took place in <2 min using the
cationic capsule [962]16+.350
Gibb, Ramamurthy, and co-workers also applied the dimeric
capsule [952-16H]16−to control the excited-state properties of
encapsulated guests352 and alter reaction pathways of photo-
chemical processes taking place in its interior.353,354 For
example, direct irradiation of a suspension of acenaphthylene
169 (Scheme 10b) in water gave a mixture of dimeric
products: 40% syn-170 and 60% anti-170. In striking contrast
and under the same irradiation conditions, acenaphthylene
169, in the presence of [95-8H]8−, led to the quantitative
formation of the syn-dimer 170 in borate buﬀer solution at pH
= 9355 (Scheme 10b). The guest 169 and octa-carboxylate [95-
8H]8−formed a 2:2 host/guest encapsulation complex,
1692⊂[952-16H]16−. The two molecules of 169 were bound
in a syn-fashion, favoring the formation of syn-170 upon
irradiation. The syn-dimer 170 nicely ﬁts in the cavity of the
capsule [952-16H]16−, but the anti-dimer 170 did not. The
latter was too large to be accommodated within the capsule’s
cavity. More recently, Ramamurthy et al. coupled the
photoisomerization of a neutral spiropyran into its zwitterionic
merocyanine form with the reversible disassembly/assembly of
the dimeric capsule [952-16H]16−.356
Despite the competitive nature of water for hydrogen-
bonding, Rebek et al. demonstrated that the tetra-cationic
benzimidazolone resorcin[4]arene deep cavitand 1714+ self-
assembled quantitatively into a cylindrical homodimeric
capsule [1712]8+ in the presence of suitable nonpolar guests239
(Figure 76). The series of guests used as templates included:
large aromatic molecules and long n-alkanes, such as undecane
172. The formation of the dimeric capsule, [1712]8+, was
mainly driven by the HE owing to the encapsulation of large
nonpolar surfaces of the host and the guest, and the formation
of a seam of bifurcated hydrogen-bonding interactions at the
equator of the assembly.
Recently, Rebek, Yu, and co-workers showed that related
dimeric capsules could be assembled in water solution using
resorcin[4]arene deep cavitands with 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole
walls.357 In the latter case, the dimeric capsule was held
together by the hydrophobic eﬀect and, more interestingly, by
chalcogen-bonding interactions (see section 2) between the

165⊂[952-16H]16−encapsulation complex. The resorcin[4]arenes are

7. COMPARISON OF THE BINDING PROPERTIES OF
DIFFERENT MACROCYCLES WITH SOME SELECTED
GUESTS
In this section, we compare the binding mode of selected
receptors, corresponding to diﬀerent families, with a common
guest molecule featuring one or multiple binding sites and
displaying neutral or charged character.
Dougherty et al. investigated the binding of adamantane
trimethylammonium iodide salt 17 (Figure 78) with the
ethenoanthracene-based cyclophane 15 (Figure 77) bearing p-
xylyl spacers in borate buﬀer at pD = 9.107 Guest 17 is
heteroditopic and possesses two diﬀerent binding sites: the
nonpolar adamantyl residue and the polar trimethylammonium
group. Both residues are good ﬁts, in terms of size, shape, and
functional complementarity with the receptor’s nonpolar
aromatic cavity. The calculated complexation-induced shifts
(CIS) for the protons of the bound guest suggested that the
trimethylammonium cationic residue was deeper in the
aromatic cavity than the nonpolar adamantyl counterpart
(Figure 10). In addition to the HE, the 17+⊂154−complex (Ka
= 8.2 × 104 M−1) was stabilized by cation−π interactions and
long-range Coulombic interactions between the carboxylates
and the alkylammonium group.

Isaacs et al. reported the complexation of 17 with
cucurbit[7]uril 45 (Figure 77) in buﬀer solution at pH ∼
4.7.175 The 17+⊂45 complex (Ka = 1.7 × 1012 M−1) showed an
increase in 7 orders of magnitude with respect to the 17+⊂154−
counterpart. It is known that the adamantane skeleton is
complementary to the cavity of CB7 45, and its inclusion is
mainly driven by the HE. Most likely, the trimethylammonium
residue protrudes outside of the cavity and locates in the center
of the polar portal deﬁned by the seven CO groups of the
glycoluril units establishing multiple cation−dipole and polar
hydrogen-bonding interactions. These extra interactions can be
quantiﬁed to be in the order of 28.4 kJ·mol−1. The 17+⊂45
complex can be placed among the tightest known to date.
The binding of the adamantane trimethylammonium 17+
(added as chloride salt) was also studied by Shinkai et al. with
the tetra-sodium salt of tetra-sulfonate calix[4]arene 69
(Figure 77).206−208 The authors described the formation of a
1:1 complex, 17+⊂694−, in 0.1 M phosphate buﬀer at pD = 7.3
(Ka = 2.1 × 104 M−1). The CIS experienced by the proton
atoms of bound 17+ (adamantyl methylene and N-methyl
groups moved upﬁeld) indicated that 17+ was not bound in a
selective manner. That is, both the adamantyl and ammonium
moieties of 17+ were included in the aromatic cavity of 694−.
This result was in agreement with the ﬁndings of Dougherty et
al. in the binding of 17+ with water-soluble cyclophanes, i.e.,
154−(vide supra). They proposed the existence of cation−π
interactions between the guest
+NMe3 residue and the π-
systems of the host, which may also be operative in the binding
with tetra-sulfonate calix[4]arene 694−. Nevertheless, the
sulfonate groups at the upper rim of 694−provided a strong
anionic ﬁeld. In addition, the anionic sulfonate groups were
involved in Coulombic interactions with the cationic bound
17+.
Dougherty et al.109 and Shinkai et al.207 reported the
thermodynamic parameters of the complexation processes of
17+ with receptors 154−and 694−. In both cases and at 298 K,
the binding was mainly driven by enthalpy (ΔH = −19.6 kJ·
mol−1 for 154−and −23.8 kJ·mol−1 for 694−). The
corresponding entropy terms were smaller (TΔS = +10.5 kJ·
mol−1 for 154−and +0.8 kJ·mol−1 for 694−) but also favorable.
The thermodynamic signature of both binding processes at
298 K is akin to a “nonclassical” HE. However, while Shinkai et
al. described a good linear relationship for the plot of ln Ka vs
T−1 (25−80 °C), which is indicative of a negligible ΔCp value,
Dougherty et al. observed a signiﬁcant curvature (ΔCp ≠0)
(25−33 °C). The mathematical analysis of the nonlinear ln Ka
vs T−1 data using an adjusted van’t Hoﬀequation allowing for
a temperature invariant heat capacity change returned ΔCp =
−418 J·mol−1· K−1 for the formation of the 17+⊂154−complex.
We commented in the introduction that the existence of a large
and negative heat capacity value for binding processes in water
could be indicative of the importance of the HE. In turn, large
ΔCp values produce signiﬁcant enthalpy−entropy compensa-
tion (EEC) eﬀects with changes in temperature. This
phenomenon makes the interpretation of thermodynamic
parameters diﬃcult and may even lead to hydrophobic
crossover: the thermodynamic signature of the binding process
is modiﬁed from “classical” to “nonclassical” HE with
temperature. For this reason, we agree with Ernst and Gibb
in the reduced utility of the classiﬁcation of a binding event as

driven by the “classical” or “nonclassical” HE.11 For the
formation of the 17+⊂154−complex, the enthalpy−entropy
crossover was not observed in the range of studied temper-
atures. However, at 333 K, the binding became more favored
by enthalpy (ΔH = −34.3 kJ·mol−1) and slightly opposed by
entropy (TΔS = −3.3 kJ·mol−1).
In contrast, an enthalpy−entropy crossover was indeed
detected at 323 K in the binding of 4-methylquinoline, a
neutral guest, with cyclophane 16 featuring a more hydro-
phobic cavity than 15 (Figure 77). In host 16, cyclohexyl
groups were used instead of the phenyl spacers of 15. At 298
K, the formation of the 4-methylquinoline⊂164−complex was
exclusively driven by entropy but became only favored by
enthalpy at 333 K (ΔCp = −794 J·mol−1·K−1).
In comparison, the binding of 4-methylquinoline with
receptor 154−displayed thermodynamic components and
changes with temperature (ΔH = −41.0 kJ·mol−1, TΔS =
−11.3 kJ·mol−1 at 298 K, and ΔCp = −543 J·mol−1·K−1) that
were in line with those determined for the complexation of the
cationic trimethylammonium adamantane guest 17+ (vide
supra). The authors commented that the magnitudes of the
entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding at 298 K
served to identify the role played by electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions. Overall, the described results serve
to illustrate the complexity of the binding processes in water
that derives from the detailed analysis of the thermodynamic
components and its associated changes with temperature. We
insist in considering the magnitude and sign of ΔCp as the
most reliable source indicating the role played by the HE in
binding.
Dicationic compounds containing a spacer of reduced
polarity, like dimethyl viologen 282+ (Figure 78), are tritopic
guests. Consequently, its eﬃcient binding in water solution
requires multitopic hosts having size, shape, and function
complementarity. In water solution, tetra-carboxylate pillar[5]-
arene 2610−(Figure 77) possesses 10 carboxylate groups
diverging from its aromatic and nonpolar cavity. The terminal
carboxylates are covalently attached through oxy-methylene
chains to the 1,4-positions of the phenyl units deﬁning the
receptor’s electron-rich aromatic cavity. This substitution
renders the rims of the two open portals of 2610−function-
alized with ﬁve carboxylate anions each. The aromatic cavity of
2610−is adequate for the inclusion of the electron-deﬁcient
4,4′-bipyridinium spacer of 282+. Thus, the interaction of 2610−
with 282+ produced a 1:1 inclusion complex (Ka = 8.2 × 104
M−1) stabilized by the HE, donor−acceptor aromatic
interactions, charge-transfer, and multiple Coulombic inter-
actions between the negatively charged carboxylate residues
located at the host’s portals and the cationic ends of the guest
(methylpyridinium) protruding from the receptor’s cavity
(Figure 15). The formed 282+⊂2610−complex featured a
pseudorotaxane topology. It also displayed fast exchange
dynamics on the chemical shift time scale with the bound
counterparts. The inclusion of 282+ increased signiﬁcantly the
rotation energy barrier of the oxy-methylene units function-
alized with the terminal carboxylates that are located at both
rims of bound 2610−.129
Cucurbit[7]uril 45 (Figure 77) also formed a 1:1 inclusion
complex with 282+ in water solution (Ka = 1.0 × 105 M−1 in
H2O containing 0.2 M NaCl).191 The β-aromatic protons of
bound 282+ experienced an upﬁeld shift of more than 1.5 ppm,
evidencing the inclusion of the guest in the nonpolar cavity of
cucurbit[7]uril 45. The obtained results reﬂected a good ﬁt
between the cavity of 45 and the cross-section of the 4,4′-
bipyridinium residue. Likewise, the similarity of distances
between the two N-atoms of bipyridinium 282+ and the centers
of the planes deﬁned by the carbonyl oxygen atoms at the
portals of 45 maximizes multiple ion−dipole interactions in the
282+ ⊂45 inclusion complex. The binding aﬃnity of the
neutral cucurbit[7]uril 45 receptor for dimethyl viologen 282+
is similar to that of deca-carboxylate pillar[5]arene 2610−
(Figure 77). Most likely, the HE plays an important role in
driving the formation of both complexes. The fact that
cucurbit[7]uril 45 is a neutral receptor could maximize this
eﬀect.
Cucurbit[8]uril 46 (Figure 77) has a slightly larger cavity
than its homologue 45, lacking one glycoluril bis-methylene
unit (cavity diameters of 8.8 and 7.3 Å, respectively).
Nevertheless, 46 binds 282+ and produces a 1:1 inclusion
complex (Ka = 8.5 × 105 M−1).180−182 The included dimethyl
viologen 282+ only ﬁlls half of the cavity volume of 46.
Probably, the coinclusion of another molecule of 282+ is
disfavored by repulsive Coulombic interactions. The empty
space remaining in the 282+⊂46 complex is similar to the
cavity size of 45. At millimolar concentration, the addition of a
size complementary, electron-rich, neutral guest, i.e., 2,6-
dihydroxynaphthalene 61 (Figure 78) to the 282+⊂46 complex
induced the quantitative formation of the ternary complex [61·
282+]⊂46 (Figure 29).
Dimethyl viologen 28 was also bound by the hepta-sulfonate
calix[7]arene 75 (Figure 77).223 At pD = 7.3, [75-2H]9−
presents nine negative charges (seven sulfonate groups and
two deprotonated phenols). Receptor [75-2H]9−is very
ﬂexible conformationally and displays a large aromatic cavity
suitable for the inclusion of sizable aromatic guests. The
282+⊂[75-2H]9−complex was characterized by a binding
constant of Ka = 3.2 × 104 M−1. The superior binding aﬃnity
of dicharged cationic guests compared to monocharged
analogues suggested that Coulombic interactions between
the sulfonate and the ammonium groups were important for
the binding. Molecular modeling studies revealed that 282+ was
sandwiched between the aromatic walls deﬁning the cavity of
[75-2H]9−. The positive nitrogen atoms of the ammonium
groups were located close to sulfonate substituents.
The examples commented above highlight the importance of
charge-based electrostatic interactions (i.e., Coulombic or
charge−charge, ion−dipole, and charge-assisted dipole−di-

pole) in combination with the HE for the binding of charged
organic guests in water solution. The eﬃcient and selective
binding of small molecular weight molecules, featuring polar
but neutral character, requests the application of additional
principles. The HE is also responsible for the binding strength
of the complexes derived from these guests. However, the
selectivity in the binding of polar neutral guests is a direct
consequence of the establishment of additional neutral
electrostatic interactions (dipole−dipole) upon complex
formation. The creation of these latter interactions demands
the placement of converging polar groups in the nonpolar
cavities of the synthetic receptors. This modiﬁcation is
synthetically challenging owing to the widespread use of
aromatic panels to shape the nonpolar cavities of the receptors.
The cubic Co(II)-cage 153 (Figure 77) described by
Hunter, Ward, and co-workers presents endohedral methylene
CH polar groups that are capable to form hydrogen-bonding
interactions with the oxygen atoms of encapsulated polar
guests.321,324 The polar CHs are not accessible to bulk water
molecules owing to its deep inclusion in the cage’s nonpolar
cavity. The authors demonstrated that the binding aﬃnities of
the 1:1 cage complexes formed by 15316+, and a series of
homologous aliphatic cyclic ketones increased with guest size
(increase in hydrophobic surface area). The peak in binding
aﬃnity was reached with cycloundecanone 154 (Figure 78).
The corresponding 1:1 cage complex displayed a 50% packing
coeﬃcient, which is close to the optimal 55% noted by Rebek
and co-workers.160 The contribution of the polar hydrogen-
bonding interactions to the binding of 15316+ was investigated
using a series of six-membered rings containing a polar group
with diﬀerent hydrogen-bonding accepting capabilities (β
value), i.e., ketone, lactone, lactam, and N-oxide. For this
second guest’s series, the binding aﬃnities decreased as the β
value, and thus guest polarity, increased. For example, pyridine
N-oxide 127 (Figure 78) was bound by 15316+ with a low
binding aﬃnity of Ka = 1 M−1. The obtained result indicated
that in water, the binding of the metallo-cage 15316+ to the
series of six-membered guest seemed to have the hydrogen-
bonding component switched oﬀ.
Water-soluble “four-wall” aryl-extended and super aryl-
extended calix[4]pyrroles, as well as its cavitand derivatives
are good receptors for the binding of small polar molecules
(section 5.3). The formed inclusion complexes have 1:1
stoichiometry and are stabilized by a combination of the HE
and neutral electrostatic polar interactions: hydrogen-bonds,
CH−π, etc. Inspired by the work of Hunter, Ward, and co-
workers, we used the bis-phosphonate cavitand 130b (Figure
77) to assess the hydrogen-bonding contribution to the
binding of small polar guests in water solution.285 To this end,
we employed a series of six-membered cyclic polar guest
analogous to that employed by Hunter, Ward, and co-workers.
Surprisingly for us, the trend in binding aﬃnities displayed by
the cavitand 130b4+ was opposite to the calculated lipophilicity
values of the guests (log P). Conversely, we observed the
existence of a linear relationship, displaying a positive slope,
between the calculated binding aﬃnity values and the
hydrogen-bonding accepting capabilities (β), as well as polarity
values of the guests (log P). For example, the complex of
130b4+ with cyclohexanone 133 was 2 orders of magnitude less
stable than that of the more polar six-membered cyclic urea
135 (Figure 78). We concluded that the polar binding site of
130b4+ seemed to provide a better environment for the
solvation of the polar guest than water. Interestingly, pyridine
N-oxide 127 (Figure 78) was bound by 130b4+ with an aﬃnity
value Ka (127⊂130b4+) = 6.9 × 106 M−1. This represents a 6
orders of magnitude increase with respect to the metallo-cage
15316+. The described results support the importance of the
placement of converging groups in the nonpolar cavities of
synthetic receptors, with large hydrogen-bonding accepting (β)
or donating capabilities (α), for the eﬃcient recognition of
small polar molecules in water. To improve binding
competence, the receptor’s polar groups should not be
accessible for direct solvation with bulk water molecules
(reduced hydration of the binding sites).
This section is used as example in comparing the binding
properties of selected receptors with a common guest. Similar
comparisons can be drawn from other examples discussed in
the text.
8. OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK
We revised selected families of water-soluble synthetic
receptors featuring well-deﬁned internal cavities. The early
designs involved cyclophanes featuring 2D hydrophobic
cavities open at two opposite ends. These cavities were easily
accessible by bulk water molecules. Subsequently, oligocyclic
cyclophanes were introduced with the goal of shaping 3D
cavities and limiting the access of water molecules to their
interiors. The inclusion complexes of cyclophanes with
hydrophobic guests displayed acceptable levels of thermody-
namic stability (Ka > 103 M−1). However, their kinetic
stabilities tended to be low on the 1H NMR chemical shift
time scale.
A further development in the design of 2D receptors
consisted on increasing their concavity and/or depth. These
modiﬁcations aimed at increasing the contact surface area
between host and guest and reducing the portal’s size in
relation to cavity volume. In this endeavor, bent glycoluril units
were used to prepare cucurbit[n]urils and bambus[n]urils.
Following a related strategy, pillar[n]arenes came to live. The
portals of these 2D receptors contain polar groups, but their
cavities are rather hydrophobic.
The improvement in host−guest contact surface area
reached an initial milestone with the development of
calix[n]arenes and resorcin[4]arenes. These receptors were
hydrophobic and possessed shallow concave cavities, closed at
one end and open at the opposite end. Their upper rims may
have attached water-solubilizing groups, which could also
interact with polar groups of the bound guest. To minimize
interferences with the binding event and allow further
elaboration of the receptors’ cavity, water-solubilizing groups
were moved at the lower rim. At this point, water-soluble
cavitands and deep cavitands were developed. They featured a
deep and conformationally more rigid cavity than the parent
receptors leading to an improvement of the thermodynamic
and kinetic stabilities of the resulting inclusion complexes.
However, the use of aromatic panels in shaping their cavities
created diﬃculties for the placement of converging polar
groups and for their solubilization in water.
This structural limitation has been addressed with the
introduction of “temple” receptors, naphthotubes, and aryl-
and super aryl-extended calix[4]pyrroles. We are convinced
that receptors having functionalized internal cavities are
excellent candidates for the eﬃcient and selective recognition
of polar guests. We expect to see developments and
breakthroughs in this area of research in the next years.

Molecular encapsulation represents the ultimate goal of
molecular recognition. We described two strategies, that is, the
self-assembly of metallo-cage and capsular containers. Metallo-
cages possessed open portals that allowed reversible guest
binding. On the other hand, noncovalent capsules, stabilized
by weaker interactions, lack of sizable portals. The reversible
guest binding in the latter assemblies required their partial
dissociation. Most metallo-cages and capsules displayed
hydrophobic cavities. Examples of placing convergent func-
tional groups in their interiors are scarce. We also foresee a
signiﬁcant development in this direction in the years to come.
Because catalysis deals with the binding of dynamic targets,
we included few applications of water-soluble synthetic
receptors in the stabilization of high-energy intermediates
and transition states. We expect this area of research to fructify
and prosper in the future because catalytic turnover was
demonstrated to be more general than initially imagined.
Last but not least, research on water structure and solvation
is required to fully understand the hydrophobic and the
Hofmeister eﬀects and to elaborate reliable theoretical
prediction models for the accurate calculation of host−guest
binding properties in water.
We hope that this review will serve as a reference for all
those interested in molecular recognition in water. We also
expect that the examples included herein will inspire
researchers to design new receptors featuring speciﬁc proper-
ties for their use in other fundamental areas and/or real-world
applications.
