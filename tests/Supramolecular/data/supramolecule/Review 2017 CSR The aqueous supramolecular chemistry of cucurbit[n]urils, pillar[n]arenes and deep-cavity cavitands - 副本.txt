This tutorial review summarizes the continuing exploration of three prominent water-soluble hosts:
cucurbiturils, pillar[n]arenes and deep-cavity cavitands. As we describe, these hosts are revealing how
orchestrating the hydrophobic eﬀect can lead to a broad range of properties and applications, from:
nano-reactors, supramolecular polymers, stimuli-responsive biointerfaces, switches, and novel purification
devices. We also describe how their study is also revealing more details about the properties of water and
aqueous solutions.
Introduction
Aqueous supramolecular chemistry is dominated by two inter-
related topics: the hydrophobic eﬀect and the Hofmeister eﬀect.
The first of these pertains to how non-polar molecules dissolve
(or do not dissolve) in water,1 whilst the second pertains to how
salts modulate the properties of water and aqueous solutions; one
prominent example of which is how salts modulate the hydro-
phobic eﬀect.2 Though we do not have a full understanding of
these phenomena, especially at the molecular level,3 we do know
that the hydrophobic eﬀect is dependent on both size4 and shape5
of a solute. It also seems to be the case that contrary to previous
thoughts, the Hofmeister eﬀect does not control the hydrophobic
eﬀect by changing the properties of water itself. Rather, recent
evidence suggests that instead of indirectly influencing a solute, the
cation and anion of a salt directly interact with a solute. There is
still much to learn about these phenomena, but in the mean time
supramolecular chemists, having recently identified some fasci-
nating new kinds of water-soluble hosts, have forged ahead with
attempting to learn how the hydrophobic eﬀect can be harnessed.
This tutorial review takes three prominent hosts, cucurbiturils,
pillar[n]arenes, and deep-cavity cavitands, and summarizes how
their distinctive structures engender properties intimately tied to
their form. We hope that in doing so we inspire others to delve into
the murky waters of aqueous supramolecular chemistry.

Cucurbit[n]urils
Preamble
Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n] = 5–8, 10, 13–15) are a family of macro-
cyclic molecules with remarkable aqueous host–guest chemistry.
They are composed of n glycoluril units bridged by 2n methylene
units to form a macrocycle with a hydrophobic cavity that is
accessible by two identical portals (Fig. 1). CB[6] was the first of
these to be synthesized in 1905 by Berhend, but the structure
was not known until it was solved by Mock in the 1980s. CB[6]
was studied as a molecular container with interesting properties,
including the rate acceleration of regiospecific reactions. The
CB[n] family6 was introduced by Kim7 and Day8 in the early
2000s. By heating glycoluril and formaldehyde under acidic
conditions at high temperature (110 1C) the thermodynamic
product, CB[6], is formed almost exclusively; however, at lower
temperatures (75–100 1C) the kinetic products of the reaction
(mainly CB[5], CB[7], and CB[8]) along with CB[6] can be pro-
duced and isolated, along with a small amount of the larger
homologues. In 2016, two more members of the CB family were
isolated, CB[13] and CB[15].9 Like CB[14], they adopt a twisted
structure. Much of the early work on CB[n] including Mock’s
structural characterisation of CB[6] and early investigations
into the host–guest chemistry in the 1980s, the characterisation
of the properties of CB[n] (n = 5–8, 10) and the emerging host–
guest chemistry of the newly discovered homologues was reviewed
thoroughly by Isaacs in 2005.10 The remarkably inert environment
inside the cavity of CB[n] is more like the gas phase than any
other form of matter because there is very little electron density
in the cavity itself; there are no functional groups or lone pairs
of electrons pointing inward. Consequently, CB[n] show a pre-
ference for guests that are hydrophobic and have good size
complementarity with the cavity. Each portal is made from
n ureido carbonyls; the proximity of these carbonyls leads to a

ring that is very electronegative (Fig. 2). The effect of the electro-
static potential is manifested in the host–guest chemistry: all
CB[n] show a distinct preference to interact with cationic species
over neutral species and even more so over anionic species. The
portal diameter is generally smaller than that of the cavity,
which results in host–guest complexes with low dissociation
rates. Generally, CB[n] prefer amphiphilic guests that combine
a cationic group with a hydrophobic core. The aqueous solubi-
lity of the CB[n] family varies by member. CB[5] and CB[7] show
moderate water solubility (20–30 mM) whereas CB[6] and CB[8]
are much less soluble in water. Their solubility increases in acidic
solutions, since the carbonyl portals interact with hydronium
ions facilitating the dissolution. Under neutral conditions, the
addition of alkali metal salts is also an efficient solubilizing
method. Furthermore, the solubility of the CB[n] tends to increase
upon incorporating a guest molecule; especially a positively
charged one. Despite their relatively low solubility, there are
therefore several ways that the host–guest chemistry of CB[n]
can be translated into aqueous chemistry applications. The
combination of these properties has allowed the realisation
of many aqueous chemistry applications. CB[n] applications
include acting as reaction containers, as a tool to functionalize
planar and particulate surfaces, and in sensing. There have
been several reviews published recently which outline these
applications as well as the fundamental studies on CB[n] host–
guest chemistry.11–14 In this review, two unique features of CB
chemistry are highlighted. First, the ability of CB[8] to form
ternary complexes and how this can be utilized to build supra-
molecular assemblies and functionalize aqueous interfaces.
Second, the remarkably high-affinity binding of CB[7] towards
ferrocene, adamantane and other ammonium-derived guests
in water.
The curious case of CB[8]
The standout feature of CB[8] is its ability to form ternary com-
plexes with either 1:2 (host:guest) or 1:1:1 (host:guest 1:guest 2)
stoichiometry with a variety of guest molecules. Among these,
charge-transfer (CT) complexes, where one guest is a p–donor
and the other is a p–acceptor, form particularly stable ternary
complexes. CT complexes can form supramolecular assemblies,
such as rotaxanes and catenanes, spontaneously; they can
be further stabilized when encapsulated in CB[8]. The first
example reported by Kim and co-workers15 consisted of methyl
viologen (MV2+, p–acceptor) and 2,6-hydroxynaphthalene (HN,
p–donor), which forms a stable charge transfer complex inside
CB[8] spontaneously. The host markedly enhances the CT inter-
action to give a stable ternary complex. Complexes of this
type form spontaneously when the components are mixed in
a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio. The complexes also form in a step-wise manner;
the electron-deficient guest binds first to CB[8] and the electron
rich component is incorporated second (a process that is
often very exothermic). The electron-rich guest does not bind
to CB[8] in the absence of an electron poor guest. This well-
defined donor–acceptor behaviour provides a unique opportunity
to construct, stable supramolecular assemblies in water and at
aqueous interfaces. The donor–acceptor moieties can be incor-
porated into the same molecule (D–A), which can then interact
with CB[8] to give a range of assemblies that varies in complexity.
For example, a D–A molecule can form a looped 1 : 1 complex or
a linear 2 : 2 stacked complex, which can also be extended into a
supramolecular polymer or into a cyclic ‘molecular necklace’.
The earlier work on the construction of supramolecular assem-
blies based on the host-stabilised CT complex formation was
reviewed by Kim.16 Scherman has used CB[8] extensively in the
preparation of supramolecular block copolymers, which can also
be extended into 3D-networks; this important contribution to
the field is discussed in Scherman’s recent review and the
references therein.12 More recently, Scherman has integrated
microfluidics and host–guest chemistry to construct CB[8]-based
microcapsules inside droplets.17 The use of CB[8] to construct
these microcapsules bestows stimuli responsiveness to the
formed materials and may have applications as responsive
cargo delivery vehicles. Another of CB[8]’s interesting features is
that it has intrinsic affinity with specific peptide sequences that
allows the formation of peptide-based charge-transfer complexes.
Aromatic amino acids can act as electron-poor components of a
charge transfer complex; therefore, they can form host-stabilized
complexes with CB[8] and MV2+. Urbach and co-workers have
been the pioneers in this area; they found that tripeptides
containing one tryptophan and two glycine residues (WGG,
GWG, GGW) form CT-complexes with CB[8] and MV2+, and that
the closer the aromatic residue is to the N-terminus the stronger
the interaction. Scherman and co-workers have exploited this by
using CB[8] and MV2+ as an electrochemically responsive system
to capture N-terminal-tryptophan-containing peptides. N-terminal
tryptophan is an electron rich species which forms a CB[8]-
stabilized CT-complexes with MV2+. Thiol labelled MV2+ was
immobilized onto a gold surface; these viologens were then
threaded with CB[8]. The surface was then primed to selectively
capture N-terminal-tryptophan-containing peptides. From a
mixture of peptides, only N-terminal tryptophan peptides were
immobilized. Furthermore, the MV2+ can be reduced to MV+
causing the complex to dissociate and release the peptides. Not
only can a CB[8]–MV2+ surface be used to capture simple bio-
molecules it can also be used to control cell adhesion to a
surface. Jonkheijm and Huskens have used a similar CB[8]–MV2+
surface; however, they employed a simple peptide with an
N-terminal tryptophan (a p–donor) possessing an RGD group
(a peptide sequence that is known to adhere to cells) as the
third component in the ternary complex. When the ternary
complex was formed the RGD group was available for binding,

which allowed cells to adhere to the surface. When the MV2+
was electro-chemically reduced, the complex dissociated and
the tryptophan-containing RGD peptide was released, causing
the cells to detach from the surface. The peptide array can be
regenerated by re-oxidising MV+ back to MV2+. Scherman and
coworkers have extended this principle to prepare a surface
with two orthogonal switching mechanisms (Fig. 3). As well as
using redox chemistry, they also use a light responsive CB[8]
guest, azobenzene. The surface was functionalized with azo-
benzene and the methyl viologen and CB[8] were added from
solution. This allowed the preparation of a tristable system that
may be useful for preparing responsive surfaces at biointerfaces
or for memory applications. The reader is directed to a recent
review (and the references therein) by Zhang and Scherman on
the use of supramolecular chemistry to functionalize aqueous
interfaces for the original work.18
Ultra-high aﬃnity CB-guest pairs
CB[n]s shows very high aﬃnities for specific guests and discri-
minates based on charge and shape. For example, CB[n] aﬃnity
has been reported to be as high as 1017 M1, and they show
selectivity for cationic species, moderate aﬃnity for neutral
guests and little aﬃnity for anionic species. The charge selectivity
can be easily rationalized by considering the highly polarized
ureidyl portal that can make ion–dipole interactions with cationic
guests. While most macrocycles exhibit an enthalpy dominated
hydrophobic effect, it does not usually manifest as high binding
affinity. In the case of CB[n] (CB[7], in particular) the enthalpic
contributions and resultant binding affinities are exceptionally
high because of the unfavourable interactions water molecules
experience in the CB[n] cavity. In this section, we shall discuss the
design and binding affinities of high-affinity guests for CB[7] and
describe the thermodynamic basis of this high affinity. Finally,
we will showcase some of the notable applications of these
high-affinity host–guest pairs. The first high guest affinities for
CB[7] were measured in 2005 by Isaacs19 (NMR) and in a parallel
study by the groups of Kim, Inoue, and Kaifer (ITC).20 The latter
study showed that the neutral ferrocene derivative F1 (Fig. 4)
binds CB[7] with Ka = 109 M1, since it is hydrophobic and has
very good size complementarity with CB[7], thereby filling the
cavity effectively. Higher affinity guests can be achieved by addi-
tion of a cationic group, di(or tri)alkylmethylammonium, onto
the ferrocene core (Fig. 4). The cationic ferrocene derivatives F2
and F3 have affinities of Ka = 1012 M1. At the time these were
the highest affinity, monovalent binding pairs known. The high
affinity of neutral ferrocene and 1000-fold affinity increase upon
the addition of the cationic group suggests that the ferrocene is
well-positioned in the CB[7] cavity and the cationic group is in an
ideal position to make an ion–dipole interaction with the portal.
In 2007, the groups of Inoue, Kim, Isaacs, Kaifer, and Gilson21
wondered whether a higher affinity guest could be realized by
the addition of a second cationic group. Indeed, this is the case,
bis-trimethylammoium ferrocene (F4) has a binding affinity for
CB[7] of 1015 M1, measured by ITC. This was a significant
milestone because it was the first synthetic host–guest pair to
surpass that of biotin–(strept)avidin (Bt–SA), which is the bench-
mark high-affinity binding pair in nature. The X-ray structure of
this complex shows that it is symmetrical and both trimethyl-
ammoniums protrude from the cavity, the ferrocene unit is
slightly tilted to make ion–dipole interactions with the portal.
The complex is exceptionally tight, as shown by a very short
T1 relaxation time for the ferrocenyl protons in the 1H NMR.
Another family of molecules that can form high-affinity com-
plexes with CB[7] are aminoadamantane derivatives. Isaacs and
co-worker19 were the first to measure the affinity aminoadamantane
and found that its binding constant for CB[7] is 1012 M1. Unlike
ferrocene derivatives, further alkylation of the ammonium groups
does not significantly affect the binding affinity. In 2014, Isaacs,

Glaser and Mlinaric-Majerski22 synthesized a new, related dia-
mantane
guest
(D3).
The
diamantane
is
a
symmetrical
aminoadamantane with a cationic group (trimethyl-ammonium)
on both sides, both cationic groups are ideally placed to make
the ion–dipole interactions with both portals. Furthermore, the
diamantane group effectively fills the cavity, these two factors
should make for an exceptionally high-affinity guest. The affinity
measured by NMR was so high to have an attomolar (1018 M)
dissociation constant.22 This is currently the highest synthetic
binding pair known. The binding constants for these guests are
shown in Fig. 4. There are two common features that these
guests share: first, the hydrophobic cores are rigid and com-
plement the CB[7] cavity; second, the ammonium groups of the
guest are ideally positioned to make ion–dipole interactions
with one or both portals. Generally, complexation events exhibit
enthalpy–entropy compensation, whereby a favourable enthalpic
contribution caused by the newly introduced functional group is
offset by an unfavourable entropic penalty. One of the many
potential bases for this phenomenon is that the newly intro-
duced non-covalent interaction that increases the enthalpy of
association also leads to an associated increase in configura-
tional restriction of the guest.23 Cyclodextrins exhibit this effect
very well as shown in the plot (Fig. 5), but when high-affinity
cucurbituril guests are added to this plot, it is clear that they
do not follow the same trend. When the binding affinities are
deconstructed into their enthalpic and entropic contributions
the reasons for the high binding affinities becomes clearer
(Fig. 4). When the neutral hydroxymethyl of the neutral ferrocene
F1 is replaced with methylammonium derivatives the enthalpy is
unperturbed (DH1 = 21 kcal mol1), but the entropy penalty
decreases (3.8–4.3 kcal mol1) and this is responsible for the
1000-fold enhancement in binding affinity; the pattern repeats
on the addition of a second methylammonium group. There are
several remarkable things here: first, F1 binds to CB[n] mainly
by hydrophobic interactions and the enthalpy contribution to
this interaction is remarkably large compared to other host–
guest systems. Secondly, there is no additional enthalpy gain by
addition of an ammonium to the guest (F2–F4), which makes

an ion–dipole interaction. Instead, the 1000-fold increase in binding
affinity per cation is driven, entropically, by the desolvation of
the portals and the guest’s cation(s).
The enthalpy-driven hydrophobic eﬀect exemplified by
cucurbiturils has been investigated in detail by the group of
Nau and has been summarized recently,24 so it will only be
discussed briefly here. The structural features of CB[n] maxi-
mize this enthalpy-dominated hydrophobic eﬀect because the
cavity is very apolar and the rigid structure means no reconfi-
guration is possible to alleviate the energetic frustration of the
cavity water molecules. The extreme enthalpically-driven hydro-
phobic eﬀect is most evident in the case of the neutral ferro-
cene derivative F1, which has a binding of 109 M1, and DH1
21 kcal mol1 which is remarkably high for a hydrophobic
interaction. For comparison, b-cyclodextrin (which has a similar
size cavity to CB[7]) binding aﬃnities rarely exceed 106 M1.
Simulations have suggested that the water molecules in the
CB[7] cavity have a lower hydrogen bond count than those in
the bulk solution. Therefore, the cavity may possess a drying
transition and host–guest complexation would therefore not have
to compete with pocket desolvation. This enthalpy-dominated
hydrophobic effect is maximal for CB[7], since CB[6] has a
smaller cavity with less potential for dewetting, and CB[8] is
larger and the simulated water molecules are closer to that of the
bulk solution; experimentally, it has been shown the DH value is
lower for CB[6] and CB[8] than it is for CB[7]. Another case where
desolvation of the cavity is enthalpically dominated is when
CB[8] forms a ternary complex. Upon complexation of the first
guest, the remaining cavity volume is much smaller and possess
a similar dewetting potential to CB[7]. As expected, the addition
of the second guest is strongly exothermic, especially when the
guest completely desolvates the cavity such as the CT-complexes
described above. Nau and co-workers have shown the lower
hydrogen bond count of the cavity water molecules is important
in these systems by demonstrating a solvent and solvent isotope
effect on binding affinity. In acetonitrile, the binding affinity is
1000-fold less, and the second guest binding is more exothermic
in water than in deuterium oxide because the hydrogen bonds
are stronger than deuterium bonds. Overall, multiple studies
have demonstrated the importance of the enthalpy-dominated
hydrophobic effect in the high-affinity binding of cucurbiturils.
The reader is directed to the reviews by Nau24 and Kim11 and
the references therein for the original studies. Furthermore, the
ion–dipole interaction seems to be almost entirely entropy-
dominated caused by the desolvation of the cation and portal
upon guest binding, which is shown by the deconstructed thermo-
dynamic data with various ferrocene derivatives.
Since the high-aﬃnity CB[7] host–guest pairs now approach –
and even surpass – the biotin streptavidin (Bt–SA) interaction,
this raises the question: can these pairs be applied as widely as
the natural pair? Soon after the high-affinity host–guest pairs
were discovered they were used as replacements for Bt–SA, and
in some cases, may eventually supplant the natural binding pair.
The advantages of the CB[7] system include that it is resistant to
enzymatic degradation and the binding may be modulated or
reversed by a competitor guest or by changing the redox state
of the guest molecule. The applications of the CB[7] system
include biomolecule immobilization, protein enrichment, adhe-
sive materials, high-affinity FRET-pairs, therapeutic activation of
nanoparticles, and regulation of biological catalysis. These appli-
cations have been reviewed recently, along with methods to
functionalize CB[7] to better harness its properties in materials
applications. We will highlight a few of these applications here;
the reader is directed to the review by Kim and the references
therein for the original works.11 The first example of such an
application was the immobilization of a protein onto a self-
assembled monolayer (SAM). An allyl-functionalized CB[7] was
attached to an allyl-terminated SAM by employing a metathesis
reaction. This CB[7] functionalized surface was able to anchor
ferrocene-labelled (‘‘ferrocenylated’’) glucose oxidase (Fc-GOx)
to the surface. Since GOx is redox active, this surface was used
as a biosensing platform for glucose. In a similar vein, Kim and
co-workers prepared a CB[7]-bead analogous to a streptavidin
(SA) functionalized bead. In the life sciences, SA-beads are often
used to capture biotinylated proteins to enrich a protein of interest.
However, SA-beads can also capture endogenously biotinylated
proteins, and release of the biotinylated proteins from the
beads, post-enrichment, requires very harsh conditions. The
CB[7] bead is able to selectively capture ferrocenylated proteins
(in this case membrane proteins) and after enrichment, the
ferrocenylated proteins are released simply by incubation with a
higher affinity guest, F4 (Fig. 6). Another interesting application
is the development of an underwater adhesion system. Velcos
works by fastening hooks into loops, and Kim and co-workers
wondered if this kind of attachment could be replicated at the
molecular level using a CB[7]-functionalized surface (the loop)
and a complimentary cationic ferrocene-functionalized surface
(the hook). When the surfaces are wet, they adhere to each
other; these can either be separated by mechanical force or by
oxidation of the ferrocene with hypochlorite solution. This work
represents the transformation of a molecular recognition event
into a macroscopic property (Fig. 7). CB[7] can also be function-
alized for solution-based applications, for example, Kim and
co-workers have prepared a Cy3-functionalized CB[7] and used
this to form a high-affinity FRET-pair with a Cy5-functionlized
adamantane. This pair was used in a vesicle mixing assay,
whereby each component was reconstituted into an individual
vesicle, and when these vesicles were mixed, a FRET-signal was
observed. The most interesting finding from this work was direct
observation of flickering-fusion events caused by transient opening
and closing of the pore formed between the vesicles. This work
emphasizes the power of using a simple synthetic system for
examining a complex process.
Moving to therapeutic applications Rotello and Isaacs have
used a CB[7]-based system to pacify and then activate cytotoxic
nanoparticles in response to a chemical stimulus (Fig. 8). The
cytotoxic nanoparticles were prepared by functionalizing a gold-
nanoparticle terminated with diamino-hexane. When these
nanoparticles were treated with CB[7], the CB[7] moiety caps
the amines and renders the particle non-cytotoxic, by virtue of it
becoming trapped in the endosome after uptake. Upon addi-
tion of a high-aﬃnity guest, A2, the CB[7] cap is removed since

CB[7] forms a more favourable complex with A2. This triggers
endosomal escape of the nanoparticles into the cytosol, thereby
activating the cytotoxicity. This work is significant in that it
shows that CB[7] system is robust and selective enough to be
activated in in vivo conditions and may have important applica-
tions in drug delivery. Isaacs and co-workers have demonstrated
control of biological catalysis using CB[7]. By preparing a bifunc-
tional molecule that is able to bind both CB[7] and bovine
carbonic anhydrase (BCA), a supramolecular switch was pre-
pared. The molecule binds to BCA, thereby inhibiting its catalytic
activity, but upon addition of CB[7] the extra steric bulk causes
the inhibitor to dissociate and reactivates the catalytic activity.
The process can be reversed by addition of trimethylsilyl-
methylammonium, a moderate-to-high aﬃnity guest for CB[7]
(Ka B 109 M1) that causes the release of the two-faced molecule,
which in turn re-inhibits the BCA.
The signature high-aﬃnity binding of the CB[n] family is in
large part a result of CB[n]’s poor interactions with water. The
narrower portal of CBs relative to cyclodextrins may make their
pockets more inhospitable to water because each water molecule
encapsulated must accept a lower H-bond count than it would in
the bulk solution; the filling of the cavity with a hydrophobic guest
is therefore very exothermic. The polar portals are well solvated in
water and desolvation of the portal (and a cationic guest) by
making an ion–dipole interaction between host and guest is very
entropically favourable, leading to a 1000-fold increase in binding
in some cases.
These unusual thermodynamic eﬀects are particularly apparent
in CB[7], but similar high-aﬃnity binding is also apparent in
CB[8] systems. The addition of a second guest in the formation
of a CB[8] stabilized-CT-complex is also subject to an enthalpy-
dominated hydrophobic eﬀect. Not only does CB[8] form stable
assemblies but they can also be switchable, for example by redox
chemistry, and this has been exploited as a tool to prepare
stimuli-responsive (bio)interfaces. The exceptional stability, bio-
compatibility, and ease of handling means that the CB[7] system
may compliment – or even supplant – Bt–SA for some applications.

Recent progress in the field suggests that high-affinity binding
pairs are making the transition from basic research into impor-
tant applications.
Pillar[n]arenes
Preamble
Pillar[n]arenes are a family of pillar-shaped or cylindrical cyclic
hosts possessing aromatic walls (Fig. 9).25–30
Similar to the calix[n]arenes, the repeating units of pillar[n]-
arenes are phenolic moieties; however, in pillar[n]arenes, the
repeating units are connected by methylene bridges at their
2- and 5-positions (i.e., in the para-positions), whereas the repeating
units in calix[n]arenes are linked by methylene bridges at their
2- and 6-positions (meta-positions). It is this diﬀerence that leads
to pillar[n]arenes possessing pockets that are open at both
ends, i.e., they are of cylindrical form in contrast to the conical
calixarenes. Inspired by the highly symmetrical pillars that
constitute the Parthenon in Athens (Fig. 9b), in 2008 Ogoshi
named these new macrocyclic hosts ‘‘pillar[n]arenes’’.25 The
pillar-shaped structure has a large influence on the physical
properties of pillar[n]arenes. One important feature is their host–
guest properties; pillar[n]arene units are constructed from electron-
rich (donating) 1,4-dialkoxy-benzenes, which gives the cavity an
affinity for electron-deficient guests. Furthermore, the cylindrical
structure very efficiently enhances the p-electron density in the
cavity (Fig. 9c). In contrast, the p-electron density enhancement is
not efficient in the cavity of calix[n]arenes because the calix-shaped
structures are not the ideal platform for this enhancement. The
electron-rich cavity of pillar[n]arenes means that they prefer to bind
molecules with cationic moieties, such as pyridinium, viologen and
ammonium moieties. However, Li and co-workers discovered very
strong complexation between simple alkylated pillar[5]arenes and
neutral linear molecules with electron-withdrawing groups at
the termini. The association constants for these systems were in
the vicinity of 104 M1, which indicates a surprisingly efficient
host–guest interaction, particularly in organic media. Among
various hosts, the cucurbit[n]urils form some of the strongest
complexes, but these complexes are formed not in organic, but
in aqueous media.
Pillar[n]arenes consist of hydrophobic cores of aromatic
and methylene bridges and have substituents on both rims.
An important advantage of pillar[n]arene chemistry is that the
core pillar[n]arene macrocyclic structure is easy to construct.
Numerous synthetic pathways have been investigated for the
preparation of pillar[n]arenes, and a simple and easy pathway is
the reaction of 1,4-dialkoxybenzene with paraformaldehyde and
an appropriate acid. The solvents used for the reaction play a
major role in determining the number of repeating units (Fig. 9a).
Cyclic pentamers pillar[5]arenes are prepared in high yields when
1,2-dichloroethane is used as the solvent. 1,2-Dichloroethane is a
linear molecule with electron-with-drawing chlorine moieties at
both ends, and thus acts as a template solvent in the formation
of pillar[5]arenes. In contrast, mixtures of larger pillar[n]arene
homologues and linear oligomers are obtained when chloro-
form is used as the solvent. Unlike 1,2-dichloroethane, chloro-
form does not act as a template for pillar[5]arenes because it
has three chlorine moieties, which does not fit to this particular
pillar[n]arene homologues. The bulky solvent chlorocyclohexane
is one of several good template solvents for the synthesis of
pillar[6]arenes because the cavity size of pillar[6]arenes (ca. 6.7 Å)
is larger than that of pillar[5]arenes (ca. 4.7 Å), and fits to the
bulky solvent chlorocyclohexane. An important advantage of
pillar[n]arenes compared with other host molecules is their
versatile functionality.28 The alkoxy substituents on both rims
of pillar[n]arenes can be readily converted to reactive moieties
such as phenol, bromide, azide and alkyne moieties (Fig. 9a).
Substrates with reactive phenolic moieties can be synthesised by
deprotection of the alkoxy substituents of pre-formed pillar[n]arenes.
Pillar[n]arenes bearing bromide and alkyne moieties are acces-
sible by cyclisation of the corresponding 1,4-dialkoxybenzenes
with two bromide and two alkyne moieties. Pillar[n]arenes with
azido moieties can be readily prepared by reaction of pre-formed
bromide derivatives and sodium azide. These three types of
pillar[n]arenes are useful key compounds for the preparation of
further functionalised pillar[n]arenes. Etherification is a straight-
forward pathway to functionalise pillar[n]arenes from phenol
derivatives. Cationisation and etherification can be used to
functionalise bromide-substituted pillar[n]arenes. Copper(I)-
catalysed alkyne–azide cyclisation (CuAAC) reactions between
alkyne-bearing pillar[n]arenes and monoazides or azido-
functionalised pillar[n]arenes and monoalkynes are facile and
useful methods for producing various functionalised pillar[n]arenes.
The substituents on both rims also determine the physical proper-
ties of the pillar[n]arenes, such as their solubility, and conforma-
tional and host–guest properties, because the pillar[n]arene cores
are surrounded by these functional substituents. It is therefore
possible to design various highly functionalised pillar[n]arenes
based on this versatile functionality.
Synthesis and properties of water-soluble pillar[n]arenes
Pillar[n]arenes with hydrophobic chains, such as those with simple
alkyl and phenolic substituents, are not water-soluble. Therefore,
host–guest complexation using these pillar[n]arenes is mainly
investigated in organic solvents. However, per-functionalisation is a
convenient way of altering the solubility properties of pillar[n]arenes
because their solubility depends on the substituents that surround
the pillar[n]arene core. Introducing hydrophilic moieties, such as

cationic or anionic groups onto both rims of pillar[n]arenes can
afford water-soluble pillar[n]arenes (Fig. 10). Ogoshi and coworkers
first synthesised a water-soluble pillar[5]arene by modification
with carboxylate anions on the pillar[5]arene rims (Fig. 10a).31
First, ethoxycarbonylmethoxy-substituted pillar[5]arene was syn-
thesised by etherification. Subsequent hydrolysis of the ethoxy
moieties under basic conditions afforded pillar[5]arene H1,
containing 10 carboxylate centers. The presence of 10 negative
charges makes it possible for this pillar[5]arene to act as a
cation receptor in water. For example, when H1 was mixed with
cationic viologen salt G1, namely paraquat, a 1 : 1 host–guest
complex was formed. The association constant of the complex
determined by fluorescence measurements was (8.2  1.7) 
104 M1, which is almost 70 times higher than that of the
complex formed between paraquat and a pillar[5]arene contain-
ing 10 phenolic moieties in methanol; in aqueous media, the
hydrophobic effect, electrostatic interactions between cationic
paraquat G1 and the carboxylate anions on the rims of H1,
and the charge-transfer interaction between host and guest all
combine to promote binding. Li, Jia, and co-workers investigated
the complexation behaviour of 20 amino acids with H1.32 H1
showed highly selective binding (K = ca. 103 M1) towards amino
acids such as L-arginine G2, L-lysine G3 and L-histidine G4 compared
with that towards other a-amino acids (K = ca. 20 M1). The basic
structure of amino acids contains one amino group; however,
L-lysine,
L-arginine, and
L-histidine have additional amino
groups on their side chains. Thus, the electrostatic interactions
between the negative carboxylate groups on both rims of the
pillar[5]arene and the multiple cationic ammonium groups in
these amino acids work cooperatively to selectively bind these
three amino acids.
Huang and co-workers synthesised a water-soluble cyclic
hexamer, pillar[6]arene H2, containing 12 carboxylates, using
the same approach used to synthesise host H1.33 Water-soluble
pillar[6]arene H2 formed highly stable 1 : 1 host–guest com-
plexes with paraquat G1 [K = (1.02  0.10)  108 M1]. The
binding constant of this complex is almost 1300 times higher
than the corresponding K value for the complexation between
the analogous water-soluble pillar[5]arene (H1) and G1. The high
binding affinity results from the size-matching between water-
soluble pillar[6]arene H2 and paraquat G1; the width of the
4,40-bipyridinium groups is 6.3 Å, which does not fit into the
cavity of pillar[5]arenes (ca. 4.7 Å) without deforming the host
but does fit into that of pillar[6]arenes (ca. 6.7 Å). The same
group also synthesised water-soluble pillar[n]arenes with differ-
ent cavity sizes [n = 7 (H3), 9 (H4) and 10 (H5)], and investigated
their host–guest ability towards paraquat G1. Water-soluble
pillar[7]arene H3 formed the most stable host–guest complex
with G1 [K = (2.96  0.31)  109 M1] among the water-soluble
pillar[n]arene homologues (H1–H5). The water-soluble pillar-
[n]arenes with large cavities can also form host–guest com-
plexes with large guests such as naphthalene diimide G5 and
1,10-phenanthrolinediium G6 cations.
Introduction of cationic moieties onto the pillar[n]arene rim
is another useful way of producing water-soluble pillar[n]arenes.
Huang and co-workers were the first to introduce cationic moieties
and synthesise a water-soluble pillar[5]arene (Fig. 10).34 Cyclisation
of 1,4-dialkoxybenzene containing two bromide moieties in 1,2-
dichloroethane, which is a good template solvent for the synthesis
of pillar[5]arenes, gave a pillar[5]arene containing 10 bromide
moieties. Pillar[5]arene H6, containing 10 trimethyl ammonium
groups on the upper and lower rims, was prepared by treatment
of the brominated pillar[5]arene with excess trimethylamine.
Because of the 10 ammonium cations on the pillar[5]arene rim,
cationic pillar[5]arene H6 is a good anion receptor and showed a
high aﬃnity for sodium alkyl sulfonates in water. For example,
cationic pillar[5]arene H6 formed a stable 1:1 host–guest complex
with 1-octanesulfonate G7 in water [K = (1.33  0.94)  104 M1].
Water-soluble pillar[n]arenes can also be synthesised by
modifying pillar[n]arenes with non-ionic oligo(ethylene oxide)
chains (H7 and H8, Fig. 10b). Modification of a pillar[5]arene
with long tri(ethylene oxide) chains made it fully soluble in water
at 25 1C whereas a pillar[5]arene modified with shorter ethylene
oxide chains was insoluble.
Stimuli-responsive water-soluble pillar[n]arenes
Aqueous solutions containing tri(ethylene oxide)-substituted
pillar[5]arene H7 and pillar[6]arenes H8 are homogeneous at room
temperature, became opaque on heating, and then homogeneous

again upon cooling. This indicates that tri(ethylene oxide)-
substituted pillar[5]arene and pillar[6]arene exhibit lower critical
solution temperature (LCST) behaviour,35 which can be attributed to
the combination of the hydrophilic tri(ethylene oxide) moieties and
hydrophobic pillar[5]arene core. Heat-induced de-solvation of water
molecules from the tri(ethylene oxide) chains triggers the aggrega-
tion of the hydrophobic pillar[n]arene cores. The cloud points of
tri(ethylene oxide)-substituted pillar[5]arene H7 and pillar[6]arene
H8 were 41 and 42 1C respectively; indicating that the diﬀerences
between the cyclic pentamer and hexamer structures did not aﬀect
the clouding points. As with the anionic pillar[5]arenes, tri(ethylene
oxide)-substituted pillar[5]arene H7 formed a 1 : 1 host–guest
complex with paraquat G8 [K = (4.3  0.5)  103 M1]. As the
amount of G8 was increased in this system, the clouding points of
pillar[5]arene H7 increased from 42 to 60 1C (Fig. 11a). Repulsive
forces between the complexed cations are one of the main reasons
why this increase in the clouding point occurred. Cucurbit[7]uril
CB[7] forms a very stable host–guest complex with paraquat G8
in aqueous media (K 4 105 M1); thus, CB[7] can be used as a
competitive host to dissociate the H7*G8 complex. Addition of
CB[7] to the H7*G8 complex induced the dissociation of the
complex, and this led to a decrease in the clouding points of
pillar[5]arene H7 from 60 to 47 1C. As a result, it was possible to
tune the clouding points of pillar[5]arene H7 by addition of
guest paraquat G8 and competitive host CB[7].
Azobenzene derivatives are widely used as photo-responsive
compounds. Pillar[6]arenes form stable host–guest complexes
with trans-azobenzene derivatives, but not with the cis isomers; the
latter is ill-fitting. Consequently, the photo-responsive host–guest
system composed of pillar[6]arenes and azobenzene derivatives
can be used as a photo-switch. Thus tri(ethylene oxide)-substituted
pillar[6]arene H8 formed a host–guest complex with trans-
azobenzene G9, containing two 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane
(DABCO) cations in aqueous media [Fig. 11b, K = (4.3  0.5) 
103 M1]. Complexation between azobenzene guest G9 in the
trans-form and pillar[6]arene H8 induced an increase in the
cloud points from 42 to 57 1C. The reason for this increase is
the same as that that described above for the pillar[5]arene
H7*G7 complex: electronic repulsion between the complexed
cations prevents the aggregation of pillar[6]arenes H8. The
cloud points of the complex decreased from 57 to 52 1C upon
UV irradiation; a change in the conformation of azobenzene
guest G9 from the trans- to the cis-state was induced by UV
irradiation, which triggered the dissociation of the host–guest
complex. Hence the dissociation of the complex functioned as a
switch to change the clouding point of the mixture. The cloud
point of the mixture returned to 57 1C on visible light irradia-
tion with the conversion of the cis-form of azobenzene guest G9
back to the trans-form.
Pei and co-workers synthesised pillar[5]arene H9 function-
alised with 10 ferrocene moieties using the CuAAC reaction of
an azido-functionalised pillar[5]arene and a ferrocene bearing
one alkyne group (Fig. 11c).36 This host was not soluble in
aqueous media. However, oxidation of the ferrocenyl groups
resulted in the formation of the ferrocenium cation derivative
which formed spherical vesicles in aqueous media because the
core of the pillar[5]arene and the ferrocenium cation substituents
are hydrophobic and hydrophilic respectively. Reduction of the
ferrocenium cations with glutathione (GSH) acted as a trigger
for the release of a drug encapsulated in the vesicles. This GSH-
responsive system would be an ideal drug/siRNA co-delivery
system for drug release and gene transfection in cancer cells
because the GSH concentration in cancer cells is typically higher
than that in normal cells.
Applications of water-soluble pillar[n]arenes
Pillar[n]arenes have a cylindrical structure, and can thus be used
as artificial channels for molecular transportation. Hou and
co-workers reported artificial single-molecular transmembrane
water channels using pillar[5]arenes bearing hydrazide moieties
on their side chains (Fig. 12a, H10 and H11).37 The hydrazide
units participated in intramolecular hydrogen bonding to pro-
duce the tubular structure. These tubular molecules acted as
channels for transporting water across a liquid membrane when
they were inserted into the membranes. The water transport from
outside to inside the vesicles was driven by the osmotic pressure
diﬀerence between the outside and inside of the vesicles. Thus,
the transport of water molecules caused swelling and fusion of
the vesicles. The pillar-shaped structure of pillar[n]arenes is
also useful for constructing multi-layer structures using layer-
by-layer (LbL) assembly. In most cases, polymer systems are used
in LbL assembly because multiple interaction points, which are
observed in polymer systems, are necessary for construction of

thin films using this technique. LbL assembly of molecules with
low molecular weights is generally diﬃcult and comparatively
rare because of the lack of multiple interaction points. However,
the presence of functional groups at both rims of water-soluble
cationic and anionic pillar[n]arenes allow these hosts to eﬃciently
form multilayers using LbL assembly (Fig. 13).38 First, an
inorganic substrate with anionic surface charges was immersed
in an aqueous solution of cationic pillar[5]arene H6 to intro-
duce cationic pillar[5]arenes onto the substrate by means of
anion–cation interactions. Then, the substrate was immersed
in an aqueous solution of anionic pillar[5]arene H1 to introduce
anionic pillar[5]arenes onto the cationic surface. Wang and
co-workers reported dramatic swelling of hydrogels promoted by
the complexation between anionic pillar[6]arene H2 and ferrocene
groups in a hydrogel (Fig. 14).39 When a hydrogel covalently func-
tionalised with ferrocene groups was immersed in an aqueous
solution of anionic pillar[6]arene H2, the hydrogel swelled
dramatically, with an approximately 11-fold increase in weight
compared with that in pure water constructed from the cationic
pillar[5]arenes. Multilayer films were obtained by repeating these
alternating immersion steps. This swelling was due to the forma-
tion of inclusion complexes between anionic pillar[6]arene H2
and the ferrocene groups in the hydrogel. Because anionic
pillar[6]arene H2 contains 12 carboxylate anions, this complexa-
tion generated strong electrostatic repulsion between the polymer
chains, and thus resulted in the swelling of the hydrogel.
Guest molecules can access both portals of pillar[n]arenes,
and pillar[n]arenes can thus be used as the ring component
in pseudo[2]rotaxane structures. Huang and co-workers have
reported various supramolecular assemblies, including micelles,
vesicles, and tubes, constructed from [2]pseudorotaxanes con-
sisting of water-soluble pillar[n]arenes and amphiphilic guests.40
Tubular aggregates were formed by self-assembly of amphiphilic
guest G10, which consists of a hydrophilic pyridinium salt and
hydrophobic alkyl and pyrene groups (Fig. 15). In contrast, the
water-soluble pillar[6]arene H2*G10 complex self-assembled
to form vesicles. Typically, a high membrane curvature tends to
result in nano-tubular assemblies, whereas a membrane with
a low curvature favours vesicular assemblies. In the absence
of water-soluble pillar[6]arene H2, amphiphilic guest G10 self-
assembles to form a highly ordered bilayer of pyrenyl groups
through p–p interactions, which leads to a high curvature and
the formation of tubular assemblies. In contrast, the formation

repulsion of anionic pillar[6]arene H2, and this then results in

synthesised
water-soluble
glycoclusters containing 10 sugar residues and a pillar[5]arene
core (Fig. 16a).41 The synthesis of these pillar[5]arene-based
glycoclusters was readily achieved by a CuAAC reaction between
an alkyne-functionalised pillar[5]arene and acetylated sugar
residues bearing one azide moiety. Deprotection of the acetylate
ester moieties gave the water-soluble glycoclusters. The authors
then investigated multivalent binding of the glycoclusters to
pathogenic bacterial lectins. Compared with a reference mono-
valent sugar residue, the glycoclusters showed superior binding
to lectins due to the multivalent bonding. With an appropriate
length spacer between the sugar residues and the pillar[5]arene
core, the glycoclusters showed higher aﬃnity to lectins. The
same group also synthesised hetero-glycoclusters containing
two diﬀerent sugar residues (e.g., galactoses and fucoses) based
on a [2]rotaxane scaﬀold.42 To achieve this, one sugar residue
was used as a stopper and a [2]rotaxane was produced using a
CuAAC reaction. Then, another CuAAC reaction between the azide-

Water-soluble deep-cavity cavitands
Preamble
The definition of deep-cavity cavitands used here are resorcin-
[4]arene-based hosts where an additional second row of (normally
aromatic) rings has been added to the resorcinarene. The second
row – added either as a bridge between adjacent resorcinol
hydroxyl groups or to the 2-position of the resorcinol rings
themselves – deepens the binding pocket significantly. Examples
of the latter were first to appear in the literature, but extending
the cavity of these hosts using suitable bridging moieties has
proven to be the most popular.
The gross structural diﬀerence between deep-cavity cavitands
and cucurbiturils or pillarenes is that cavitands are bowl-shaped
rather than toroidal; they are closed at one end. This has
manifold implications. For example, solvation of the pocket is
harder, and hence the pocket can be viewed as more hydro-
phobic. Relatedly, replacing water in a pocket with a guest via
an associative (SN2-like) mechanism is diﬃcult with only one
portal in or out; dissociative (SN1-like) mechanisms dominate.
Moreover, the Cnv symmetry and more encompassing struc-
tures of cavitands lead to considerable control of guest orienta-
tion and conformation (binding motif). As we will discuss, this
control has considerable ramifications regarding the applications
of cavitands. Finally, on the topic of general shape, it is also
important to note that by careful design, cavitands have also proven
adept at undergoing self-assembly to form all-encapsulating

containers; containers that take all of the aforementioned
points to the extreme.
Two examples of the first water soluble deep-cavity cavitands
are 1 and 2 (Fig. 17) that are described in more detail in these
reviews.43,44 Cavitand 1 reported by the Reinhoudt group possesses
four pyridinium groups at the upper rim. Cavitands with longer
pendent R groups proved to be more water-soluble because of
eﬃcient aggregation. The non-aggregating cavitand with methyl
pendent groups (or feet) was shown to form weak, fast exchanging
1:1 complexes with small aromatic guests. A similar strategy was
used to give the ethylene-bridged host 2 reported by Diederich.
With a more preorganized cavity this host formed 1:2 host–guest
complexes in pure water and 1:1 host–guest complexes in buffer.
Guests such as adenosine triphosphate that associated via electro-
static interactions and the hydrophobic effect were found to bind
strongly to 2.
Deep-cavity cavitands via bridging strategies
Extending the cavity walls of resorcinarenes using the bridges
between resorcinol moieties has to date proven to be more
popular. Within this approach two general classes of cavitands
have emerged: velcrands and benzal-bridged cavitands.43,45,46
The two most studied water-soluble velcrands are those with
benzimidazoles (3) and benzimidazolones (4) bridges. A key
structure feature of velcrands is that they exist as an equili-
brium mixture of two conformations: a flattened (C2v) kite form
that has a strong predisposition to dimerize in solution, and
a deeper concave (C4v) vase form capable of binding guests.
This equilibrium between the vase and kite forms is largely
controlled by the precise nature of the host and solvent, and
if present, the nature of the guest. In many of the studies in water
these velcrands exist as a kite-form complex containing one
strongly binding tetrahydrofuran molecule; a residual solvent
molecule from the synthesis of the host.
In 2004, the Gibb group reported the first water-soluble benzal
bridged type cavitand 5a (Fig. 17).45 The so-called ‘‘octa-acid’’
(OA) 5a, is sparingly soluble at neutral aqueous solution, but
highly soluble and monomeric at pH 4 7. This host possesses a
B0.8 nm wide  B0.8 nm deep hydrophobic pocket that, like a
velcrand is closed oﬀat the base, but is more preorganized. The
evenly spread charges on the surface of this host bestow it with
excellent behaviour in aqueous solution. Other variations on this
general structure have subsequently been reported. For example,
tetra-endo-methyl octa acid (TEMOA) 5b possesses a slightly
diﬀerently shaped hydrophobic pocket. Moreover, cationic
water-soluble cavitands such as 5c and 5d have also been
reported, as have neutral hosts that utilize dendritic or polymeric
coats to attain water-solubility.45 To date these types of cavitands
have been shown to form 1 : 1 complexes, as well as undergo self-
assembly to form a range of complexes: 2 : 1, 2 : 2, 4 : 2 and 6 : 3.
1 : 1 host–guest complexes: controlling guest reactivity
The Cnv symmetry of cavitands can lead to specific bound guest
orientations. Using 1H-NMR the Gibb group observed this in the
1 : 1 complexes between aliphatic carboxylates and OA 5a; the
guests buried their hydrophobic tails in the pocket of 5a, and
placed their polar carboxylate head group exposed to the aqueous
medium.45 This additional charged group on the surface of the
complex suppresses any host assembly (vide infra). Isothermal
Titration Calorimetry (ITC) showed that the aﬃnity between OA
and these guests were generally stronger than the corresponding
aﬃnities with similarly sized b-cyclodextrin. For example, the
respective aﬃnities between OA and b-cyclodextrin with adamantane
carboxylate are Ka = 1.14  106 and 1.05  105 M1.45 This is
tentatively ascribed to a combination of the more encapsulating
pocket of OA 5a being relatively poorly hydrated, and it being
able to form more non-covalent contacts with the guest. These
types of complexes with amphiphiles have proven useful in
predictive blind challenges for computational chemist testing
their modelling strategies.47
Even hydrated anions such as I or ClO4
 have an aﬃnity
with OA 5a, and such complexation events have been shown to
attenuate the binding of non-polar guests by a simple competi-
tion mechanism. Moreover, this competition has been shown to
replicate the salting-in phenomenon of the Hofmeister eﬀect.48
This relatively strong anion aﬃnity can again be ascribed to the
true concavity of 5a.
Interestingly, although a guest dissociative (SN1-like) mecha-
nism is assumed to operate with these 1 : 1 complexes, a diﬀerent
mechanism seems to be in operation when the guest being
replaced is water. Thus, in silico studies have demonstrated that
if a hydrophobic guest approaches within 3–4 Å of the pocket
portal of 5a it disrupts stabilizing hydrogen bonds between
bound and bulk water.49 At a longer distance this initially leads
to fluctuations in the water density in the pocket, but as the guest
approaches to B3 Å it ultimately leads to complete dehydration
of the binding site. Thus water displacement by a guest follows a
triggered dissociation mechanism.
Velcrand 3 has been shown to form 1 : 1 complexes with
tetraalkylammonium salts.46 In this case the guest is again

aligned in one specific orientation; with the larger alkyl group
buried and the ammonium group at the portal of the host where
it can interact with water and the carboxylates of the host.
The driving force of the hydrophobic eﬀect, combined with
the fact that these hosts only have one portal, means that it
is possible to compress flexible guests into unnaturally small
spaces.43,46 Consider for example how host 3 binds two surfac-
tants, sodium dodecylsulfate and dodecyl phosphatidylcholine,
in a 1 : 1 manner. Free in non-aqueous media, alkyl chains favor
extended (anti) conformations to minimize steric interactions
and maximize surface area. Such an extended conformation is
energetically unfavorable in water, and consequently when
presented with the cavity of 3 the alkyl groups of these guests
compact themselves so as to minimize their exposure to bulk
water and maximize their contacts with the host. In short, they
coil into helices inside the cavity (Fig. 18).
The truly concave nature of deep-cavity cavitands can also
induce guests to preferentially adopt U- or J-shaped conforma-
tions or motifs. In a recent example, N-methylated benzimid-
azolones bridged cavitand 4b was shown to bind amphiphilic
guests such as n-alcohols in a folded confirmation, where the
hydroxyl group is located at the rim or portal and the hydro-
phobic chains are deeply buried into the pocket. For guest such as
C8 and C9, the chain is extended, but with longer guests (greater
than C10) the chain forms a reverse turn (Fig. 19). Consequently,
the longest guests adopt J-shaped motifs anchored as such by
the preference of the polar head group to remain solvated.46
In contrast, all examples of a,o-diol guest examined were shown
to bind in folded, U-shaped motifs.
The observation that guests can be folded into conforma-
tions whereby the termini are pushed closely together raises the
prospect of being able to bring about controlled macrocyclization
processes. Two examples with host 4a include the enhanced
cyclization of o-amino acids to form lactams, and the forma-
tion of di-lactams.50 In the latter example, long-chain diamines
were first complexed to 4a before the addition of the di-N-
hydroxysuccinimide ester of succinic acid resulted in the rapid
formation of the corresponding 17- to 25-membered dilactams
(Fig. 20).
Very recently, host 4b was also shown to engender unusual
reactions of bound guests. For example, bound diesters were
shown to form 1 : 1 complexes in which the guest rapidly
alternatives between two identical J-shaped conformations via
a ‘‘yo-yo’’ motion (Fig. 21).51 Under acidic conditions, one ester
group of the guest is hydrolyzed B10 times faster than in bulk
solution, i.e., the host catalyzes hydrolysis, and this results in
the guest adopting a fixed motif with the carboxylic acid group
at the head of the J-motif and the remaining ester at the short

tail of the motif buried in the binding pocket. As a result, the
hydrolysis of the second ester is attenuated 2–4 times. Hydrolysis
under basic conditions (saponification) gave much better yields
of monoester. Evidently, the anchoring of the carboxylate at
the head of the J-motif and exposed to bulk solution is much
stronger than the anchoring properties of the carboxylate formed
under acidic conditions. Other recent examples of controlling guest
reactivity with 4b include biasing Staudinger reduction of a,o-
diazides, and converting a,o-diisocyanates to aminoisocyanates.51
Encapsulation and self-assembly
The unusual guest encompassing properties of bowl-shaped
hosts can be taken one step further by self-assembly. Thus,
dimerization of these hosts leads to a completely integral inner
space for total guest encapsulation. As we describe, the dry, yocto-
liter inner spaces of such containers – or put another way the
compartmentalization brought about by such supramolecular
hosts – have considerable potential to control unique reactions
or engender novel separation protocols.
Host OA (5a) and its tetra-endo-methyl derivative TEMOA (5b)
assemble via the hydrophobic eﬀect. As a result, even though the
encapsulation complexes are held together by relatively weak
interactions (aromatic stacking between the hosts and C–H  p
interactions between the hosts and guest or guests) binding is
strong. For example, of the steroids first investigated binding
to the dimer of 5a, (+)-dehydroisoandrosterone was shown by
1H-NMR to have a minimum association constant 1  108 M1.45
This indirect driving of assembly rooted in the cohesive forces
between water molecules means that even small alkanes form very
stable 2 :2 host–guest complexes with 5a.52 With larger alkanes
(C11–C14) helical motifs are observed for the bond guest, whilst
for even still larger guests (C18–C23) U-shape motifs have been
identified by 1H-NMR (Fig. 22). For this dimer host the limit for
n-alkane guest binding is approximately C24–C26, at which point
the center of the guest begins to separate the two hemispheres of
the capsule.
With four endo-methyl groups on the top of the cavitand,
TMEOA 5b has a slightly deeper cavity but a narrower portal
compared to OA 5a. This leads to very diﬀerent assembly and
complexation profiles. For example, the complexes between 5b
and the series of n-alkane guests C1 through C14 are: 1 : 1 for C1,
C2, C7 and C8, 2 : 2 for C5, and 2 : 1 for C9–C14. Guests C3, C4
and C6 form mixtures of 1 : 1 and 2 : 2 complexes. These host–
guest systems therefore function as a nine-input, one-output
logic gate.53 Interestingly, this non-monotonic assembly profile
is reflected in the predisposition of TEMOA 5b to form hetero-
host guest encapsulation complexes with OA 5a (5a5bguest).45
Octa-acid host 5a has only been observed to form a dimeric
container. However, this is not the case with TEMOA 5b. The
aforementioned complex assembly profile of 5b is in fact a
reflection of its reduced propensity to dimerize; the methyl
groups (R0 in Fig. 17) sterically interfere in the dimerization
interface between the two hosts. However, they do not interfere
in the assembly of larger assemblies. Thus, with n-alkane chains
C17–C20 5b forms mono-dispersed, pseudo Td (D2d) 4 : 2 host–
guest complexes, whilst for C24–C26 guests nonary 6 : 3 host–
guest complexes with overall Oh symmetry are formed (Fig. 23).45
Although 1H-NMR did not reveal the precise binding motifs of
the bound guests in these complexes, these are the most capacious
hosts assembled in water, respectively defining 1400–1500 and
3200–3700 Å3.
Recently, the Rebek group has extended their study of capsular
complexes to the aqueous phase. For example, host 4a has been
shown to undergo self-assembly in water around a range of
stilbenes, paraquats, and related derivatives.46
Separations with capsules
Capsule 5a2 has been used to bring about both physical separa-
tions and kinetic resolutions. An example of the former is shown
in Fig. 24.54 Briefly, the addition of a mixture of hydrocarbon
gases to the head-space above a solution of the host leads to the
selective sequestration of the strongest binding alkane. The well-
defined structure of the supramolecular host leads to selectivity
at the methylene group level. Thus, with a mixture of propane
and butane only two molecules of the later are sequestered
within the host leaving an enriched or pure sample of propane
in the head-space.

Capsule 5a2 can also be used to bring about the kinetic
resolution of constitutional isomeric of esters by selective protec-
tion (Fig. 25).55 In the absence of the host, the selected C11H22O2
guests undergo saponification at rates commensurate with the
size of their alkoxy group. However, in the presence of 5a2 these
intrinsic hydrolyses were strongly modulated by the relative
aﬃnity each ester has for the capsule. As shown in Fig. 25,
when methyl decanoate and ethyl nonanoate are saponified in
the presence of 5a only 18% of the former is hydrolyzed in the
time it takes to hydrolyze all of the latter. A detailed analysis
involving Ka and rate determinations allowed a Michaelis–Menton
type model to be built that fitted the observed resolutions. Briefly,
the more strongly bound ester was protected within the capsule
which greatly retarded its hydrolysis relative to the weaker binding
competitor.
Reactions in capsules
Many examples of how the capsule formed by 5a controls the
photochemistry and photophysics of encapsulated guests have
been reported.56 One interesting study involved the comparison
of a series of a-(n-alkyl)-dibenzyl ketones (DBKs). All DBK guests
formed 2:1 host/guest complexes with the dimer of OA 5a, but
within the series three diﬀerent packing motifs were formed
depending on the length of the side chain. For the small R groups
(R = Me, Et, n-propyl), each phenyl ring of the guest occupied the
polar regions of the host while the R group filled the equatorial
region (Fig. 26 illustrates this with the methyl guest). For mid-sized
R groups (R = n-butyl, n-pentyl and n-hexyl) it was found that one
phenyl ring and the R group occupied the polar regions of the host
and the proximal phenyl ring (red in Fig. 26) filled the equatorial
region. Finally, in the case of the largest R groups (R = n-heptyl and
n-octyl), the guest packed the cavity such that the distal phenyl ring
(blue in Fig. 26) occupies the equatorial region of the capsule. Each
of these motifs led to diﬀerent photochemical outcomes, with the
smaller or mid-sized alkyl chains lead to Norrish type I products
and the long alkyl chains lead to Norrish type II products. Many of
the rearrangement products, e.g. the benzyl-phenylketones, are not
seen in solution. Instead they arose through exceedingly strong
cage eﬀects and the non-covalent interactions between the host
and the intermediate radicals. Another example is the photo-
chemical selective oxidation of olefins by singlet oxygen within the
5a2 capsule.56 Normally, the addition of singlet oxygen to the double
bond of alkenes possessing multiple allylic positions leads to a
mixture of allylic hydro-peroxides. However, 1-methyl cyclohexenes
formed a 2:2 host–guest complex in which the guests adopt specific
orientations with the methyl group of each anchored into one pole
of the capsule. This leaves only the C-3 position accessible via partial
opening of the capsule. With singlet oxygen generated from the
irradiation of dimethyl benzyl (DMB) encapsulated in the same
type of capsule, and ‘‘communication’’ between the two cap-
sular complexes, allylic substrates were selectively oxidized in
up to 95% yield (Fig. 27).
Conclusions
This tutorial review has highlighted select, preeminent examples
from the growing fields of cucurbiturils, pillarenes and cavitands.
Studies with these hosts are revealing new and unusual properties
arising from their ability to eﬃciently sequester guest molecules
from the surrounding aqueous solution. At the same time, these
studies are revealing details about the links between solvation of
small spaces and the hydrophobic eﬀect, and how anion aﬃnity
for non-polar surfaces is implicated in the Hofmeister eﬀect. On
both fronts, there is evidently much to explore and much to do;
further studies can be expected to demonstrate a further broaden-
ing of the range of properties demonstrated by these hosts, and
more details concerning the dissolution of solutes in water.

of singlet oxygen into the alkene-containing capsule and regioselective
oxidation.
