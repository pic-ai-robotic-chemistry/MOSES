1. INTRODUCTION
The product of the condensation reaction between glycoluril
and formaldehyde was first reported in a thesis by Eberhard
Meyer in 19041 and then published by Behrend and co-workers
in 1905;2 however, it was not until 1981 that a product was
successfully crystallized from the reaction: a macrocycle
consisting of 6 glycoluril units bound together by 12 methylene
bridges (see Figure 1).3 The macrocycle was named
cucurbituril, given its resemblance to a pumpkin (which
belongs to the cucurbitaceae family), yet often abbreviated as
CB[6], highlighting the 6 glycoluril building blocks that
constitute the macrocycle.
During the 1980s and 1990s, interest in crystal engineering
and noncovalent interactions saw the popularity of cucurbituril
increase due to its ability to facilitate noncovalent binding. This
is made possible via the formation of complexes with cations
through interactions with the carbonyl-lined portals of CB[6],
along with its ability to internalize alkyl chains within its
hydrophobic cavity. Between 2000 and 2002, Kim4 and Day5,6
modified the initial reaction conditions of Meyer and Behrend
to synthesize a variety of glycoluril-based cucurbituril macrocycles. The new additions to the cucurbituril family were
named cucurbit[5]uril, cucurbit[7]uril, cucurbit[8]uril, and
cucurbit[10]uril in light of them containing 5, 7, 8, or 10
glycoluril units, respectively. These discoveries enhanced the
applicability of cucurbiturils, as the bigger cavity size of the
larger CBs enables them to form 1:1 binary complexes (CB[7])
and even 1:1:1 heteroternary complexes (CB[8], see Figure 2)
with aromatic compounds. A variety of CB[n] homologues
have been discovered since the work of Kim and Day, including
functionalized CB[n],7−9 nor-seco-CB[10],10 inverted CB[n],11
and many others.
CB[5]−CB[8] have found a variety of uses given their ability
to form binary and ternary host−guest complexes and therefore
impacted a wide variety of scientific research areas. Several
previous reviews have specifically highlighted the synthesis,
functionalization, and host−guest binding properties of CB-
[n]12−17 and their applications in drug delivery,18 fluorescence
spectroscopy,19 catalysis,20 and nanotechnology.21,22 More
recently, the contribution of CB[n] in self-assembly and
engineering of nanomaterials has also received attention,23
where the role of CB[n] as a capping agent to stabilize metallic
nanoparticles has been emphasized. The diversity of these
reviews are evidence of the far-reaching impact cucurbit[n]urils
have had in just the past three decades.
With the vast majority of applications of CB relying on its
versatility in forming dynamic complexes with a variety of
chemical species, research efforts by the cucurbit[n]uril
community continue to be directed toward identifying and
characterizing suitable guest molecules. Indeed, designing
functional systems containing CB[n] would not be possible
without the knowledge of binding strengths and the kinetics of
complexation and decomplexation of the host molecule with
the guests of interest. While the interactions of the macrocyclic
host family have been reported widely, the characterization
techniques and conditions under which these are reported have
not been comprehensively reviewed. Moreover, the plethora of
CB[n] guest species and their binding constants have not been
tabulated and made available in one place. The present review
highlights the latest developments in the understanding and
applications of the molecular recognition properties of CB[n],
with particular emphasis on materials design.
In this review, we cover the vast areas of scientific research
upon which CB[n]s have impacted, with a focus on the guest
recognition properties of CB[n], largely but not wholly
concerning of their utilization in solution phase where most
applications have arisen. To understand the binding properties
of CB[n], a general overview of the thermodynamics of CB[n] binding is first discussed, followed by an individual analysis of
the specific binding properties of CB[5]−CB[8]. Looking
toward the application of CB[n] complexation, the areas of gas
encapsulation, CB[n]s on surfaces, CB[n]-mediated supramolecular polymers, molecular recognition in 3D supramolecular networks, CB[n] catalysis and reaction templating,
and CB[n] recognition in biological systems will each be
discussed in turn.
Additionally, this review provides the reader with a
comprehensive guide to the guest molecules that have been
studied with CB[5,6,7,8]. The tables cover first guests that have
been demonstrated to bind with cucurbiturils and include the
binding constants (log K) for each interaction, along with the
conditions in which the binding parameters have been reported.
For the case of CB[8], tables covering the binding constants for
1:1, 1:2, and 1:1:1 complexes have been included (see Figure
2). The binding constants, as well as the conditions under
which the binding constants are measured, have been
emphasized with the hope that this will encourage the
development of new applications for known guest molecules
as well as lead to the realization of new guest species for CB[n]
host−guest complexes.


2. THERMODYNAMICS OF CB[n]−GUEST BINDING
Cucurbit[n]urils consist of n glycoluril molecules that are
bound in a ring-like arrangement via methylene bridges. This
arrangement of the glycoluril subunits is key to understanding
the binding and encapsulation properties of CBs, as the number
of repeat units defines the portal size and cavity volume and the
alignment of the glycoluril units results in a hydrophobic cavity
with carbonyl-lined portals. Understanding these aspects of
CB[n] macrocycles can enable researchers to design guest
species for high-affinity binding, tailored toward specific
applications. Each of these aspects will now be considered.
The dipolar nature of the carbonyl-fringed portals of CB[n]s
make the portals highly attractive for cation binding through
the ion−dipole effect. Figure 3 shows the electrostatic potential
for CB[5]−CB[8], which highlights the strength of the
negative charge associated with the portals of CB. Indeed, the
first reports of CB[n] binding involved metal cations acting as
“lids” bound to the portals of CB.24 Alkali metals,24,25 alkaline
earth metals,26−28 transition metals,28−30 lanthanides and
actinides,28,31−33 as well as ammonium and imidazolium
ions34 have been shown to bind to CB portals and are often
required to enhance the solubility of the less water-soluble CBs.
The portals have also been suggested to provide a constrictive
steric barrier toward binding, enhancing the persistence of
CB[n] complexes.35 The coordination chemistry of CB[n]s has
been recently reviewed36 and thus will not be discussed any
further here.
While the portals of CB[n]s are highly electronegative, the
cavities of the macrocycle are encompassed by the fused rings
of the glycoluril subunits, which leave no functional groups or
electron pairs accessible to the inner cavity. Thus, the inner
cavity of CB[n]s are remarkably hydrophobic and show a
preference toward the encapsulation of hydrophobic compounds. Hence, alkylated ammonium and imidazolium ions
bind to CB[n]s such that the cation remains at the portal
region, while the alkyl chains become encapsulated within the
CB cavity given its inherent hydrophobicity.37,38 It should not
be surprising then to discover that compounds with high
binding constants toward CB[n]s tend to be dicationic species
where the cations are separated by an organic/hydrophobic
region. Examples of such strong binders for CB[6], CB[7], and
CB[8] include cadaverine, methylviologen, and aminoadamantane, respectively, with the size of the hydrophobic
region being tailored for the specific volume of each CB cavity.
Another facet to the binding of guest species within CB[n]
cavities is how well a guest physically fits within the cavity. A
good predictor of CB[n] complex binding comes from the
assessment of whether the inner cavity of the host and the
shape of the guest display good complementarity. The cavity
volumes of CB[5]−CB[8] are shown in Table 1 and range
from 82 Å3 for CB[5] to 479 Å3 for CB[8].24 As a result of its
small size, CB[5] is mostly suitable for the encapsulation of
gases (discussed in section 7), whereas CB[6] can bind alkyl
chains, CB[7] can accommodate small aromatic compounds,
and CB[8] can simultaneously complex with two molecules, suggesting that guest size is an important factor when
considering CB[n]:guest complexes. This steric aspect of
molecular host−guest recognition has been quantified by
Mecozzi and co-workers40 and termed the packing coefficient.
Packing coefficients are defined as the ratio of guest volume to
the volume of the host cavity, and this principle has been
successfully applied to predict complexation between CB[5]
and CB[8] with appropriate guest compounds.41
The distinct advantage of employing CB[n]s in host−guest
molecular recognition is that complexes involving CB[n] can be
formed in water with high binding affinity. Typically, aqueous
environments cause a drop in host−guest affinity, compared to
organic solvents, as water can compete strongly for hydrogen
bonds and efficiently solvate charged species. CB[n]s overcome
this issue via the presence of high-energy water, which is
present in the CB[n] cavity and supplies a driving force for
guest complexation.42−44 The release of high-energy water and
its role in macrocycle complex formation has been
comprehensively reviewed (Figure 4).45
All cavities larger than a critical size contain water molecules,
for entropic reasons, even if the breaking of hydrogen bonds is
necessary. Such water molecules experience a reduced number
of hydrogen bonds compared to bulk water and are thus of high
energy. For the case of CB[n]s, the binding of a guest molecule
releases the energetically frustrated water molecules, which
lowers the energy of the system, providing an enthalphic and
entropic gain in favor of complex formation. This hydrophobic
effect has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations,43
where it was determined that host−guest affinity is higher for
cases where all water molecules are removed from the cavity
(related to the packing coefficient) and where the encapsulated
water is of high energy. CB[7] was shown to result in the
largest energy gain from water expulsion of the whole CB[n]
family, as it contains more water molecules than CB[5] and
CB[6], and has higher energy water molecules encapsulated
than CB[8], as the cavity size of CB[8] allows for encapsulated
water to be structurally organized in a manner more closely
resembling bulk water.
Ion−dipole binding, host−guest packing coefficients, and
hydrophobic effects all need to be taken into account when
considering guest molecules for CB[n] complexing with high
binding affinity. The tables in this review provide an extensive
list of the guest species for CB[5]−CB[8] along with their
binding constants (log K). This material should provide the
reader with an understanding of the principles behind CB[n]
complex formation in addition to a comparative list of CB[n]
guests.


3. SPECIFIC BINDING PROPERTIES OF CB[5]
CB[5] is the smallest macrocycle in the cucurbit[n]uril family.
With its synthesis and isolation first reported by Kim and coworkers in 2000, it has a portal diameter of 2.4 Å and a cavity
volume of 82 Å3 (which is under one-half the volume of
CB[6]).4 As a result of its small cavity size, CB[5] has found
limited use in the encapsulation of guest molecules compared
to the larger homologues; however, the carbonyl groups of the
glycoluril subunits allow for the binding of cationic species to
the portals of CB[5].29,34,46 It has been shown that protons can
bind to the portals of CB[n]s, and indeed, this is the
mechanism by which the more insoluble CBs can be dissolved
through the use of aqueous acidic media.34 CB[5] and
decamethyl−CB[5] have also been shown to form portal
complexes with alkali, alkaline earth, and ammonium cations,46
in addition to hexamethylenetetramine, which can act as a lid
on the carbonyl portals of CB[5].47 CB[5] and decamethyl−
CB[5] form very weak complexes with α, β, and γ forms of
cyclodextrin, with binding constants ranging between log K =
0.74 and 1.34.48 CB[5] also exhibits binding with multicharged
cations including Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Cr2+, and
Fe2+.29
CB[5] shares similar portal binding properties with larger
members of the cucurbituril family; however, its small internal
cavity limits its ability to support host−guest complex
formation. Even though CB[5] is not big enough to incorporate
large molecules into its cavity, its small size gives rise to its
niche: the encapsulation of gaseous molecules. Decamethyl−
CB[5] has been demonstrated to encapsulate small gaseous
species in both aqueous environments and in solid form. Gases
such as N2, O2, Ar, N2O, CO, and CO2 have been shown to be
encapsulated in both powdered and aqueous decamethyl−
CB[5], while He, Ne, H2, Kr, Xe, and CH4 could only be
encapsulated in an aqueous environment, with Kr, Xe, and CH4
requiring heating of the sample to assist encapsulation.49 A full
discussion of the gas sorption properties of cucurbit[n]urils is
offered in section 7.


4. SPECIFIC BINDING PROPERTIES OF CB[6]
CB[6] is the most abundant homologue, and with a portal
diameter of 3.9 Å, it is commonly known to form stable
complexes with aliphatic amines. The insolubility of CB[6] in
organic solvents and sparing solubility in water has, however,
had a limiting impact on its applications in its unmodified form.
This is evident in the different solvent conditions in which the
binding of CB[6] complexes are often reported. For example,
Mock and co-workers first studied the complexation of a variety
of alkyl- and aryl-substituted alkylammonium and alkyldiammonium ions in aqueous formic acid.50 The results highlighted
the size and shape complementarity exhibited by CB[6]
contributing to its selective binding properties. It is well
established that the stability of these complexes is a result of
strong interactions between the positively charged protonated
amines and the six electronegative carbonyl moieties at the
portals. The hydrophobic nature of the methylene groups
favors their positioning inside the cavity of the CB[6] where
the solvent water molecules are excluded, adding to further
stabilization of the complexes. Therefore, the most stable
complex is formed for an optimal length of the aliphatic chain
such that the amine groups are positioned in close proximity to
the portal groups. As a result, CB[6] shows strongest binding to
pentano- and hexano-bridged α,ω-diammonium functionalities. The binding properties of CB[6] with imidazolium-based
guests have also been investigated widely37,38,51 and used in the
synthesis of monofunctionalized CB[6]8 as well as in the
isolation of CB[n] homologues, Tables 2−4.52
The importance of the surroundings of the complex,
however, has a major impact on the strength of the resulting
complex as demonstrated by Lee and co-workers.53 In this
correlation study of the binding behavior of diammonium
guests between the solution phase (50% HCOOH, ITC) and
the gas phase (ESI-MS) it is shown that while a correlation
exists between the two phases, the stabilities of the complexes
are different. They suggest that this contrast is a result of an
additional role played by the H bonding with water molecules
in the solution phase, while only ion−dipole interactions
predominantly exist in the gas phase. In the gas phase, the guest
has to undergo a structural distortion in order to maximize
ion−dipole interactions with the portal. The distortion is not
needed in water because it is compensated in solution through
hydrogen bonding with water.
The high binding affinities of CB[6] toward aliphatic amines
compared to aromatic groups have led to various rotaxane and
pseudorotaxane constructs, where the alkylamines act as an axle
and the CB[6] the wheel such as with 1,8-diaminooctane.54 A
1:1:1 system with CB[6] and cyclodextrin using a dihexylammonium guest has also been reported.55 Threads
containing pyridinium and imidazolium moieties have also
been widely reported in contructing pseudorotaxanes and
rotaxanes with CB[6]. For example, a [2]pseudorotaxane
system was reported using structure A1, where the host is
located over the hexamethyl chain of the guest. In a dynamic
rotaxane derived from a CB[6] complex with a bispyridinium
guest (A2), CB[6] is able to shuttle between the two
pyridinium groups.56 Self-assembly of pseudorotaxanes constructed with A3·CB[6]57 and A4·CB[6]58 has been reported
to form infinite hydrogen-bonded one-dimensional and twodimensional networks. Other high-order rotaxane-based structural frameworks have also been reported,59 including
polypseudorotaxanes.60,61 He and co-workers reported the
formation of pseudorotaxanes with a series of bis-pyridinium
compounds (see A5 in Figure 5), where the binding site of
CB[6] could be tailored by increasing length of the chains at
the two ends of the guest.62
Several [3]rotaxanes have been reported based on
imidazolium-containing structures (A664 and A765). Recently,
photoresponsive dithienylethene-based rotaxanes (A8) were
constructed with CB[6].66 CB[6] has also been used to form
water-soluble [5]rotaxane and [5]pseudorotaxane using a mesotetraphenyl porphyrin (see A9 in Figure 6) with pH-driven
switchable properties.63 These selective recognition properties of CB[6] were first
ultilized by Kim and co-workers in order to construct a
fluorescent molecular switch based on a pseudorotaxane
structure.67 Various fluorescent sensors have been reported
using the indicator-displacement strategy with dye molecules
derivatized with diaminoalkyl derivatives (see A10−A13 in
Figure 7), whereby the alkyl moiety anchors strongly inside the
CB[6] cavity.68−70 Recently, the fluorescence emission of
pyrene was reported to get enhanced in the presence of CB[6]
as a result of external supramolecular interactions between
pyrene and CB[6].71 CB[6] has also been used for the
detection of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, the active
constituent in ecstasy samples, using cyclic voltammetry.72
Catecholamines such as adrenaline73 and isoprenaline74 show
distinct binding behavior between CB[6]. In particular, a
striking transformation of the crystals of the complex from
needle-like to prismatic structures can be observed over a
period of a few days (Figure 8 a−c).73 This is attributed to the
formation of a 1:1 CB[6]·adrenaline complex as a kinetic
product, which slowly evolves to form a 2:1 thermodynamically
favored complex (Figure 8 d and 8e). Furthermore, in the same
study, binding between dimerized adrenaline and CB[6] in
acidic media was also reported (Figure 8f).


Characterization of the binding parameters for CB[6] and its
guests is usually challenging in water owing to the poor
aqueous solubility of CB[6]. A remarkable number of crystal
structures, however, have been reported for CB[6]·guest
complexes, which provide important structural insights into
the complexed adduct formation. While the binding of CB[6]
with aromatic compounds is surprising because of its smaller
cavity diameter, it is noteworthy that arylamines with suitable
substituents are known to become encapsulated within the
CB[6] cavity.50 This remarkable observation is particularly clear
in the crystallographic structures reported for CB[6]·pxylylenediammonium-ion adducts, whereby an ellipsoidal
distortion of the host molecule upon guest encapsulation is
clearly observed;75,76 however differences may exist between
solid and aqueous forms of this complex. Although CB[6] is typically unable to accommodate six-membered aromatic rings,
five-membered aromatic rings such as thiophenes50 and
furans77 are able to bind to CB[6].
CB[6] is widely applied in separation science. For example,
in a recent study, monolithic poly(glycidyl methacrylate-coethylene dimethacrylate) capillary columns were incorporated
with CB[6] monorotaxanes for application in polymer
monolith microextraction to separate and preconcentrate
nitroaromatics. These monoliths were used for trace analysis
of nitroaromatic compounds in blood and water with 83−107%
recovery.
78 In another study, a new type of stationary phase was
constructed using CB[6] in combination with a guanidiniumbased ionic liquid.79
The ability of CB[n] to modulate chemical reactions has
been known since the first report of the acceleration of 1,3-
dipolar cycloaddition reaction under the catalytic influence of
CB[6] reported by Mock and co-workers.3 Moreover, using the
inclusion of bromine and iodine as was previously reported by
Nau and co-workers,80 Reddy and co-workers have shown the
application of these halogen inclusion complexes such as I2−
CB[6] for catalytic reactions and Br2−CB[6] to achieve
electrophilic bromination of benzene and formation of
bromohydrin.81
Recently, the role of CB[6] in the protection of selenocystamine was demonstrated against redox stimuli (Figure 9). The
Se−Se bonds were shown to be stable in the presence of CB[6]
when exposed to H2O2, a strong oxidizing agent, and tris(2-
carboxyethyl)phosphine, a strong reductant. CB[6] is able to
modulate the reaction of the selenocystamine by encapsulating
the Se−Se bonds inside its cavity. Selenocystamine forms a
strong host−guest complex with CB[6] under acidic conditions
(pH 5.8) with a log K value of 6.7 at 25 °C as measured by
ITC. The protection behavior was shown to be applicable over
a wide range of pH values (up to 11.8). Furthermore, the
reactivity of selenocystamine guest was fully recovered through
dissociation with CB[6] upon addition of BaCl2.82 The ability
of CB[6] to catalyze and template reactions will be discussed in
greater detail in section 11.
Several CB[6]-ion adducts have been examined recently.83−90 Cd(II)−CB[6] complexes have been investigated
comprehensively in an electrochemical study through competitive binding with acetic acid, isobutylamine, and 1,5-
diaminopentane.86 The use of CB[6]-ion complexes is also
emerging in materials chemistry, for example, as Sr(II)−CB[6]-
based polymers87 and hexachloroplatinate(IV) anion·CB[6]-
based porous materials have been reported.88 Theury and coworkers reported the formation of La+ ammoniocarboxylate
complexes with CB[6].83 Later, the luminescent properties of
CB[6] coordination compounds with La+ (Eu, Sm, Tb, and
Tm) were also investigated in acidic aqueous media.89 In
another study, a new mononuclear dysprosium(III)−
cucurbit[6]uril complex was synthesized and characterized
structurally and magnetically.90 Chen and co-workers also
reported the CB[6]-based capture of Cs+ cations.91
The binding of ions such as alkali metals at the portals of the
CB[6] have been well known. In a previous study investigating
the properties of CB[6] as a sorptive material for (textile) dyes,
the presence of cations such as Ca2+ or Sr2+ enhanced the
binding of the dyes to CB[6].92 On the contrary, in a study
with methyl viologen and CB[6], where methyl viologen is only
able to interact with CB[6] externally, even the presence of salt
hindered these weak interactions between them.93 Molecular
dynamic simulations also show evidence of the preferential
formation of CB[6]·Na+ complexes in the presence of
hexamethylene diammonium cations in saline solutions.94
Therefore, while the introduction of ions is often necessary
in order to enhance the solubility of CB[6] in water, their role
as an interferent between CB[6] and binding with other
organic guests cannot be ignored.


5. SPECIFIC BINDING PROPERTIES OF CB[7]
CB[7], the third member of the macrocyclic family, is large
enough to form inclusion complexes with guest molecules that
are typically bulkier than simple aliphatic chains and gas
molecules that are usually encapsulated by the smaller
homologues, CB[5] and CB[6].15 On account of it is larger
cavity size relative to CB[6], a much wider range of guests can
be recognized by CB[7] and encapsulated within, often
exhibiting highly favorable binding parameters, see Table 5.
Specifically, CB[7] has a portal diameter of 5.4 Å and cavity
diameter of 7.3 Å, see Table 1.95 This affords CB[7] an inner
cavity volume of 279 Å3, large enough for the inclusion of
simple three-dimensional molecules such as ferrocene and
adamantylamine derivatives (see Figure 10 for examples),
accompanied by high binding constants (log K > 12). This
occurs through excellent cavity-filling effects, expelling all “highenergy” water molecules from the macrocycle core.41 These
particularly impressive binding constants are undoubtedly one
reason for the large number of reports in the recent literature,
with over 90 individual publications in 2014 alone.
Not only does CB[7] have a cavity size amenable to the
encapsulation of sizable guest molecules but also it has a much
greater aqueous solubility relative to other members of the
CB[n] family, exhibiting a water solubility of 30 mM compared
to 0.01 mM for CB[8] (also large enough to encapsulate 3D
guest molecules).15 This greater solubility coupled with the
larger cavity volume has resulted in a variety of aqueous specific
applications of CB[7], particularly in drug encapsulation as
described in a recent review.18 Drug encapsulation is not the
only biomedical area where CB[7] has been utilized; numerous
reports from Urbach and others have highlighted binding of
CB[7] to peptides, proteins, biomolecules (i.e., neurotransmitters), and dyes, demonstrating applicability to highly accurate
biosensing applications at subnanomolar concentrations.96−98
CB[7]’s solubility at usual drug therapeutic levels has also leant
the macrocycle toward a wide range of toxicity assessing
studies, from in vitro studies to mouse and zebrafish
models.99−102 Although CB[7] is not the perfect representation
of biocompatibility for all other members of the CB[n] family,
the good degree of tolerability demonstrated in these studies is
promising.
As a result of these highly favorable binding equilibria, CB[7]
has found other unique uses, ranging from the assembly of
supramolecular energy-transfer motifs, stimuli-responsive
underwater adhesives, to catalysis.17,103,104 The CB[7] literature
has dramatically expanded over the past decade, and potential
applications of the macrocycle are continuously emerging. We
expect to see vast progress and efforts in the area of controlled
functionalization and attachment of CB[7] receptors to a
variety of materials, whereby the CB[7] can be isolated within a
material still allowing for high-affinity binding.105


6. SPECIFIC BINDING PROPERTIES OF CB[8]
The cavity volume of CB[8] is 479 Å3, which is similar to γ-CD
and 1.7 times larger than that of CB[7], and its binding
properties parallel in many ways those of CB[5]−CB[7].15
CB[8] displays relatively strong binding affinities toward bulky
amphiphilic positively charged guests including adamantane
and ferrocene derivatives C1−C5 (binding constants were
determined by competition with melamine-derived guest C6
for a limiting quantity of CB[8], see Figure 11 and Tables 6 and
7).106 It can also encapsulate larger macrocyclic guests
including cyclen(1,4,7,10-tetra/-aza/-cyclo/-do/-decane) and
cyclam(1,4,8,11-tetra/-aza/-cyclo/-tetra/-decane) (C7 and C8
in Figure 11), thus allowing formation of a “macrocycle within
macrocycle” complex.13 Kim and co-workers were able to
metalate the bound tetraaza macrocycles with Cu(II) and
Zn(II), thus yielding Russian doll-type metal-ion complexes.107,108 This strategy has been further exploited to
prepare a large number of inclusion compounds of transition
metal complexes including nickel(II).109−111 The inclusion of
the dimethylated cyclen C9 (Figure 11) has also been
reported.112 CB[8] has even shown the ability to bind larger
guests such as fullerene, forming complexes with two fullerene
guests bound externally to the CB[8] portals, one being bound
to each portal.113 In the presence of CB[8], alkylammonium
salts equipped with long aliphatic chains, C10−C15 (Figure
11), bend and are incorporated inside the cavity of the host by
adopting a U-shaped conformation.114,115 When the same
guests are in the presence of the smaller CB[7], only the signals
corresponding to the methylene protons near the charged
group shift in the 1H NMR of the complex while the signals of
the protons at the terminal end of the guest chain, far away
from the charged group, remain unchanged. This suggests that
the CB[7] sits nearby the ammonium group with the other end
of the guest protruding from the macrocycle cavity. On the contrary, all methylene proton signals are shifted when in the
presence of CB[8], suggesting that the larger width of the
CB[8] cavity allows the aliphatic chain to form a U-shape so
that the entire guest can be encapsulated. The U-shaped
conformation of the guest inside the cavity of CB[8] was
supported by X-ray crystal structures and ROESY NMR. The
authors suggested that van der Waals contact between the
hydrophobic chain and the cavity can be the main cause of the
significantly large enthalpic gain overcompensating the entropic
penalty associated with the conformational restriction of the Ushaped aliphatic chain. It has been nevertheless suggested that
dispersion interactions inside the CB[n] cavity do not present a
significant enthalpic driving force for guest inclusion.35 Other
doubly charged alkylammonium salts including 1,4-butylidene
and 1,10-decylidenedipyridinium (C16 and C17 in Figure 11)
and 1,12-dodecane diammonium (C18 in Figure 11), in the
presence of 1 equiv of CB[8], also exhibit the previously
described U-shaped folding of C10−C15.116,117 In the case of
C18, both charged groups bind to the same CB[8] portal with
one water molecule bridging the two ammonium groups.
The encapsulation of nitroxide derivatives inside CB[8] has
recently been described on several occasions by Kaifer,
Lucarini, Tordo, Ouari, Turro, Ramamurthy, and
others.118−127 Lucarini and co-workers reported in 2009 the
encapsulation of an amino-TEMPO nitroxide derivative, C19,
inside CB[8] and observed changes in the nitrogen hyperfine
splitting by electron paramagneting resonance (EPR), which
were attributed to the formation of a host−guest complex.118
Furthermore, cooling of an aqueous solution of CB[8]·C19
from room temperature to 5 °C led to the formation of a
macroscopic fibrous network, which exhibited the characteristic
EPR spectrum of a polyradical (solid fibers). The authors
suggested the formation of the supramolecular ternary radical
CB[8]3·C193 to explain the EPR spectrum of the fibers
dissolved in a NaCl (1 mM) aqueous solution at room
temperature. The existence of a supramolecular ternary radical
was demonstrated by Tordo, Ouari, and co-workers, who used
nitroxide C20 as a probe to investigate the binding properties
of CB[8].119 These authors established the concentrationdependent aggregation behavior of CB[7]·C20 and CB[8]·C20
and the formation of a CB[8]3·C203 trinitroxide supraradical
both in solution and in the solid state. Similar conclusions were
obtained by Turro, Ramamurthy, and co-workers after
investigating the interactions between CB[8] and nitroxides
C21−C23.120 Kaifer and co-workers investigated the interaction between CB[n] and a series of cobaltocenium and
ferrocene derivatives incorporating nitroxide units into their
structures (see C24−C28 in Figure 11).121−123 Nitroxide
derivative C24 exhibits a bimodal binding interaction with
CB[7] and CB[8]. While CB[7] prefers to bind to the
cobaltocenium group, CB[8] interacts with the nitroxide group,
forming a highly stable host−guest complex (see Table 6). On
the other hand, C25 contains two nitroxide radicals, thus
allowing the quantitative formation of a ternary CB[8]2·C25
host−guest complex at micromolar concentrations. The
binding of CB[8] imparts rigidity to the final supramolecular
structure and effectively hinders any spin exchange coupling,
which results in a simple three-line EPR spectrum of the
complex. The ternary complex was even characterized by solid
state by X-ray diffraction. Tordo and co-workers recently
reported the reversible modulation of the spin exchange
interaction in tetranitroxide C29 controlled by the allosteric
complexation of CB[8].124 Addition of CB[8] to an aqueous
solution of C29 transforms the nine-line spectrum of the
tetranitroxide into a three-line spectrum characteristic of a
mononitroxide. The noncovalent interaction between CB[8]
and C29 involves a highly cooperative asymmetric complexation (log K1 = 3.60 M; log K2 = 5.30; α = 201) whereby two
CB[8] molecules bind tightly to a single C29 guest, leading to a
rigid complex with remote nitroxide moieties. The authors
attribute the high allosteric interaction energy (ΔΔGallos·C29 ≈
13 kJ·mol−1) to a combination of different factors including the
preorganized skeleton of the multivalent guest which is multiply H-bond donating, a potential CB[8]-induced shift of the pKa of
the internal amines, and the intrinsic conformational properties
of C29. 


The binding of the first CB[8] molecule in this instance
induces a large conformational change in the guest, which
favors the binding of the second CB[8] molecule.
Although the smaller homologues of the CB[n] family can
bind only one guest inside the cavity, CB[8] is unique in its
ability to bind two guests, as has been shown by Kim and
others.128−132 This rather unique binding property has been
exploited in a wide variety of applications including novel
supramolecular polymeric materials,133−135 catalysis,20,136−138
and sensing.98,139−141 CB[8] promotes (hetero)dimerization of
two π systems in aqueous solution, and Kim and co-workers
have shown that CB[8]·C30 can bind to a variety of other
aromatic guests including 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene, 1,4-
dihydroxybenzene, tyrosine, dopamine and thymine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, tryptophan derivatives, and tryptophancontaining peptides.128,129,142 On the basis of this concept, a
CB[8] heteroternary complexation strategy to the reversible
PEGylation of bovine serum albumin and protein−protein
dimer formation was developed by Scherman and co-workers.
143 Brunsveld and co-workers also exploited this concept in
protein−protein binding and protein-to-surface attachment by
using methylviologen and naphthalene-functionalized fluorescent proteins and CB[8].144,145
Scherman and co-workers studied in detail the equilibria of a
series of ternary complexes based on CB[8]·C30 and a wide
variety of aromatic second guest molecules by ITC and ESI-MS
(see Table 8 and Figure 12). The binding constants were found
to be between log K = 2.00 and 6.00. An excellent agreement
between solution-based titrations (ITC) and gas-phase studies
was found when free energies of solvation are taken into
consideration.146 Kaifer and co-workers reported the formation
of CB[8] ternary complexes between 2,7-dimethyldiazapyrenium, as first guest, and catechol and dopamine as second
guests.147 In an analogous fashion, 2,7-dimethyldiazaphenanthrenium can also form ternary complexes in the presence of
CB[8] with tryptophan and serotonin.132 Scherman and coworkers also identified a group of doubly charged molecules as
potential alternatives that increase the repertoire of first guests
for CB[8]. These include t etramethylbenzobis-
(imidazolium),148 aryl-bisimidazolium salts,149 aryl viologen
derivatives,42 and water-soluble perylene bis(diimides).150 The
binding of dicationic dyes such as 2,7-dimethyldiazapyrenium,
as first guest to CB[8], has been cleverly used by Biedermann,
Nau, and co-workers to construct a chirality sensor and
peptide-sequence recognition system at micromolar analyte
concentrations.45,151
Alternatively to the previously mentioned heteroternary
complexes, a number of guests have been shown to undergo
double encapsulation into CB[8] including napththyl derivatives,4 coumarin,152 N-phenylpiperazine,153 9-aminoacridinium,154 neutral red,155 1-[2-methylnaphthyl]-3-methylimidazolium,156 berberine,157 p-dimethylaminobenzonitrile,158 phenylpyridinium derivatives,159,160 bipyridinium salts,161 anthracene derivatives,162,163 and some specific peptide sequences
containing tryptophan or phenylalanine residues164,165
Some selected radical cations can also dimerize inside CB[8]
in an analogous fashion to homodimer complexes. Kim and coworkers described that a high-affinity CB[8] homoternary
complex can be produced when methyl viologen is reduced to
its radical cation species.142 Kaifer and co-workers have shown
that CB[8] can be used to exert redox control over the
dimerization of dendrons. For instance, dendrons containing a
dicationic viologen group at their focal point can form stable
1:1 inclusion complexes with CB[8].166 Upon one-electron
reduction, the radical cation group of the dendron−viologen
species forms a dimer inside the CB[8] cavity, in analogy to
simple viologen. This idea has been further exploited to control
the structure of dimeric dendritic assemblies from viologen−
and dialkoxybenzene−dendrons.131 Another interesting example of a redox CB[8]-mediated switch consists of an equimolar
mixture of methylviologen, TTF derivative C60, and CB[8].
This ternary mixture results in the formation of a heteroternary
complex CB[8]·MV2+·C60 potentially stabilized by electronrich−electron-poor π−π stacking interactions.167 Upon treatment with Na2S2O4, viologen is reduced to MV+•, which results
in complex disproportionation, yielding CB[8]·(MV+•)2.
Exposure to O2 returns the system to the parent heteroternary
complex state. On the contrary, treatment of CB[8]·MV2+·C60
with Fe(ClO4) oxidizes C60 to C60b+•, thus resulting in a disproportionation to yield CB[8]·(C60b+•)2, as evidenced by
UV/vis spectroscopy. This last transformation can be reverted
upon addition of ascorbic acid. The ternary complex CB[8]·
MV2+·C60 can therefore be defined as a reversible molecular
switch that exists in three different states in a stimulusdependent manner.


7. ENCAPSULATION OF GASEOUS SPECIES IN CB[n]
Cucurbiturils have shown great promise in applications that
include polymer and nanoparticle constructs because of their
ability to sequester specific molecules within their unique inner
cavities. This, in addition to cucurbiturils’ high chemical and
thermal stability, has driven researchers to utilize cucurbiturils
in the area of gas encapsulation and storage. Sorption of gases
such as CO2, CO, and CH4 could lead to effective greenhouse
gas capture technologies, in addition to being incorporated into
nanoparticle structures for advanced sensing and photochemical applications.
In the area of gas sorption research, metal organic
frameworks (MOFs) have garnered interest. Along with porous
coordination polymers (PCPs), MOFs have very high surface
areas and have demonstrated selectivity and capacity for
adsorbing gases like CO2, making them competitive candidates
for gas encapsulation.168 The issues that MOFs and PCPs face
is that they can be sensitive to water, which minimizes their
utility in cleaning flue gases. Cucurbiturils, on the other hand,
are stable in the presence of water and are easily made from
cheap organic molecules, paving the way toward stable and
effective alternatives in gas sorption. They have demonstrated
gas uptake capacities comparable to some MOFs and
PCPs.169,170
On account of the small nature of gaseous molecules, gas
absorption tends to be favored by the smaller cucurbiturils.
This is because the smaller inner cavities of CB[5] and CB[6]
favor encapsulation of small guests as compared to the larger
internal cavities of CB[7] and CB[8]. Furthermore, the
solubilities of CB[5] and CB[6] have allowed their application
in sorption of gases in different ways, with the water-soluble
CB[5] finding use in aqueous-phase gas sorption and the less
soluble CB[6] being favored for use in powdered form geared
toward the cleaning of flue gases. However, CB[6] is not
limited in its use in aqueous phase gas sorption by its low
aqueous solubility because its solubility can be enhanced in
water through the use of alkali metal ions and water-soluble
guest molecules. Also, it is readily soluble in strongly acidic
solutions.25,69
7.1. CB[5] Gas Sorption
A permethylated form of CB[5] (decamethylcucurbit[5]uril)
has been shown by Miyahara and co-workers to encapsulate a
variety of gases in both solid form and aqueous media.171 It was
found that gases of intermediate size could be encapsulated
within the cavity of solid decamethylcucurbit[5]uril, such as N2,
O2, Ar, N2O, CO, and CO2, and readily released upon heating,
with N2O and CO2 being the most readily absorbed of the
gases (crystal structures shown in Figure 14). Smaller gases
(He, Ne, and H2) move too freely in and out of the portals to
be absorbed, and larger gases (Kr, Xe, and CH4) could also not
be encapsulated. In the aqueous phase, however, all of the
aforementioned gases could be absorbed, with the larger gases
requiring heating to 80 °C to be incorporated. This suggests
that the solvent molecules play a role in encouraging the
encapsulation of the larger gases, as it is unlikely that the portal
size of the CB[5] would increase significantly upon heating as a
result of the rigidity of the macrocycle.171



7.2. CB[6] Gas Sorption
Solid CB[6] has been shown to have an affinity for CO2
encapsulation, with a sorption capacity that is comparable to
that of MOFs, including HKUST-1 and [Pd(2-pymo)2]n.170 In
2010, Kim and co-workers studied the CO2 sorption properties
of solid CB[6], precipitated from HCl with a honeycomb-like
crystal structure. Gas absorption isotherms for CO2, CH4, and
CO showed a high capacity for CO2 storage and selectivity for
CO2 over both CO and CH4, with 45 cm3 g−1 absorbed at 298
K (1 bar). This could be increased to 97 cm3 g−1 at 196 K (1
bar). X-ray analysis of CB[6] after CO2 sorption demonstrated
that CO2 was bound not only to the inner cavity of the
cucurbiturils but also externally to the CB molecules via
hydrogen-bonding and dipole−quadrupole interactions with
the carbonyl portals (Figure 15a). This demonstrated that the
selectivity of solid CB[6] toward CO2 could be useful in
removing CO2 from flue gases.
Continuing on from the work of Kim and co-workers, Tian
and co-workers successfully synthesized three alternate
crystalline forms of CB[6], termed forms I, II, and III, via the
mixing of ethanol into a solution of CB[6] in 6 M HCl.172
Form I crystals were shown to be in the monoclinic point
group, with the CB[6] molecules stacking into a double bilayer
structure (Figure 15b). Form III crystals were shown to be
rhombohedral in nature, with the molecules stacking in a
bilayer structure (Figure 15c), while form II crystals were
unable to be characterized by X-ray crystallography owing to
difficulties in growing suitable crystals for diffraction. Despite
this, form II exhibited the best thermal stability, with forms I
and III losing crystallinity upon heating, as well as the highest
surface area, with BET isotherms yielding values of 276 m2 g−1.
The high surface area and thermal stability of form II gives the
material promise in gas storage applications, with 76 cm3 g−1 of
CO2 uptake at 298 K (1 bar). Although more focused on
catalytic applications, Reddy and co-workers demonstrated that
solid CB[6] has a propensity to absorb I2 and Br2 vapor, leading
to distinctly colored CB[6]−halogen powders.81 The catalytic
properties of these materials shall be discussed in section 11.
While pure CB[6] is generally not suitable for gas
encapsulation in aqueous environments because of its
inherently low solubility, it can be made soluble through the
use of metal ions, aliphatic or aromatic ammonium ions, or
neutral saline aqueous solutions. In such environments, CB[6]
has been demonstrated to encapsulate Xe,173,174 SF6,175,176 as
well as gaseous alkanes and alkenes.69
El Haouaj and co-workers demonstrated the encapsulation of
Xe by CB[6] in a 0.2 M solution of Na2SO4, with binding
constants ranging from 2.1 × 102 M−1 (although 3.4 × 102 M−1
has been reported for an alkylated CB[6] with higher water
solubility177). The reversible binding was confirmed through
1H and 129Xe NMR, and it was shown that pH played little role
in the sorption of the noble gas. SF6 has also been shown to be
encapsulated in aqueous CB[6], however binding constants
vary.
175,176 The first report of SF6 binding, confirmed via 19F
NMR, yielded a binding of 3.1 × 104 M−1 in 0.2 M Na2SO4;
however, binding in pure water yields a binding constant of 6.6
× 105 M−1.176 The higher binding constant in pure water could
be attributed to the absence of cations in the solution, which
would potentially block the carbonyl portals of the CB[6] and
perturb gas encapsulation.
The difficulty of determining binding constants for gases in
aqueous CB[6] systems arises from the low solubility of CB[6]
in water. To overcome this, Florea and co-workers adopted a
dye displacement titration method for measuring the binding
constants of hydrocarbon gases (see Figure 16 for schematic).69
A compound with a putrescine moiety for binding to CB[6]
tethered to a 1-naphthylamine-5-sulfonic acid chromophore
was used as the displacement dye owing to the enhancement in its fluorescence upon binding to CB[6] and its ability to
dramatically increase the solubility of CB[6] in water. The
fluorescence of the dye was monitored as gases were introduced
into the aqueous system, and binding constants were calculated
from the final fluorescence intensity, assuming 1:1 stoichiometric binding. Binding constants ranged from <2 M−1 for
methane and neopentane up to 1300 ± 300 M−1 for
cyclopentane (binding constants from the cited work can be
found in Table 3).
7.3. Gas Sorption in Higher CB[n] Homologues
To date there has only been one report on gas sorption in
CB[7], which has shown a high sorption capacity for various
gases, including CO2, SO2, and H2S.169 Of the three gases, SO2
showed the highest capacity for being absorbed, with uptake as
high as 105 cm3 g−1, followed by H2S (62.5 cm3 g−1) and CO2
(50 cm3 g−1). Although CH4 and N2 were tested, low uptakes
of 5.5−6 cm3 g−1 were observed. Reports of gas absorption in
CB[8] and CB[10] have not yet appeared.


8. CUCURBIT[n]URILS ON SURFACES
The influence of the overall electrostatic potential map of
CB[n] on its molecular encapsulation properties is evident. The
high electron density at its carbonyl portals, however, governs
the external interactions of CB[n] with materials such as cations
and metallic surfaces (Figure 17a). The latter property is
increasingly drawing attention for applications ranging from
nanoparticle synthesis, assembly, catalysis, and plasmon-assisted
molecular sensing. In addition, CB[n] can also be localized at
interfaces through interactions with immobilized guests on
surfaces (Figure 17b) as well as by covalently linking
functionalized homologues of CB[n] directly to a surface
(Figure 17c). Although electrostatic interactions of CB[n] are
mainly limited to metallic substrates, the other two types of
binding strategies are applicable to other substrates such as
silica and quantum dots. These interactions have been applied
successfully to design novel sensors and reversible architectures.
Progress in these fields will be discussed in this section.
8.1. Electrostatic Interactions
The direct supramolecular interaction of CB[n] with gold was
first successfully characterized by An and co-workers in 2008,178
where the interaction between gold nanoparticle colloids and
CB[n] was established using TEM and UV/vis characterization.
CB[n] acted as a “glue” between adjacent nanoparticles,
resulting in the formation of coagulates (Figure 18a and
18b). In a further step, the formation of CB[7] self-assembled
monolayers was achieved simply by dipping a planar gold
substrate into a saturated aqueous solution of CB[7]. The
CB[7] molecules physisorb on the gold surface. Surface
characterization techniques, including Fourier transform IR
reflection absorption spectroscopy and XPS, indicated that the
interactions between CB[7] and gold occurred through the
electronegative carbonyl portals of CB[7], where the CB[7]
portals were oriented in a perpendicular fashion with respect to the gold surface (Figure 18c). In the same study, the surface
packing of CB[7] was estimated to be >48% using an indirect
electrochemical method; nevertheless, the true density of
CB[n] molecules on flat metallic surfaces remains unascertained.



8.1.1. Modification and Assembly of Nanoparticles
with CB[n]. Despite the limited fundamental knowledge about
CB[n] interactions with metallic surfaces, particularly in
colloidal systems, CB[n] has been shown to be useful in the
synthesis of nanoparticles, mainly as a “capping agent” or
“stabilizing ligand”. The first synthesis of CB[n]-assisted
nanoparticles was reported by Geckeler and co-workers,
where CuO nanoparticles (diameter ≈ 5 nm) were formed
using precursor-encapsulated CB[7].179 The same group later
reported a one-pot synthesis of silver180 and gold nanoparticles181 by the reaction of aqueous CB[7] solutions
containing the respective precursor salts and NaOH at room
temperature. In both cases, CB[7] acted as a stabilizing ligand
and generated well-dispersed nanoparticles. Since no additional
reducing agents were used, the role of CB[7] as a reducing
agent, in addition to stabilizing ligand, in nanoparticle synthesis
was also established. However, it should be noted that the
oxidized organic species resulting from salt reduction remains
unidentified. The same applies to the reaction mechanism.
In the same year, Scherman and co-workers reported the
formation of dynamic aggregates of gold nanoparticles using
CB[5].182 In this case, the nanoparticles were prepared in the
presence of a reducing agent as well as CB[5], where
concurrent with other reports180,181 CB[5] was once again
shown to act as a capping agent. The sizes of these aggregates
could be controlled by varying the ratio between CB[5] and the
gold precursor and was based on the interactions of one or both
carbonyl portals of the CB[5] molecules. The symmetric
structure of the CB[n] is of particular importance to allow the
CB[5] molecules to bridge two nanoparticles. The aggregation
process was monitored by measuring the changes in the surface
plasmon resonance of the colloidal solution. Typically,
monodisperse gold nanoparticles absorb in the green region
of the visible spectrum and appear as red solutions. Upon
aggregation, the absorbance signal undergoes a red shift and the
solutions appear purple or blue instead. The kinetic evolution
of these plasmonic modes was reported later in greater
detail.183
This was followed by another study, where CB[5], CB[7], as
well as the less water-soluble homologues, CB[6] and CB[8],
were also investigated as capping agents using metastable gold
nanoparticles.184 Importantly, the interparticle spacing between
neighboring nanoparticles was confirmed by TEM to be
approximately 1 nm, which is consistent with the height of CB[n] molecules. This further indicates the portal−metal
interactions between CB[n] and gold. The longer stability (∼3
months) of the resulting nanoparticles was further attributed to
the presence of sodium atoms bound to the carbonyl portals of
the CB[5] ligands. Once again, the aggregates exhibited
reversible control as before.
More recently, CB[7]-stabilized gold nanoparticles were
synthesized in order to demonstrate the increase in catalytic
efficiency of nanoparticles free from organic ligands and metal
cations.185 The stabilization of silver nanoparticles with CB[n]
homologues has also been further investigated,186 whereby
computational studies supported the assumption that the
stabilizing effect of CB[7] is a result of lateral interactions
between the oxygen atoms at the CB[7] carbonylated rim and
the metal surface.
It is noteworthy, however, that the role of CB[n]-capped
gold nanoparticles is not restricted to stabilization of nanoparticles. Plasmonic coupling between aggregated nanoparticles
affects their optical response and leads to strongly enhanced
electric fields in the gaps between them.187,188The magnitude of
those fields increases near-exponentially as the distance
between the particles is reduced and is limited only by electron
tunneling for gaps below ∼0.5 nm.189−193 Owing to the
symmetrical geometry of CB[n], the presence of CB[n] in
between nanoparticles ensures that they are held precisely 0.9
nm apart from each other (Figure 18b).183 This provides both
extremely high and reproducible local field enhancements in
the gap junctions194,195 while maintaining an accessible gap for
small molecules.139,141 Since such precision at these scales is
not easily achievable, physicists have to predominantly rely on
theoretical simulations in order to understand the optics at such
nanoscale regimes. Therefore, CB[n] provides a support handle
to experimentally investigate the plasmon modes and near-field
properties of nanoparticle clusters with well-defined separations.196
The precise gap distances between adjacent nanoparticles
produced by CB[n] has further useful implications. For
example, these CB[n]−gold nanoparticle hybrids have been
utilized to create near-identical, continuous strings of nanoparticles joined by a conducting gold thread.197 In this study,
precise control over the formation of the nanomaterial was
achieved on a large scale by irradiating the CB[n]-mediated
nanoparticle assemblies with a suitable femtosecond pulsed
laser. As a result of high field intensities in the gap junctions
between the nanoparticles, the surface atoms are drawn into the
gap through optical forces and nonthermal melting and form
solid metal threads between the particles. The extreme
enhanced fields in the crevices of the resulting threads open
up prospects for applications of these metamaterials in
photovoltaics and sensing probe construction.
In consideration of the interesting plasmonic and electronic
properties afforded by CB[n]-mediated gold nanoparticle
assemblies, sophisticated strategies have been developed in
order to control the morphologies of these clusters. One such
strategy allows the well-defined growth of one-dimensional
chains of gold nanospheres, spaced by CB[n] molecules.198
This is achieved in a chamber consisting of gold nanoparticles
and CB[n] solution separated by a nanoporous polycarbonate
membrane. The one-dimensional chains are then formed at the
membrane interface by the electrophoretic flow of the
nanoparticles under an applied voltage and the electroosmotic
flow of the CB[n] (Figure 19).
End-to-end gold nanorod alignments can also be formed
through CB[n] linkers.199 Centrifugation of CTAB-coated gold
nanorod solutions preferentially destabilizes the CTAB bilayer
at the curved {111} end facets of the nanorods. Therefore,
upon subsequent addition, CB[5] is only able to interact with
the nanorod ends, consequently forming nanorod chain-like
topologies. The surface plasmon resonance bands of gold
nanorods can be tuned over a wider range than those of
nonanisotropic analogues, making them interesting candidates
for plasmonic applications.


8.1.2. SERS Sensing. An important property of CB[n]
interactions with metallic surfaces is its ability to retain its
molecular recognition properties. In other words, CB[n] can
facilitate guest molecules from the bulk solution to approach
the metal−liquid interface by acting as a “receptor” on the
surface. Surface-dependent phenomena, such as catalysis and
surface-enhanced spectroscopic (SERS) techniques, generally
require molecules to be localized near the surfaces and often
rely on the innate affinity of the molecules toward these
surfaces. Since not all molecules of interest interact with
surfaces spontaneously, covalent functionalization strategies are
often used to immobilize them on surfaces. However, such
strategies usually reduce the direct interactions of the molecules
with the surface, thereby interfering with the efficiency of the
surface processes. Therefore, it is evident that the ability of
CB[n] to confine molecules of interest near the surface has
dramatic significance in surface-dependent mechanisms.
The molecular recognition the properties of CB[n] can be
harnessed for sensing with SERS.98,139−141,183,200 In brief,
Raman spectroscopy is a vibrational technique, which probes
the inelastic scattering of photons with molecules and is able to
provide a unique fingerprint for each analyte. While this
method is comparable to infrared spectroscopy, the lack of
interference from water molecules (in the fingerprint region)
makes this method desirable for probing chemical structures,
particularly in aqueous environments. However, the inherent
weakness of Raman signals requires the use of enhancement
mechanisms, such as the use of plasmonic surfaces, to improve
sensitivity. One particularly popular approach is surfaceenhanced Raman spectroscopy, and the reader is referred to
the literature on this topic for further details.201−204
Although Raman spectroscopy was used as an analytical
method to characterize encapsulation of a polymer in multiple
CB[n] units,205 the first report of a detailed study of the Raman
and SERS signature of CB[n] appeared in the literature in
2010.206 Clearly identifiable peaks for CB[n] are observed in
the fingerprint region (400−2000 cm−1) of the Raman spectra
(Figure 20). Two characteristic intense signals at approximately
450 and 830 cm−1 are attributed to complex ring breathing
modes of the CB[n] molecules. Interestingly, these signals
show slight red and blue shifts, respectively, with an increase in
the ring sizes of the different CB[n] homologues. The same
signals and a similar trend in peak shifts is observed in the
corresponding SERS spectra. A SERS enhancement factor of
107−109 is achieved with CB[n]:gold nanoparticle aggregates.183,200
SERS-based sensing of a dye molecule, Rhodamine 6G
(Rh6G), with the aforementioned CB[7]:gold nanoparticle
constructs was first demonstrated by Scherman and co-workers
in 2011.183 CB[7] binds to Rh6G in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio
(Ka > 5 × 104 M−1).207 Besides acting as an aggregating agent
to glue together adjacent gold nanoparticles, CB[n] positions
the guest molecules precisely at the point of closest approach between nanoparticles, which is where the highest field
enhancement occurs, also known as a “hot spot”. By bringing
the analyte into the hot spot, tremendous enhancement of the
Raman signal can be seen, even for molecules with a low
Raman cross-section. Thus the role of CB[n] is particularly
significant. For example, another SERS study used neutral
ferrocene with CB[7] (Figure 21).200 In addition, ferrocene
does not have an affinity for gold surfaces but can be localized
in the hot spot using CB[7]. In this case, a three-step approach
was used to prepare the SERS substrates, in which gold
nanoparticles were first assembled on amino-functionalized
glass. Ferrocene-encapsulated CB[7] was subsequently physisorbed on the substrate, followed by another layer of Au
nanoparticles. As a result, gold nanoparticle clusters, predominantly dimers and trimers, were obtained on the glass surface
with ferrocene-encapsulated CB[7] in the hot-spot regions.
The utility of this SERS-based sensor has been extended to
studying CB[n] host−guest chemistry. Computational studies
had shown that CB[n], particularly CB[7], is expected to
undergo a subtle structural distortion on encapsulation of a
guest.208 These structural changes can be seen in the SERS
specta of CB[n] complexes as slightly shifted peaks.139 These
structural changes are not as apparent in the solid-state Raman
spectra of the complexes. These changes, however, are more
pronounced in the Raman signals of the guest molecules.209
Not only did these results present experimental evidence to
support the outcomes of the theoretical predictions, the shifted
and unshifted signals also provided a tool to be able to
distinguish the amounts of complexed and uncomplexed
CB[n]s. Therefore, the system could be used for characterizing
CB[n] host−guest binding parameters as well as absolute
quantification of guest analytes, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons.139 Roldan and co-workers reported the use of this ́
strategy through the incorporation of silver nanoparticles for
the detection of pH-dependent changes in the complexation
behavior of diquat with CB[8].140 The system has also been
used to monitor the real-time photodimerzation of diaminostilbene inside the CB[n] cavity in situ.141
One of the advantages of the SERS technique is its ability to
resolve analytes in a mixture, which is particularly advantageous
for structurally similar molecules. CB[n] compliments this
property of SERS by acting as a receptor for several molecular
analogues. A recent report used this property to test the
multiplexing abilities of CB[n] in sensing structurally similar
metabolites in urine.


8.1.3. Localization of Ligands. CB[n] adsorbed to gold
surfaces have also been used as a platform for immobilizing
biomolecules.210 In this case, methyl ferrocene was functionalized with a glycol spacer and a cysteine end group for ligation
with a yellow fluorescent protein thioester (YFP) (Figure 22).
The protein could then be immobilized on SAMs of CB[7] on
gold surfaces through the strong interactions with the ferrocene
moiety. The proteins from the surfaces could be displaced by
using a competitive guest, such as (ferrocenylmethyl)-
trimethylammonium iodide (K = 1011 M−1). This strategy
gave access to a strong, reversible, and uniform protein
immobilization on surfaces. Similarly, SNAP-fusion cyan
fluorescent protein functionalized with ferrocene was immobilized on SAMs of CB[7], generating fluorescent patterns on the
surfaces.211 This method was then developed further to
immobilize cells on CB[7]-coated surfaces using cyclic RGD
peptide−ferrocene conjugates.212 The RGD peptide allows
enhanced cell adhesion and wound healing. The studies showed
that the cells remained viable on the surfaces when linked via
RGD. In addition, a wound assay also showed successful cell
recovery within 8 h.
CB[7] has also been used to physisorb unsubstituted
methylviologens onto the surface of TiO2 semiconductor
nanoparticle films. The redox-active properties of the viologen
guests were further used to prepare electrochromic windows
that exhibited reversible color switching under applied
potential.



8.2. Guest-Mediated Interactions
Direct supramolecular interactions of surfaces with CB[n] has
undoubtedly opened up avenues for various promising
applications, but controlling these spontaneous interactions
remains challenging. One strategy, which is widely being
reported to gain precise control over the behavior of CB[n]
near surfaces, is to covalently functionalize the surfaces with
molecular structures containing guest moieties. The guestmediated interaction of CB[n] with the surfaces also provides
additional handles for stimuli-responsive and reversible
architectures and is particularly attractive for designing colloidal
systems.
The earliest example of such a system was illustrated through
the construction of a pseudorotaxane self-assembled monolayer
on a planar gold surface using CB[6]. The molecular thread
was anchored on a gold surface through a 1,2-dithiolane
functionality, whereas its diaminobutane unit allowed binding
to CB[6] (Figure 23). The threading of CB[6] could then be
controlled by changing the pH of the system. Furthermore, the
pseudorotaxane acted as a gate to control the access of an
electroactive species, [Fe(CN)6]3−, to the gold surface.214
Similarly, gold nanorods decorated with a hydrophilic CB[7]-
based pseudorotaxane have also been prepared.215
In another example, this method was used to disrupt
aggregation of dye molecules on surfaces where high-density
Rhodamine B-functionalized glass slides showed a higher
degree of heterogeneity and fluorescence quenching. The
addition of CB[7] reduced the heterogeneity and increased the
emission significantly to match that of monomeric Rhodamine
B species.216 More recently, glassy carbon electrodes were
modified with CB[7] in order to construct a glucose sensor
using glucose oxidase as a catalyst.217 In this case, however, a
graphene oxide layer on the electrode was used to enhance the
stability of the CB[7] on the surface. Ferrocenemonocarboxylic
acid, the electron-transfer mediator, can then be captured
through molecular recognition by CB[7]. The applicability of
this sensor was demonstrated in human serum samples.
8.2.1. Ligand Immobilization. On the basis of the finding
that CB[8] is able to induce aggregation in proteins in aqueous
solutions, a layer-by-layer construction of homo- and
heteroprotein stacks on surfaces has been reported (Figure
24).218 In this study, a quartz glass substrate was first modified
with amino groups using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. The
formation of multiple layers of hemoglobin was then achieved
by alternately immersing the substrate in solutions of CB[8]
and protein. The CB[8] acted as a “glue” within the proteins stacks. The lack of need to pretreat or modify the proteins was
particularly highlighted in this work by verification of this
strategy with several unmodified proteins such as catalase,
glutathione-S-transferase agents, and insulin. Recently, Rotello
and co-workers were able to regulate the interactions between
green fluorescent protein and monolayer-coated gold nanoparticles using CB[7].219 The threading of CB[7] on the
surfaces of the nanoparticles led to an increased affinity for the
proteins. The authors consider this to be an outcome of the
increased cationic charge on the nanoparticle surface based on
the slightly positive charge on the outer surface of the
equatorial region of CB[7]. However, potential repulsion
from the negatively charged carbonyl portals was not accounted
for in this proposed mechanism.
Scherman and co-workers reported the utility of viologenfunctionalized gold substrates using CB[8] as a supramolecular
“handcuff” for patterning surfaces with polymeric colloids. Both
1D and 2D patterns were attained.220 The same group also
described a system in which orthogonal switching was achieved
controllably and reversibly by using redox- and photoresponsive
guest molecules and CB[8].221 In this system, a SAM of thiolcontaining azobenzene derivatives was immobilized on a gold
substrate by microcontact printing. Methyl viologen conjugated
with fluorescein dye could be assembled on the surface from
solution via CB[8] “handcuffs” to afford spontaneously formed
2D fluorescent patterns. UV irradiation of the surface converted
the azobenzenes to their cis configuration, which in turn
dissociated the second guest from the CB[8] to turn off the
fluorescence. This process could be reversed by irradiation with
visible light to covert the azobenzene moieties back to their
trans state. Redox-controlled reversibility of the ternary
complex formation provided orthogonal control over the
system. In a more recent study, a facile method was reported
for the preparation of rotaxanes on gold based on CB[8]
threaded onto a viologen axle, Figure 25.222 These surfacebound rotaxanes yielded an interlocked structure, which
prevented the dissociation of the binary complex MV2+·
CB[8]. The stability of the functional surface was thus
maintained for binding with electron-rich second guests for
CB[8] such as small molecules like dopamine and prefunctionalized colloidal particles.


8.2.2. Self-Assembled Architechtures. The ternary
complex formation ability of CB[8] has been used to form
and control end-to-end assemblies of gold nanorods.223 This
was accomplished by first preparing viologen end-functionalized gold nanorods. Then telechelic linker molecules carrying
second guest moieties were added to these gold nanorods in
the presence of CB[8] to form aligned chains. The rigidity of
the resulting chains could be controlled by changing the length
of the linker molecules. Another example of reproducible SERS
with colloids was demonstrated using gold nanoparticles
precoated with cystamine using CB[6] as linkers to generate
gold nanoparticle dimers.224
A colorimetric assay for protein detection was reported based
on CB[8]-induced formation of bulky aggregates of functionalized gold nanoparticles.225 This was achieved by modifying
the gold nanoparticles with peptides containing N-terminal
aromatic residues, which can be accommodated inside the
CB[8] cavity. CB[8] is only able to bind to the peptide in the
absence of the target protein, inducing a visible color change in
the gold nanoparticle solution. The feasibility of this system has
been shown in spiked serum samples with a detection limit of
0.2 nM.
CB[8] has also been used to link methyl viologenfunctionalized polymeric nanoparticles onto silica cores
decorated with 4-hydroxyazobenzene moieties to yield hybrid
“raspberry” colloidal structures in water (Figure 26).226 The
presence of azobenzene groups allows reversible assembly and
disassembly of the constructs with photoirradiation.
8.2.3. Nanovalves. Pioneered by Stoddart and co-workers,
CB[n]-based pseudorotaxane systems on mesoporous silica
have made substantial contributions in the field of gated
nanochemistry.227−230 The release of molecular cargo from
mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MNPs) is achieved by
blocking and unblocking the silica pores by using CB[n] as a
gating moiety. Early reports were based on pH-dependent
actuation of the MNPs.231 Increasing levels of sophistication were steadily introduced to these systems by addition of
features such as tuning of the pH at which the MNPs
responded,232 dual-stimuli constructs capable of exhibiting
logic,233 and magnetic activation.234 Later, CB[7]-based gating
behavior235,236 and alternative approaches to activate the
nanovalves were also published. These include competitive
binding,235 enzyme-triggered systems,236 reductive chemistry
(cleavage of disulfide bonds),237 and light response.238


8.3. Covalent Immobilization
Reversibility in the binding of CB[n] to surfaces may not always
be desirable in order to achieve better stability and recovery of
functionality of the surfaces. Evidently, among the various
strategies that have been explored to link CB[n] and surfaces,
the ability to functionalize CB[n] has been pivotal in addressing
these requirements.
Covalently anchored CB[7] on gold surfaces was first
reported for the production of a glucose sensor.239 The system
was constructed by attachment of allyloxy−CB[7] on vinylterminated alkanethiolate SAMs using olefin cross-metathesis.
Ferrocenylated glucose oxidaze (GOx) was subsequently
immobilized on the surface by means of strong Fc·CB[7]
host−guest interactions. Glucose concentrations could then be
monitored electrochemically using this system. The modification of quantum dots with functionalized CB[6] using thiol
linker groups has been reported to significantly improve their
stability. In another example, the utility of functionalized CB[n] on
surfaces was elegantly demonstrated by Kim and co-workers in
the development of synthetic adhesives, which are functional
even under water.104 Their velcro-type system is based on a
“hook-and-loop” approach where a silicon surface functionalized with CB[7] was used to loop around the guest “hooks”
immobilized on a second silicon surface. In order to immobilize
the CB[7], alkene-functionalized monoallyloxy−CB[7] was
attached to thiol-decorated Si surfaces in a thiol−ene reaction.
The guests 1,1′-bis(trimethylammoniomethyl)ferrocene (BFc)
and aminomethylferrocene (Fc) were chosen on account of
their particularly high binding affinities for CB[7] in water at
1012 and 1015 M−1, respectively. Tunability of adhesiveness was
achieved through varying the densities of “hooks” and “loops”
on the surfaces to control the number of multivalent
interactions between the two silicon surfaces. A reasonable
level of reversibility was also shown with this adhesive through
both chemical and mechanical means. It is noteworthy that
water molecules often act as a contaminating agent in
conventional synthetic adhesives for use under water. On the
contrary, this particular CB[n]-based approach relies on the
expulsion of water molecules in the formation of the CB[7]−
guest complexes to fabricate the desired synthetic adhesives.
8.3.1. CB[n]-Anchored Silica. The use of CB[n]-anchored
silica has been widely reported in separation science. The
production of CB[n]-based stationary phase materials and their
use in chromatography was disclosed in patents by Kim and coworkers.241 The separation of several organic compounds,
including alkaloids, alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols,
esters, ketones, and amines, using silica gel grafted with
perhydroxy−CB[6] has been described in the literature.242,243
However, this method suffers from the presence of excess
potassium sulfate, which hinders immobilization. In order to
address this drawback, another method to fabricate functionalized silica using perallyloxy−CB[6] has also been developed.244 Additionally, silica−CB[n] hybrids prepared using a
sol−gel approach also yields stationary phases for efficient
chromatographic separations.245−247
As an alternative to using covalently modified CB[n], another
method to functionalize CB[7] on surfaces has been reported
using a photochemical reaction with azido groups (Figure
27).248 In this strategy, silica substrates were first modified with
3-amino-propyl-triethoxy-silane to introduce amino groups on
the surface. The primary amine was then reacted with 4-
azidobenzoic acid in the presence of 1-(3-(dimethylamino)-
propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride at basic pH. The
azido groups were then exposed to CB[7] and reacted under
UV irradiation for 10 min to form covalent linkages. While the
mechanism of the functionalization could not be elucidated, the
authors propose the formation of the highly reactive singlet
nitrenes from the azido groups upon UV irradiation. This is
followed by their subsequent insertion into the equatorial C−H
bonds of CB[7].
Lastly, functionalization of electrodes for enhanced analytical
performance has been demonstrated using CB[n]. One such
study particularly exploits the molecular recognition properties
of CB[8] to enhance the selectivity and sensitivity of the
electrochemical determination of tryptophan.249 In brief, the
glassy carbon electrode was modified by exposing it to a
suspension of Nafion and CB[8]. The nature of interaction
with CB[8] in the construction of this system, however, has not
been studied and remains unclear. Investigations with common
interferents such as acetylcholine (ACh), ascorbic acid (Asc),
and different amino acids, namely, D-phenylalanine (Phe), Ltyrosine (L-Tyr) or L-cysteine (L-Cys), arginine (Arg), and
lysine (Lys), showed that Phe, Arg, and Lys exhibited a
decrease in the electrochemical signal when present at a
minimum of 5-fold concentrations to that of Trp, while L-Tyr
could be determined simultaneously with the concentration of
Trp. The system was also shown to work in human serum, but
there remains room for improvement in the reproducibility for
real-life applications.


8.4. Characterization of CB[n] Host−Guest Binding on
Surfaces
In the systems involving CB[n] and surfaces, the binding
properties of the CB[n] is usually studied in solution and it is
assumed that CB[n] retains its molecular recognition behavior
on surfaces. However, with the availability of sophisticated tools
such as force spectroscopy, these interactions can now be
quantified down to the single-molecule level even on surfaces.
For example, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to
measure the rupture force between individual host−guest
complexes of CB[6] covalently tethered on gold substrates and
a spermine-functionalized AFM tip.250 A rupture force value of
120 pN was obtained for this system. In another study, the
interactions between self-assembled monolayers of CB[7] and
neutral adamantyl guests have been resolved at the singlemolecule level using dynamic force spectroscopy.251 It is noted
from such studies that the close proximity of a surface does not
appear to significantly alter CB[n] molecular recognition
properties. Furthermore, the spontaneous adsorption of
CB[6] and CB[7] on gold has been compared by AFM.252
8.5. Outlook
Direct interactions between CB[n] and gold continues to show
progress in self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles and sensing
applications, particularly in SERS-based applications. The
tunability of these systems is one of their major advantages,
where the probe can be adapted to the sample. Nonetheless,
there remains a need to further explore and elucidate the
interactions of CB[n] with gold on planar surfaces, which may
be possible with advances in techniques like AFM and STM. It
should also be noted that nanoparticles that have been
synthesized using CB[n] as the capping ligand are limited in
their size to below ∼10 nm in diameter. While nanoparticles
with small diameters might be exceptionally suited for catalysis,
larger nanoparticles are much more applicable in plasmonics.
As it is evident from the wide variety of systems being
reported, formation of covalent links between CB[n] and the
surfaces is moving fast toward interesting applications.
However, these strategies still often require time-consuming
prefunctionalized CB[n]. Therefore, the use of host−guest
interactions to immobilize CB[6] and CB[8] on surfaces
continues to be a promising strategy where irreversibility is
desirable.


9. SUPRAMOLECULAR POLYMERS
CB[n] supramolecular polymers can be divided into two areas:
(a) small-molecule-based supramolecular polymers and (b)
CB-mediated bridging of polymer chains and other macromolecular structures. There are a number of excellent reviews
in the area of CB[n] supramolecular polymers and the more
general host−guest driven polymerization.253−258 In this
section, we focus on summarizing the current status of research
and development toward CB[n]-supramolecular polymers and
highlight some relevant examples in the field, largely dominatedby CB[8] complexes, which has attracted increasing interest in
recent years.
9.1. Small-Molecule-Based Supramolecular Polymers
The construction of CB[n] noncovalent polymers based on low
molecular weight monomers is analogous to a polycondensation reaction259−261 and involves the binding of small-molecule
guest molecules through CB[n] host−guest interactions where
CB[n] acts mainly as a “molecular handcuff” holding together
the repeating units of the supramolecular polymer. There exist
several design parameters that must be considered in order to
produce systems that take full advantage of the properties of
CB[n] and generate dynamic polymeric constructs with
controlled molecular weight and structure.
The degree of association of supramolecular moieties is
strongly affected by both their concentration in solution and
their equilibrium constant and is approximately proportional to
(Keq·C)1/2.262 Therefore, both the concentration and the
binding strength between the repeating units have to be high
in order to achieve a high degree of polymerization. The
solubility of CB[n] and their complexes varies largely across
this family of host moleculesCB[5] and CB[7] are much
more water soluble than CB[6] and CB[8]15−and depends on
a number of parameters including solvent, temperature, ionic
strength, and guest. The majority of investigations on CB[n]
supramolecular polymers involve CB[8] complexes, which
typically exhibit a limited solubility in water. The advantages
afforded by the high binding constants of CB[n] complexes,
however, supersede the potential drawbacks from low water
solubility.
Another key consideration associated with such dynamic
systems is the formation of macrocycles and the presence of
ring−chain or ring−ring equilibria, which will impact the size of
the polymeric aggregates that can be obtained.263−265 As with
all equilibrium polymerization, a percentage of the chains will
be cyclized and the distribution of rings vs linear chains will
depend on a number of factors including monomer shape,
length, flexibility, strength of the binding motif, concentration,
and temperature.
The third consideration is related to the binding mode
between repeating units. There is a myriad of “complementary”
or “self-complementary” binding motifs that have been utilized
for the preparation of supramolecular polymers.262 Complementary motifs can be either two-component or threecomponent, whereby a third moiety is required for association.
Some metal−ligand systems including 2,6-di(2-pyridyl)pyridine
and 1,10-phenanthroline constitute a three-component binding
whereby two moieties of the same type are complexed by a
single metal ion. Indeed, metal−ligand interactions have been
widely exploited and afforded a facile synthesis of linear and
branched supramolecular polymers.266 CB[8] is a relatively
large member of the CB[n] family and can bind two organic
guests simultaneously. Kim and co-workers have shown that a
stable ternary charge-transfer complex between MV, as a first
guest, and 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene, as a second guest, readily
forms inside the cavity of CB[8].128 Furthermore, the ternary
complex is known to form in a stepwise manner with two subsequent equilibria. This three-component binding motif is
rather unique and reflects molecular recognition of complementary moieties in the presence of a macrocyclic host
molecule. In addition, CB[8] can also accommodate two
molecules of the same kind including coumarin,152 anthracenyl,136 and naphthyl156 derivatives. CB[10] and nor-seco-CB[10],
similarly to CB[8], can bind two organic guests simultaneously
inside their cavities, and their application in the area of aqueous
supramolecular polymerization, although with limited success,
has also been explored.267,268 Nevertheless, it is without a doubt
that progress in creating novel CB[n]-mediated polymers has
been so far strongly tied to the discovery of new CB[8]
complexes and novel guest design. A facile route to smallmolecule CB[8] guest polymerization involves the covalent
attachment of a first guest to a second guest moiety.
Alternatively, a monomer equipped with two moieties that
can be dimerized inside CB[8] can also yield linear polymeric
structures. A third option is based on an equimolar mixture of
two complementary divalent monomersfirst and second
guest dimers. We next summarize recent research efforts in the
area of CB[8] supramolecular polymers.



Kim and co-workers were the first to investigate the host−
guest complex formation between CB[8] and a guest molecule
having both a first and a second guest moiety connected by an
organic linker. Several types of supramolecular assemblies were
obtained by this process depending on the length and flexibility
of the linker between the binding moieties. It was reported that
the long and flexible trimethylene linker of D1 favors 1:1
complexation with CB[8] (Figure 28).269 A similar result was
obtained for the apparently more rigid but-2-enyloxy linker of
D2 (Figure 28). The introduction of an even more rigid pxylylene linker D3 in Figure 28 effectively prevented 1:1
complexation inside CB[8] but failed in promoting chain
extension as only a 2:2 complex was produced.270 When CB[8]
and monomer D4 were mixed in equimolar amounts (2 mM,
aqueous solution) a mixture of a 2:2 complex and oligomeric
species (3:2 ratio) was produced.271 The hydrodynamic volume
of the oligomeric, likely cyclic, species was estimated by
diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy, and a degree of polymerization of ca. 4 was proposed. Linear supramolecular polymers
were successfully grown from a gold surface functionalized with
dipyridyliumylethylene units. A surface-anchored poly-
(pseudorotaxane) was grown by soaking the functional gold
surface in an aqueous solution of CB[8] and monomer D4 (1
mM, water). After a 1 day incubation period, the poly-
(pseudorotaxane) reached a degree of polymerization of 4. The
surface-anchored poly(pseudorotaxane) was characterized by
surface plasmon resonance and atomic force microscopy
images. Monomer D5 contains a naphthalene and a
dipyridyliumylethylene unit connected by a methylene bridge.
Although the short linker prevents intramolecular complexation, the structural design again promotes cyclization rather
than linear polymer formation. An equimolar mixture of CB[8]
and D5 resulted in a stable cyclic pentamer comprising five
CB[8] molecules and five guest molecules.272
In order to circumvent cyclization, Zhang and co-workers
designed a monomer containing up to four CB[8] binding sites
in a single monomeric structure. The structure of such a
monomer contains two central viologen moieties and two
terminal anthracene groups, providing what was called a
“double handcuff” to hold repeating units together (D6 in
Figure 28).273 The short methylene linker between the
anthracene and the viologen moieties avoids intramolecular
complexation, while the pair of central viologens effectively
prevents the formation of 2:2 complexesthe positively
charged viologens will sit too close to each other in a cyclic
2:2 complex. When CB[8] was mixed with D6 in a 1:1 ratio the
appearance of a charge-transfer band evidenced heteroternary
complex formation. The 1:1 stoichiometry of the complex was
corroborated by Job’s plot analysis. AFM-based single-molecule
force spectroscopy analysis showed the formation of extended
polymer chains. The force curves of the supramolecular
polymer were similar to traditional macromolecules, and a
Kuhn and chain length of ca. 2.2 and 60.0 nm, respectively,
were determined [comparatively, the Kuhn length for DNA in
water274 and poly(tert-butyl methacrylate)275 in toluene are
approximately 100 and 2 nm, respectively]. Dynamic light
scattering experiments provided further evidence of polymer
formation, with the Rh of the chains determined to be on the
order of 30 nm.
Inspired by the previous monomer design proposed,
Scherman and co-workers investigated an analogous guest
structure equipped with azobenzene instead of anthracene
moieties (D7 in Figure 28). The formation of supramolecular
polymers was charaterized both in solution and in the solid
state through a combination of dynamic and static light
scattering and synchrotron SAXS and SANS, see Figure 29.276
Interestingly, the shorter monomer D8 can also form relatively
long linear structures in solution, which coexist with the more
stable 2:2 complex. These polymers can be readily depolymerized by UV light irradiation as the E-azobenzene moieties
isomerize into the Z-isomer that fully occupies the CB[8] cavity
with a high binding constant. The formation of a 1:1 complex
between CB[8] and Z-azobenzene was investigated in solution
by ITC and NMR. Additionally, single crystals of the polymeric
structure were obtained and analyzed by X-ray crystallography.
This light-controlled formation of CB[8] complexes is
substantially different to other light-actuated host−guest
systems and may find applications in biological and materials
sciences.


Zhang and co-workers investigated the formation of
supramolecular polymers based on a wide variety of homotopic
divalent monomers containing self-complementary CB[8]
binding moieties including naphthalene, anthracene, phenylalanine, and quaternized azastilbene groups (see D9−D13 in
Figure 28).277−280 These moieties readily dimerized inside the
cavity of CB[8], thus promoting polymerization. Monomers
D9 and D10 contain two naphthalene moieties in close
proximity to positively charged quaternary amines.278 The flat
aromatic groups can form host−guest enhanced π−π
complexes in the presence of CB[8], and the positive charges
ensure the water solubility of the final polymer and further
stabilization through ion−dipole interactions with the ureidyl
carbonyl portals. While D9 only formed cyclic oligomeric
species in the presence of CB[8], D10 resulted in long, linear
polymeric structures. This was attributed to the rigid, shapepersistent 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium linker, which
can effectively inhibit cyclization. The degrees of polymerization estimated by DOSY NMR spectroscopy were on the
order of 64 for the polymer based on D10 and 7 for the
oligomeric species derived from D9 (1 mM, water), thus
highlighting the crucial role of the monomer spacer. The same
group nevertheless showed that other monomers D12 and D13
(Figure 28) with much longer and flexible linkers than D10 can
also polymerize. One interesting example is provided by the
comparison of monomers D13 and D14. Zhang and coworkers investigated the supramolecular polymerization of D13
in the presence of CB[8] based on MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry and AFM-based single-molecule force spectroscopy. Both techniques evidenced the formation of polymers
with a degree of polymerization on the order of 20−60.
Dankers and co-workers recently investigated the binding
properties of D14 through a combination of ITC, DOSY NMR
spectroscopy, and QTOF and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
and found no evidence of polymer formation.281 Data suggests
that ring−chain equilibrium is in fact fully directed to ring
formation (1:1 complex). The formation of this complex can by
described by an overall binding constant Kring = 9.0 × 106 M−1
and an effective concentration of 750 μM. The well-defined
ring structure of the cyclic dimer D14·CB[8], with a high
equilibrium constant, provided a very efficient inhibition
mechanism for CB[8] protein dimerization processes as it
can readily displace phenylalanine-containing peptide sequences from different proteins.282 MALDI-TOF analysis of CB[8]
polymers from both D13 and D14 revealed peaks at high
molecular weight, which were attributed to supramolecular
polymer formation by Zhang and co-workers, whereas Dankers
and co-workers ascribed them to CB[8] aggregates artifacts.
The concept of CB[8] homoternary complexation has also
been expanded toward the preparation of hyperbranched
polymer structures, networks, and 2D polymer networks from
monomers equipped with at least 3 binding sites (D15, D16,
and D18 in Figure 28).283−287 It is noteworthy that, again, the
flexibility of the monomer will determine the final structure of
the polymers; monomers with flexible linkers (D15 and D16)
will result in hyperbranched polymers, whereas 2D networks
are produced from the more rigid monomer D18.


Another interesting concept consists of exploiting CB[8]-
enhanced radical dimerization as a driving force in supramolecular polymerization. Kim and co-workers reported in
2002 that methyl viologen binds to CB[8] in 1:1 stoichiometry
with a binding constant on the order of 105 M−1.142 When
methyl viologen is reduced to the radical cation, a 1:2 complex
is formed exclusively. The apparent binding constant for the
dimerization process is on the order of 107 M−1. This
homoternary complex is extraordinarily stable on account of
extensive ion−dipole interactions between the ureidyl carbonyl
portals of CB[8] and MV•+. In addition, the host provides the
dimer with a hydrophobic cavity of the right size to host the
couple of radical cations. Thus, the presence of CB[8] affords a
convenient, simple, and reversible mechanism to drive selfassembly of a variety of organic moieties. Kaifer and co-workers
reported in 2004 that the complexation-enhanced dimerization
of viologen radical cations can be utilized to self-assemble
Newkome-type dendrons equipped with a MV moiety at their
focal point.288 Zhan-Ting Li, Yi Liu, and co-workers recently
described the formation of 2D supramolecular organic
frameworks from shape-persistent viologen-containing trimers
(monomers D19 and D20).286 The viologen moieties of the
trimers can be easily reduced in the presence of sodium
dithionite, thus inducing self-association in water. The reduced
trimer D19 stacks strongly in a face-to-face fashion, forming discrete 2 + 3 complexes with CB[8]. However, the presence of
the bulky bis(2-hydroxyethyl) carbamoyl groups of D20 avoids
face-to-face stacking, thus leading, after reduction, to the
formation of a single-layer 2D supramolecular organic framework, which is stabilized by the strong complexation of CB[8].
The new supramolecular networks were characterized by UV/
vis absorption, EPR, DLS, as well as solution and solid-phase
small-angle X-ray diffraction experiments. The single-layer
feature of the network was confirmed by AFM imaging as the
average thickness of the supramolecular framework was
consistent with the diameter of CB[8]. Analogous monomeric
trimers derived from 4,4-bipyridin-1-ium (monomers D17 and
D18) also self-assemble in the presence of CB[8] in a similar
fashion to the previously described reduced trimers, Figure
30.287
In 2004, Kim and co-workers described the first stable π
dimer of a tetrathiafulvalene radical cation encapsulated inside
the cavity of CB[8].289 This was demonstrated through a
combination of NMR, UV/vis, and EPR spectroscopies. TTF
binds to CB[8] and is simultaneously oxidized to the radical
cation species forming a stable three-component complex as a
red precipitate. Although no quantitative binding study was
performed, this work demonstrated the effectiveness of CB[8]
in stabilizing unstable species through molecular encapsulation.
TTF radical dimerization has been shown to be extremely
useful in exerting redox control over a wide variety of polymeric
structures and mechanically interlocked constructs.290−294
However, supramolecular polymer formation driven by
encapsulation of the TTF radical cation inside the cavity of
CB[8] has not been realized yet.


Supramolecular polymers constructed by orthogonal selfassembly based on host−guest, including CB[n]s, and other
dynamic covalent/noncovalent interactions are attracting
increasing attention.295,296 Kim and co-workers pioneered the
area CB[n] orthogonal self-assembly by designing a wide
variety of metal−organic CB[n] polyrotaxanes.297 One of these
structures consists of a pseudorotaxaneprepared by a simple
mixture of D21 and CB[6]that yields a linear polymer in the
presence of Cu2+ through pyridine−metal-ion coordination.298
A polycatenated 2D polyrotaxane net is formed, however, if Ag+
is used instead of Cu2+.299 The same strategy combined with a
more complex ligand D22 produces double-chained and zigzagshaped 1D polyrotaxanes in the presence of Cd2+ and Co2+.300
The repeating units of these metal−organic structures are held
together by metal−ligand, not host−guest, interactions;
however, the CB[n] complex plays a crucial role as it imparts
rigidity to the organic linker. More recently, Zhang and coworkers investigated the preparation of CB[8] supramolecular
polymers through a combination of host−guest and terpyridine−Fe2+ interactions.301 Monomer D23 is a heteroditopic
molecule consisting of a naphthalene and terpyridine moiety
which can be dimerized in the presence of Fe2+, forming a
monomer with two terminal naphthalene moieties, [Fe·
D232]2+. This new metal-containing monomer can undergo
polymerization when mixed with an equimolar amount of
CB[8] in a similar fashion to monomer D10. It was claimed
that the cationic metallic center enhances the water solubility of
the complex while serving as a rigid spacer between the CB[8]
binding sites. Masson and co-workers further explored this
concept and demonstrated that Coulombic interactions
between metal centers and CB[n] can actually be mediated
by an organic ligand and showed that, even in the second
coordination sphere, CB[n] form strong CH···O hydrogen
bonds with the ligand surrounding the metallic core.302 This
recognition process is driven by a combination of favorable
enthalpies (up to 20.2 kcal·mol−1) and very unfavorable
entropic contributions (as low as −10.2 kcal·mol−1). The
recognition properties of the metal−ligand complexes were
extended to CB[8], and dynamic supramolecular oligomers
were prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of ligand D24 and
CB[8] in the presence of Fe2+ and Ir3+. The approximate
degrees of polymerization of the oligomers, based on DOSY
NMR spectroscopy, were 11 and 54 for the Fe2+ and Ir3+
polymers (1 mM, water). CB[8] can also encapsulate 2,3,5,6-
tetrafluorophenyl units, and supramolecular oligomers were
also produced when mixing [Fe·D252]2+ and [Ir·D252]3+ with
CB[8] in equimolar amounts (Figure 28). Degrees of
polymerization of 27 and 15 were estimated for the Fe2+ and
Ir3+ polymers, respectively. Also, social self-sorting was
observed for an equimolar mixture of ([Fe·D242]2+·CB[8])n
and ([Ir·D252]3+·CB[8])n, thus generating well-defined
oligomers with alternating Fe2+ and Ir3+ cationic centers,
Figure 31. The preference for naphthyl−tetrafluorophenyl
pairing was attributed to favorable quadrupole−quadrupole
interactions in a similar fashion to those present in benzene−
perfluorobenzene pairs.303,304 In addition to metal−organic
interactions, other types of dynamic covalent chemistries have
been combined with CB[8] host−guest interactions to produce
linear supramolecular polymers. These include thiol−disulfide,
diselenides, and cyclodextrin host−guest interactions (monomers D26−D28 in Figure 28).305−307 D28, as an example,
comprises an azobenzene moiety covalently attached to a
phenylalanine residue. The monomer can dimerize in the
presence of CB[8] to form a 2:1 D282·CB[8] complex, which
can undergo subsequent polymerization when mixed with an
equimolar amount of a β-cyclodextrin dimer.


The concept of CB[8]-mediated phenylalanine dimerization
was also exploited by Liu and co-workers in the design and
synthesis of protein polymers.308 In this case, a homodimer
glutathione S-transferase was selected as the building block for genetic fusion with phenylalanine-glycine-glycine oligopeptides
at each side of its N-termini. The homodimer protein
polymerizes via homoternary complex formation between two
phenylalanine residues and CB[8] as demonstrated by the
increase of the molecular weight of the aggregate. The proteinbased polymer had a wire-shaped structure with an average
length of 128 nm (degree of polymerization around 25) and a
height of about 4.8 nm. This protein assembly was highly stable
and could even undergo separation by gel permeation
chromatography and further functionalization with glutathione
peroxidase.
Finally, Zhang and co-workers recently reported a novel
polymerization methodology controlled by CB[8] and CB[7]
self-sorting.309 The supramolecular polymerization of a
tetracationic monomer composed of p-phenylene and naphthalene moieties was promoted by the selective recognition of
the central p-phenylene ring by CB[7] followed by a CB[8]
naphthalene double encapsulation. A degree of polymerization
of ca. 28 was obtained by asymmetric flow field flow
fractionation (that conveniently bypasses the use of GPC
stationary phases) coupled to multiangle light scattering.


9.2. CB[8]-Mediated Supramolecular Block
Copolymerization
Not only is supramolecular polymerization possible by CB[8]
complexation of small molecules, higher molecular weight
molecules such as polymers can also be complexed at their
termini or via side chains to other polymers, small molecules,
biomolecules, etc. As the following section will demonstrate,
this process can lead to large and facile increases in molecular
weight, not only affording chain-extended polymers. However,
by relying on the specific heteroternary 1:1:1 CB[8]-stabilized
charge-transfer complex, self-sorted amphiphilic supramolecular
block copolymers can be produced allowing formation of
micelles and vesicles that can be assembled, disassembled, and
reassembled using various stimuli-responsive triggers.
9.2.1. Supramolecular Assembly of Macromolecules.
Kaifer and co-workers first demonstrated macromolecular
assembly with CB[8] by centrally and noncovalently complexing two distinct dendrimers, one functionalized with MV
(electron acceptor) and a second with p-dialkoxybenzene
(electron donor).131 In this study, dendrimers were selectively
assembled on account of the guest covalently attached, and the
efficiency of this process was shown to be dependent on the
size of the corresponding dendritic units. Electrochemical oneelectron reduction of viologen resulted in homodimerization of
dendrimer units on account of 2:1 complexation of the MV
radical cations to CB[8], and therefore, redox switching
between discrete molecular weight dynamic dendrimer dimers
was possible.
A facile methodology of block copolymerization by supramolecular complexation is that of the dimerization of MVterminated polymers to Np-terminated polymers by CB[8]
addition, Figure 32.310 This leads to the formation of linear
dynamic elongated homopolymers and AB-diblock copolymers,
as demonstrated by Scherman and co-workers. Dynamic
amphiphilic polymers of PEG and cis-1,4-poly(isoprene) or
octadecane were prepared, and these were also able to form
larger vesicular structures in a highly versatile manner.
Ji and co-workers reported similar aqueous structures of a
linear hyperbranched polyphosphate with a terminal MV unit
that complexed to CB[8] and poly(D,L-lactide) with terminal
indole units.311 This formed an amphiphilic block copolymer
structure that would assemble into a biocompatible micellar
structure. Disassembly of these micelles was possible by
reduction of the MV units with sodium dithionite, breaking
the heteroternary complex.
Actual polymeric chain extension by CB[8] complexation at
polymer termini was investigated by Jiang and co-workers,
Figure 33a.312 Low molecular weight poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) with naphthyl
moieties at both termini were synthesized via reversible
addition−fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT). These polymers were then combined in solution with a viologen dimer
and CB[8] to form host-stabilized charge-transfer complexes
and higher molecular weight supramolecular polymers from the
lower molecular weight building blocks. The existence of these
higher molecular weight supramolecular polymers was observed
using viscometry techniques. The resultant supramolecular
pNIPAm also expressed interesting LCST behavior, which was
strongly dependent on concentration (higher concentrations are associated with lower LCSTs), unlike covalent pNIPAm,
which exhibits very limited concentration dependence on its
critical temperature.


Not only is supramolecular complexation possible at the
polymer terminus, indeed Scherman and co-workers also
demonstrated the reversible and stimuli-responsive loading of
side chains onto hydrophilic polymer chains by utilizing CB[8]
ternary complexation motifs.313 A copolymer of oligoethylene
glycol acrylate and a naphthol-bound monomer was synthesized via RAFT polymerization. MV derivatives were then
reversibly complexed to the naphthol residues. In particular,
MV-bound hydrophobic residues such as C18 chains could be
“pulled” into aqueous solution using this complexation method.
Upon addition of sodium dithionite, the MV moieties were
reduced from dicationic species to radical cations, breaking the
1:1:1 heteroternary complexes. This process was in turn
reversible by bubbling air through the solution, oxidizing the
MV and regenerating the charge-transfer complexes. This work
holds design features amenable to controlled or triggered
release delivery devices. Monosaccharides and multivalent
ligand−lectins have similarly been noncovalently attached to
such copolymers to add biorecognition modalities.314 A
supramolecular glycopolymer was produced, which could
bind lectins and then be released from the copolymer backbone
using redox methods. Such polymer designs could be further
used to probe cellular activity and biomarkers. Development of
this area has led to the development of drug delivery
applications with both Scherman and Ji reporting the delivery
of doxorubicin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic, from
supramolecular micellar structures. In both cases, CB[8]
heteroternary complexation was employed to form supramolecular amphiphilic block copolymers, which would in turn
form micelles through hydrophobic interactions, Figure
33b.315,316 Scherman and co-workers constructed triply
stimuli-responsive micelles from temperature- and chemoresponsive CB[8], pH-responsive naphthalene-terminated poly-
(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA-Np), and
temperature-responsive MV-terminated poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm-MV). Mixing these components in
aqueous solution in an equimolar ratio resulted in micelle
formation in which doxorubicin was encapsulated. Changes in
pH and temperature or addition of the competitive guest,
adamantylamine, resulted in disassembly of the micelles and
release of doxorubicin, which was shown to have a direct effect
on cell viability. Moreover, exposed cell lines exhibited good
tolerance of the doxorubicin-loaded micelles, only exhibiting
detrimental effects upon triggered release. Ji and co-workers
reported a similar assembly of micelles utilizing a different
heteroternary supramolecular motif. In this example, the
hydrophobic block consisted of an indole-terminated poly-
(lactic acid) whereby indole is an electron-rich moiety utilized
in the charge-transfer handcuff motif. The hydrophilic block
consisted of MV-terminated PEO. Furthermore, both poly-
(ethylene oxide) and poly(lactic acid) have been FDA
approved for medical use, and the latter also has an excellent
biodegradability profile. Again, doxorubicin encapsulation was
possible within the hydrophobic core of the micelle, and release
could be triggered by addition of sodium dithionite, reducing
the MV and causing disassembly.
Indeed, supramolecular assembly of higher order structures is
not limited to micelles, and the aqueous construction of
double-layer vesicles was also reported by Scherman and coworkers in 2012.317 Assembly of a pyrene-GGGKKK peptide
with a MV−lipid through host−guest ternary complexation
with CB[8] afforded 200 nm spherical double-layered vesicles,
observed by DLS and TEM. Furthermore, these vesicles were
readily absorbed by cells, and fluorescence imaging of the cells
could be achieved by uptake of either 1,6-dihydroxynaphthalene
or adamantylamine to break the ternary complex, releasing the
fluorescent pyrene−peptide. Supramolecular polymeric analogues of these vesicles (Figure 33b) are pertinent for use as
delivery devices of large biomolecules, in particular, basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).318 These vesicles protected
bFGF against several freeze−thaw cycles and were effective
delivery devices to cells, therefore showing good promise as an
injectable therapy. Das and co-workers expanded work in this area to form mixed micelles of viologen amphiphiles and
tetralkylammonium salts in water. These micelles could then be
transformed into vesicles through host−guest complexation
with CB[8].319 Furthermore, the rearrangement of these mixed
micelles into vesicles was mechanistically studied, appearing to
progress through a stable mixed-micelle stage; upon addition of
CB[8], a dynamic mixture of nonspherical mixed micelles is
formed, and then on addition of naphthalene-derived guests,
the micelles structurally promoted into self-sorted vesicles.320
9.2.2. Conclusion and Outlook. Supramolecular block
copolymerization is an exciting area with ongoing development
of facile routes toward producing multiply responsive materials.
From mechanistic studies of formation to advancement into
bioapplicable delivery of growth factors, this area is undergoing
new and extensive investigation. Supramolecular block
copolymer materials are now poised for use in real-life
applications, and we hope to see in vivo progression in the
near future.


10. MOLECULAR RECOGNITION IN 3D
SUPRAMOLECULAR NETWORKS
Hydrogels are becoming an important class of material on
account of their high water content, tunable properties, and
biocompatibility. In the example of polymeric hydrogels, water
is encapsulated within a chemically or physically cross-linked
macroscopic network by capillary forces and their stiffness and
elasticity defined by polymer loading and cross-link density.
Hydrogels formed via molecular recognition of CB[n] for
specific chemical motifs pendant from polymer chains have
become increasingly widely studied since 2010. The fabrication
of such soft materials has been reviewed specifically in recent
years, perhaps however prematurely, as the field of CB[n]
cross-linked hydrogels is still developing.133−135 In the
following examples, exploiting the host−guest complexes of
CB[6], CB[7], and CB[8] to form physical polymer−polymer
cross-links will be discussed and how the dynamics and control
over such cross-linking has been investigated and utilized.
10.1. CB[8] Complexes Cross-Link Guest Functional
Polymers
Scherman and co-workers extensively explored the formation of
CB[8]-stabilized charge-transfer complexes between electronpoor and electron-rich species that are covalently bound to
polymers. The random attachment of first and second guests,
methyl viologen (MV) and naphthoxy (Np), respectively, to a
variety of independent synthetic polymers was first achieved
through the copolymerization of guest-bound monomers with
either neutral, cationic, or anionic monomers in a ratio of
1:10.321 Upon addition of CB[8] to a mixture of MV−polymer
and Np−polymer (5 wt %) in water, viscoelastic materials were
formed that expressed a responsiveness to stress and shear on
account of the formation of multiple noncovalent ternary
complexes between polymers, Figure 34. Moreover, this work
also demonstrates a wide tolerance of charge on the formation
of hydrogels through the CB[8] recognition motif through the
utility of a variety of anionic and cationic polymers, as well as
the appearance of viscoelastically tunable supramolecular
networks through controlled CB[8] concentration.
Scherman and co-workers continued their exploration of
these materials, focusing on the ability to form a predominantly
elastic material with minimal polymer content (0.5 wt %).322
To achieve this a high molecular weight polysaccharide,
hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC, MW = 1.3 MDa) was functionalized with Np moieties to a degree of 5 mol %. The resulting
material was then combined in solution with CB[8] and a high
molecular weight commodity polymer poly(vinyl alcohol)
(PVA, Mn = 1.5 MDa) functionalized with MV. It was found
that a range of soft material properties could be achieved and
were accessible simply by modifying polymer loading.
Impressively, a broad spectrum of storage moduli spanning 2
orders of magnitude (10 > G′ > 1000) could be readily
attained. Moreover, these materials were also shown to have
excellent shear-thinning properties (resulting from the very low
polymer loadings and noncovalent cross-linking) and also
exhibited rapid self-healing behavior. The authors exemplified
this by performing step-shear rheology experiments and
demonstrated the viscosity of the material returned within seconds upon release of the high shear rates and that the
process was also recyclable. Rapid recognition of Np-HEC by
CB[8]⊂MV-PVA complexes upon relaxation of the material
facilitates healing, whereby the dissociated complexes are
quickly reassociated under mechanical stimuli rather than the
actual breaking and making of any covalent bonds, and so the
properties are always 100% restored.


Furthermore, the release of small (lysozyme) and large
(BSA) proteins from the HEC hydrogels has also been
demonstrated.323 In this example, polymer concentration was
altered in order to modulate the mesh size of the supramolecular network. By raising the polymer content, the mesh
size was decreased and the proteins could be released at slower
rates. Specifically, in the case of a 1.5 wt % HEC gel, BSA
release was sustained for 160 days, showing excellent utility for
these materials as biomedical delivery devices.
Modification of the system to use the polysaccharride chitin
afforded hydrogel materials that were antimicrobial; however,
they have found utility as a consolidant for archeological wood
conservation, specifically on the Mary Rose, a 16th Century
warship.324 By adding extra CB[8] binding moieties onto the
chitin backbone, such as naphthalene and dopamine derivatives,
a system was produced that could not only gelate and express
all previous properties of such supramolecular hydrogels but
also complex Fe3+ ions that persist in the water-logged artifacts.
This system is therefore pulled into the porous wooden
artifacts, strengthening them and “locking” the iron in place,
preventing its transport and therefore further degradation as
well as providing biocidal protection.
Focusing on further improving CB[8] hydrogel utility in the
biomedical field, harnessing 2:1 binding of amino acids to
CB[8] was also investigated as a route to hydrogel
formation.325 Scherman and co-workers demonstrated hydrogel
formation with synthetic cationic styrenic polymers bearing
either phenylalanine or tryptophan derivatives, Figure 35a. It
was shown that phenylalanine 2:1 complexation to CB[8]
afforded much stronger hydrogels than the tryptophan-derived
polymers and that the material properties could be tuned by
controlling CB[8] content and therefore cross-link density.
This system is inherently simpler than the previous hydrogels as
the network is only comprised of two components, a
multivalent amino acid bearing polymer and CB[8], opposed
to two different polymers (one bearing the first guest and the
other the second guest) and CB[8]. However, the authors
found that rigid polymers were required to form hydrogels as
this prevented intrachain complexation of CB[8], as previously
observed when polymers containing both first and second guest
formed soft nanoparticles on addition of CB[8].326 In the
future, the authors look to apply these amino acid recognition
motifs to larger and more biomedically relevant polymers to
improve water content and biocompatibility further.
A second example of 2:1 guest to CB[8] binding facilitating
hydrogel formation was reported by Lin and co-workers in
2013, Figure 35b.327 Here, N-(4-dimethylaminobenzyl)chitosan
(EBCS) was shown to form hydrogels of a variety of strengths
upon addition of CB[8] under various pH conditions, allowing
for control of release rates of the model drug cargo 5-
fluorouracil. In this case, hydrogelation likely occurs through
recognition and affinity of the protonated aminobenzyl groups
by the ureido−carbonyl portals of CB[8]. Due to protonation
of the aminobenzyl groups being a necessity, weak hydrogels
were formed at pH 6.8 and strengthened at lower pH levels.
Therefore, the facility to use this material in biomedical
applications is quite restricted; however, pH control over
specific recognition of aminobenzyl-derived moieties has been
clearly demonstrated.
A further photoresponsive hydrogel construct from the
Scherman group was reported in 2014. In this study, CB[8]-
catalyzed photodimerization of anthracene in water was
exploited in hydrogel formation, Figure 35c.45 In this system, the anthracene-derived moieties form 2:1 inclusion complexes
with CB[8] and were conjugated to an HEC backbone via a
copper-accelerated cycloaddition to azide-derived HEC. The
2:1 anthracene:CB[8] complexation alone afforded elastic soft
materials. Upon photoirradiation at 350 nm for 15 min the
material experienced a hardening effect and the moduli roughly
tripled in magnitude, accounted for by the covalent
dimerization of the two anthracene moieties within the
CB[8], resulting in the HEC network becoming covalently
cross-linked. The presence of CB[8] within the system was
shown to rapidly catalyze the formation of the anthracene
dimers as irradiation of the same material in the absence of
CB[8] did not yield materials of the same strength.
Unfortunately, the dimerization of anthracene in this system
was not shown to be reversible, so the hydrogelation via this
photochemical CB[8]-catalyzed cross-linking process is a
seemingly permanent conversion.


10.2. Dynamics of Cross-Linking Influences Material
Properties
The nature of microscopic thermodynamic properties of
physical cross-links within a supramolecular network can have
a large impact on the material. Recognition of different smallmolecule motifs by CB[8] in hydrogel formation thus has a
great effect on the resulting hydrogel. In 2014, Scherman and
co-workers explored the nature of the CB[8] ternary complex
cross-linking motif and how the dynamic complexation of such
motifs contributes toward defining hydrogel viscoelastic
behavior.328 Investigation of different second guests beyond
Np that have slightly different energetic binding properties to
CB[8]⊂MV was undertaken, Figure 34. The other second
guests studied alongside Np were dibenzylfuran (DBF) and
pyrene (Pyr), which have very similar overall equilibrium
constants in the formation of the heteroternary complexes with
CB[8]·MV (1.5, 1.4, and 1.3 × 104 M−1, respectively),
determined by stopped-flow fluorescence experiments. Despite
these seemingly similar equilibrium constants, the activation
energies of dissociation (Ead) of the second guest were found to
be vastly different (Np 30 kJ mol−1, DBF 54 kJ mol−1, Pyr 89 kJ
mol−1). Physically cross-linked materials were prepared from
multivalent poly(dimethylacrylamide) bearing one of the
second guests, polystyrene-MV and CB[8]. Remarkably, all
materials were found to have virtually identical X-ray scattering
profiles; however, frequency-dependent oscillatory rheology
showed that the Pyr gels were the “most elastic” and the Np
gels the least. This was attributed to the dissociative rates of the
second guest. The authors showed that when scaling the
rheology data with the value of Ead for each second guest, the
measured frequency-dependent rheology profiles overlaid
almost exactly. Therefore, the strength and viscoelastic property
of the hydrogels is not only dependent on conventional
polymer physics and polymer interactions but also dependent
on the dynamics of cross-linking, in particular, the choice of
second guest used in the CB[8] ternary complex cross-linking
motif, and specifically dependent on the Ead of the second
guest. In simpler terms, higher dissociative barriers of the
second guest affords longer cross-link lifetimes and therefore
stronger materials.
In a subsequent study, Scherman and co-workers investigated
how the dynamics of physical cross-linking in these systems
affect release of rhodamine from the supramolecular network.329 Higher release constants were observed for materials
bearing second guests with lower Ead values. This was
accounted for through faster cross-link dynamics, allowing
faster diffusive rates of solvent and cargo in and out of the gel
network. Faster cross-link dynamics also led to faster erosion
rates of the hydrogels as water is able to diffuse into the
hydrogel easier, facilitating erosion through swelling mechanisms. By studying these phenomena, erosive and diffusive
mechanistic contributions to rhodamine release could be
understood, and material lifetimes are now potentially
predictable. This study demonstrates that cross-link dynamics
play a subtle yet important role in release of cargo from
hydrogels and that the ability to robustly fine tune release and
erosive rates is possible.


10.3. Composite Soft Materials Utilizing CB[8] Host−Guest
Interactions
Collaboration between the Scherman and Ikkala groups
resulted in the development of soft domain−hard domain
composite hydrogels whereby homogeneous dispersions of
cellulose nanocrystals (hard domains, CNCs) were cross-linked
with soft polymeric domains via host−guest interactions
between MV, Np, and CB[8], Figure 36a.330 This was achieved by using CNCs decorated with surface ATRP initiator moieties
to graft methacrylate polymers bearing multiple Np units.
Mixing the functionalized CNCs with PVA−MV polymers and
CB[8] produced supramolecular materials that were 85% water,
extremely well structured as exemplified by frequency-dependent rheology, highly elastic (G′ ≫ G″), and rapidly self-healing
(healing time < 6 s). These are combined and desirable
properties of both hard and soft materials which would usually
be seen to be conflicting or unable to operate together in the
same material. Moreover, materials that were cut in half and
kept separate for 4 months were pushed back together and their
viscoelastic property completely restored after just a few
seconds. This property is remarkable in that the material was
not passivated even after months and did not require any
activation, something that had not been previously demonstrated in other supramolecular systems.
A follow-up study between the two groups led to the
development of a composite hydrogel of nanofibrillar cellulose
(NFC) and HEC, again supramolecularly cross-linked with
CB[8] host−guest interactions.331 More specifically, a supramolecular HEC network, cross-linked by heteroternary
complexation to CB[8], was adsorbed onto NFC colloidal
domains as a sacrificial yet self-healing network, connecting
stiffer NFC domains that would usually form stiff hydrogels
alone through crystalline fibril−fibril entanglements, Figure
36b. These crystalline domains however have little ability to
dissipate stress and as the materials are stiff allow for very little
yielding. By adsorbing a supramolecular network to bridge the
length scales between NFC colloidal domains, a soft material
was produced whereby the yield strain could be offset
dependent on the supramolecular content of such formulations,
and materials were also self-healing.
Scherman, Liu, and co-workers later reported a purely
supramolecular double-network hydrogel comprised of one
DNA-hybridized system and one CB[8] host−guest system,
Figure 36c.332 This work is particularly interesting because of
the multiple levels of stimuli responsiveness arising from the
two present networks including temperature, chemical,
mechanical, and enzymatic responses. By mixing carboxymethyl
cellulose-phe (CMC-phe), CB[8], and DNA motifs, interpenetrating networks were afforded that did not appear to have
any interaction as imaged by confocal microscopy; however, the
brittleness of the DNA gel was offset by the presence of the
interpenetrating CMC-phe/CB[8] dynamic system, which can
rapidly reorganize and heal on distortion. Ultimately, a system
was recognized that exhibited a higher than predicted
mechanical strength of the combined gels and also the selfhealing and rapid reorganization of CB[8] gels. The material
was also shown to be responsive to excess free phenylalanine,
which could compete for the CB[8] cavities, as well as having
full biodegradability profiles on account of enzyme addition
such as nuclease and cellulase. This material offers an
interesting opportunity to consider new 3D cell culture
scaffolds as well as injectable delivery devices for triggered
release of DNA motifs in novel therapies.


10.4. From Monohydroxylated-CB[n] to Functional
Materials
Kim and co-workers reported preparation of CB[6]-grafted
hyaluronic acid (HA) via reaction of thiol-modified HA (HASH) with (allyloxy)12CB[6].333 Hydrogels were formed when
HA functionalized with diaminohexane (DAH) was mixed with
HA−CB[6] as a result of the specific inclusion complexation of
the DAH to the CB[6] cavity. These hydrogels could be
returned to their sol state upon addition of spermine to the
material, which displaces the DAH moieties from the CB[6]
cavities based on having a 100-fold higher binding constant,
destroying the interchain cross-links, suggesting gelation is
promoted by CB[6]·DAH complexation. At 2 wt % polymer
loading, these hydrogels exhibited exceptionally high storage
moduli (∼2 kPa) and also reasonable biocompatibility. Any
remaining HA-DAH moieties were able to be capped with
further CB[6] derivatives that were tagged with biorelevant
molecules such as adhesion peptides and fluorescent markers
demonstrating utility in 3D cell culture and tissue engineering.
These hydrogels were later implicated in controlling
chondrogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells
(HMSCs).334 Here, spatial control of the HMSCs was achieved
by modulating cross-link density of the hydrogel by controlling
the amount of functionalization of HA with monoallyloxy−
CB[6] and differentiation of the cells controlled by release
profiles of transforming growth factors and dexamethasonebound CB[6] (Dexa-CB[6]). Dexa-CB[6] was shown to have
slower release rates from the gels in comparison to free dexamethasone (in the order of days compared to hours) on its
complexation to free DAH residues conjugated to the polymer
network.
Similarly to Kim’s work, promise of useful materials with
multiple anchored CB[7] molecules has also recently been
reported by Tan and co-workers.105 In this work, the synthesis
of a 4-vinylbenzyloxy−CB[7] monomer is reported followed by
the copolymerization with N-isopropylacrylamide (NiPAAm).
The authors found that they could copolymerize 0.86 mol % of
4-vinylbenzyloxy−CB[7] into NiPAAm using redox-initiated
polymerization in water with Mn = 2.10 × 105 Da and PDI of
1.69 while retaining thermoresponsive properties. Although no
specific materials were produced from this copolymer, a wide
variety of guest molecules were still able to bind to a proportion
of the CB[7] residues, even in their anchored form, and thus,
these materials could become useful in the construction of
higher order supramolecular materials or in surface attachment
applications.



10.5. Microcapsule Formation Through CB[8] Ternary
Complexation
CB[8] recognition motifs have also found utility in the
formation of synthetic microcapsules whereby complete control
of the composition of the shell and also the content is
paramount. Work by Scherman and co-workers saw development of multistimuli-responsive polymer−gold nanoparticle
composite materials held together by CB[8] heteroternary
complexes.335 The later developed, through collaboration
between Scherman, Abell, and co-workers, into composite
gold nanoparticle−polymer microcapsules produced by microfluidic methods, Figure 38a.336 Similarly to the formation of
supramolecular polymers and hydrogels, heteroternary complexation was achieved by encapsulation of an electron-deficient
first guest followed by complexation of an electron-rich second
guest. To control structure formation, separate aqueous
solutions of MV-functional gold nanoparticles, Np−copolymer,
and CB[8] were simultaneously injected into a microfluidic
device with a fluorous-oil carrier phase perpendicular to the
aqueous flow. As the oil and water phases meet, shear forces at
the interface initiate formation of monodisperse droplets whereby the Np−copolymer and MV−nanoparticles were
cross-linked at the oil−water interface by CB[8] (having
been drawn to the interface to stabilize the water/oil surface
energy), forming spherical capsules upon dehydration;
subsequent rehydration was carried out with minimal rupturing
of the 3D structures. The size of the microcapsules could also
be controlled by moderating the difference in flow rate between
the oil carrier phase and the aqueous phases. These capsules
were resistant to high temperatures and low pressures, and no
capsules were formed on replacing CB[8] with CB[7] as only
binary complexes can be formed, and therefore, no crosslinking is achieved. Sustained encapsulation of FITC-labeled
dextran (500 kDa) was also demonstrated, the integrity of the
capsule shell was not compromised, and the cargo was
distributed evenly throughout. Release of the cargo could
even be triggered by reduction of the MV moieties with sodium
dithionite, which breaks the CB[8] complexation, causing
dissolution of the capsule walls. Extra utility of the capsules
arose from the presence of gold nanopaticles in the shell, and
this allowed for the analysis and/or detection of materials
encapsulated within by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) as well as mapping of the microcapsule surface.
In a follow-up communication, Abell and co-workers
demonstrated the fabrication of colloidosomes via analogous
microfluidic methods, Figure 38b.337 Passive diffusive release of
cargo from colloidosomes is highly dependent on pore sizes,
which is determined by the spacing between colloids.
Therefore, the ability to control distances between colloids in
microcapsule walls as well as anchoring the colloids in place is
extremely desirable. Similarly to the production of the
aforementioned gold nanoparticle−polymer composite capsules, polystyrene colloids were functionalized with MV and then
mixed with CB[8] and a copolymer bearing Np moieties,
forming capsules, which were stable upon dehydration.
Encapsulation and passive release of various molecular weight
FITC−dextran was explored, and the authors demonstrated
that 150 kDa FITC−Dextran could be encapsulated for a
prolonged time period as a result of the small gap distance
between colloids. Release could also be triggered by addition of
a competitive guest (adamantyl amine, ADA) by disassembly of
the cross-links and therefore the capsule. The authors
hypothesize that the release rates could be altered by
controlling the intercolloid distance, and this could be achieved
by changing polymer concentrations, cross-link density, or
parameters of the microfluidic device.
The latest example of microcapsule formation facilitated by
the efficient recognition of molecular moieties by CB[8] under
microfluidic conditions was shown by Scherman and coworkers in 2014.338 Assembly of multiple polymer layers and
cross-linking with CB[8] was achieved at a water/chloroform
interface, allowing for microcapsule formation. In this system
there is no requirement for nanoparticles to undergo direct
assembly at the interface as guest-bearing copolymers were
applied to both the aqueous (MV−-polymer) and the oil (Np−
polymer) phases to template capsule formation along the oil/
water interface, and layered assembly was demonstrated by
confocal microscopy of rhodamine- and fluorescein-labeled
components, Figure 38c.
Adding extra functionality to the microcapsules, the hydrophobic polymer could be replaced with a branched dendritic
polymer bearing azobenzene moieties. Incorporation of the
branched dendritic polymer system allowed small molecules to
be encapsulated within the microcapsules and the skin
formation facilitated through 1:1:1 complexation of CB[8],
MV, and azobenzene. Disassembly could be triggered by UV
irradiation, switching the azobenzene configuration from E to
Z, thereby breaking the heteroternary complexes, facilitating
cargo release. These systems have demonstrated robust
assembly techniques and excellent tuning capabilities and
therefore have many potential applications in future delivery
devices.


10.6. CB[n] Cross-Linked Polymer Networks Outlook
CB[n], specifically CB[8], have shown excellent utility in the
development and formation of novel materials. Robust and
efficient recognition motifs allow for rapid assembly of
macroscopic polymer networks of which the dynamics of
such ternary complexes have been shown to have an impact on
material properties. In the example of supramolecular hydrogels, the mere fact that polymer concentration can be retained
and yet a series of different material properties can be accessed
by simply modulating CB[8] concentration, and therefore,
cross-link density allows for a wide applicability of these
hydrogels to future technologies, e.g., 3D cell culture. This is of
particular importance in biomedical applications whereby fasthealing materials are required as injectables; CB[8] cross-linked
hydrogels would be highly impactful on modern medicines.
Manipulation of polymeric materials by microfluidic devices has
led to novel microcapsule structures with excellent control over
assembly processes and potentially excellent utility in future
molecular manipulation and delivery systems.
However, the science of covalently attaching CB[8] to
polymers has yet to be reported but is envisaged to lead to the
development of extremely responsive multicomponent materials with fantastic tuning properties. Therefore, in the future we
hope and expect to see many efforts in reproducible and
scalable methods to monofunctionalize CB[8] with reactive
groups and covalently attach such a molecule to polymer
architectures.



11. CATALYSIS WITHIN CUCURBIT[n]URIL CAVITIES
The ability of CB[n]s to encapsulate various guest molecules
has led to them being used to catalyze and template various
chemical reactions. The first report detailed the catalysis of [3 +
2] cycloadditions339 in the presence of CB[6], which paved the
way for the development of click-chemistry reactions. Since
then, CB[n]s have been used to catalyze solvolysis reactions,340
oxidation reactions,341 and metal-ion-assisted reactions.342
Furthermore, CB[n]s have been utilized in photocatalysis and
templating photochemical reactions343 and, in contrast, have
been employed in reaction inhibition through the protection of
reactive functional species by encapsulation.344 The following
section will focus on key research outcomes in the area of
catalysis and reaction modulation through interactions with
CB[n] macrocycles.
11.1. [3 + 2]-Cycloadditions Catalyzed by CB[6]
The first instance of CB catalysis was reported by Mock and coworkers in the late 1980s, whereby a [3 + 2] cycloaddition of an
alkyene (E1) and an azide (E2) was shown to occur within the
cavity of CB[6] molecules.339 In an aqueous formic acid
solution at 40°C, the cycloaddition occurs slowly with the
formation of substituted triazoles; however, the addition of
catalytic amounts of CB[6] led to a 6 × 105 increase in reaction
rate with triazole (E3) being the only isomer formed as a result
of the orientation of E1 and E2 within the 1:1:1 complex
formed with CB[6]339 (see Figure 39). The catalytic rate increase of the reaction was attributed to an overcoming of
entropic constraints through optimal orientation, in addition to
strain-induced compression of the reactants within the CB[6]
cavity. This pioneering work inspired the development of
azide−alkyene cycloadditions toward “click chemistry” reactions, with rotaxanes, polyrotaxanes, and pseudorotaxanes being
successfully synthesized from CB[6] catalyzed [3 + 2]
cycloadditions.345−349
11.2. CB[n]-Catalyzed Solvolysis Reactions
In 2009, Nau and co-workers reported the catalysis of amides,
carbamates, and oximes by CB[6] and CB[7] through an acid
hydrolysis reaction.340 In the presence of CB[6] or CB[7], the
rate of hydrolysis of an amide with a cadaverine moiety (E4)
rose by a factor of 5 (kcat/kuncat) at pD 0.9, while at pD 1.4 the
reaction rate increased by a factor of 11.6. For carbamate (E5),
the reaction rate increased by a factor of approximately 30 in
the presence of CB[6]. For oxime (E6) in the presence of
CB[7], the reaction rate increased by factors of between 50 and
285 dependent on the pD value, which was varied between 4
and 5.8. The catalytic effect of CBs was proposed to be through
the coloumbic stabilization of the protonated nitrogen
intermediate that occurs during the hydrolysis, in addition to
increasing their apparent pKa values.
Garcia-Rio and co-workers investigated the hydrolysis of
substituted benzoyl chlorides (E7) in the presence of either
CB[7] or methylated-β-cyclodextrin, with each macrocycle
displaying contrasting effects on the reaction.350 For the case of
benzoyl chlorides substituted with electron-donating groups,
CB[7] showed a catalytic effect toward the formation of
benzoic acid (E8), whereas methylated-β-cyclodextrin inhibited
the reaction. Conversely, electron-withdrawing substituted
benzoyl chlorides were inhibited by CB[7] and catalyzed by
methylated-β-cyclodextrin. The opposing effects are explained
through differences in the cavities and portals of these two
macrocycles. For electron-donating substituted benzoyl chlorides, CB[7] catalyzes the reaction through stabilization of the
acylium cation intermediate by its carbonyl-lined portals,
lowering the energy barrier for the reaction. For the electronwithdrawing substituted benzoyl chlorides, methylated-β-cyclodextrin shows a catalytic effect as a result of the hydroxyl groups
of the portals participating in the reaction. This work
demonstrated the role that macrocycle portals can play
influencing reaction rates.
11.3. CB[n]-Catalyzed Oxidation Reactions
In 2009, Zhu and co-workers demonstrated the ability of CB[8]
to catalyze the oxidation of veratryl alchohol to veratraldehyde
by o-iodoxybenzoic acid341 and then extended the approach to
the oxidation of aryl, allyl, and alkyl alcohol compounds.351 The
catalysis was found to be highly dependent on temperature and
moderately dependent on pH, with neutrality favored over
more extreme pH levels. Although the role of CB[8] in the
catalysis was not clear, an increase in the oxidative conversion
of 16.3% was observed at 95 °C in the presence of CB[8].
Reddy and co-workers investigated the catalysis of a series of
reactions involving halogen inclusion complexes with CB[6].81
Fine CB[6] powders were exposed to either I2 or Br2 vapor to
form I2−CB[6]·4H2O and Br2−CB[6]·10H2O, respectively.
Reactions were then performed in the presence of the halogen
complex or its complex with CB[6], with resulting yields being ompared. The greatest increase in yield was seen for that of
the iodine-catalyzed Prins cyclization, where the yield was 7%
higher than that reported in the literature. The remaining
reactions tested all showed yields comparable to what had been
demonstrated in the literature for the uncomplexed halogens.
Nevertheless, this represents a novel use of CB[6] complexes in
halogen-catalyzed reactions.



11.4. Photocatalysis
The efficiency of photochemical reactions can suffer when
performed in solvated environments and where specific
molecular orientations and alignments of reactants are required.
In order to proceed effectively, such barriers need to be
overcome. Molecules that have been excited with photons can
relax either radiatively or nonradiatively (via solvent collisions
etc.), which can drastically reduce reaction efficiency. In
addition, the lack of control over molecule orientation can
lead to many products arising from a single photochemical
reaction or indeed a reaction may not proceed at all if a
particular molecular orientation of the reactants is not met. The
use of CB[n] macrocycles in photochemical reactions may help
to overcome these obstacles. CB[n]s create a reaction
environment that can be solvent free, preventing nonradiative
relaxation. Also, CB[n]s allow for precise orientation of guest
molecules, allowing for specific stereoselectivity of the reaction
product. Lastly, CB[n]s are transparent in the near UV and
visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, promoting
photochemical processes within the CB[n] internal cavity.
Kim and co-workers demonstrated the first use of CB in the
catalysis of a photochemical reaction involving (E)-diaminostilbene (E9).343 The 2:1 complexes of stilbene:CB[8] were shown to form in an aqueous environment as confirmed by 1H
NMR. The ternary complex then underwent a cycloaddition
after UV irradiation (300 nm, 0.5 h) to form a [2 + 2] syn
adduct (E10) within the CB[8] cavity with high selectivity over
the anti adduct (E11). The same experiment performed in the
absence of CB[8] yielded the (Z)-isomer (E12) as the major
product, a product that was not evident at all when CB[8] was
present. It was also demonstrated that the addition of base
(NaOH) to the postphotoreaction complex saw the ejection of
the cyclyzed compound from the CB[8] cavity, regenerating
the cucurbituril catalyst as a result. This work highlighted the
use of CB[8] as a template nanoreactor that can influence
regio- and stereoselectivity in photochemical reactions.
Continuing on from the work of Kim and co-workers,
Ramamurthy and co-workers explored the use of CB[8] in
controlling the photoreactivity of a range of olefin molecules
(some of which include E13, E14, and E15).352,353 The olefins
were irradiated with UV light for 1 h both in the presence and
in the absence of CB[6] and CB[8]. In the presence of CB[7],
compounds E13, E14, and E15 formed their own structural
variations on the (Z)-isomer (E18) and the bridged (Z)-isomer
(E19) with compound E5 also yielding the hydrolysis
compound (E20). With CB[8] present, photodimerization
was favored, with the product distribution favoring the syn
adduct (E16), with minor amounts of the anti adduct (E17)
and the bridged and nonbridged (Z)-isomers also present. This
reaction scheme was then extended to the formation of
symmetric and asymmetric cyclized dimers by localizing
asymmetric olefins within the CB[8] cavity.353
In an effort to expand the versatility of CB[8] in enhanced
photoreactions, Pemberton and co-workers reported the
photodimerization of neutral and cationic coumarin species.20,354 Irradiation of an aqueous solution of a coumarin
and CB[8] in a 2:1 complex led to the formation of the headto-tail adduct as the major product, a result that was
independent of the functional group substitution of the
coumarin derivatives used. The type of head-to-tail adduct
(whether syn or anti) could be controlled by varying the
substituents on the coumarin moiety, with polar substituents
favoring the anti adduct and nonpolar substituents favoring the
syn adduct.
Kim and Inoue and co-workers moved away from [2 + 2]
cycloadditions to concentrate on [4 + 4] cycloadditions in the
presence of both CB[8] and γ-cyclodextrin (CD).136 Both
anthracene and anthracene tethered to α-CD via an ester
linkage (E21) were investigated as photoactive compounds to demonstrate that the stereoselectivity of the [4 + 4]
cycloaddition can be manipulated via conditions outside the
host cavity. Photoexcitation in the absence of CB[8] or γ-CD
led to a mixture of syn-head-to-head (HH, (E22)), anti-HH
(E23), syn-head-to-tail (HT, (E24)), and anti-HT (E25)
isomers forming in roughly the same ratios (with the HT
isomers being favored) for both anthracene and anthracene-α-
CD. The presence of CB[8] or γ-CD during photodimerization
of anthracene led to a minor shift toward the formation of HT
isomers. Photodimerization of anthracene-α-CD in the
presence of γ-CD showed a larger shift toward the HT
isomers, with a ratio as high as 98:2 HT:HH at −20°C and 210
MPa. The introduction of CB[8] into the anthracene-α-CD
system gave rise to a HT:HH ratio of 2:98; an extreme
inversion compared to that of the γ-CD system, showing that
the α-CD attached to the anthracene, which is too large to be
incorporated into the cavities of either γ-CD or CB[8], can
drastically effect the stereochemistry of the products formed by
photocycloaddition. More recently, the photodimerization of
anthracene in CB[8] has been utilized by Biedermann and coworkers in the ligation and cross-linking of polymer networks.162
While CB[8] has also been applied to the stereocontrol of
photochemical reactions involving styryl dyes,138 cinnamic
acids,355 2-naphthalenecarbonitrile, and naphthoate compounds
toward the formation of cubane-like photodimers137,356 as well
as the photothydrolysis of benzoimidazole,357 CB[7] has been
shown to accommodate smaller yet similarly designed guests
for photodimerization. Macartney and co-workers investigated
the [4 + 4] photodimerization of 2-aminopyridine (E26) when
encapsulated in CB[7] in a 1:2 host−guest complex.131 In the
absence of CB[7], a mixture of the syn-trans (E27) and antitrans (E28) photodimers formed in a 1:4 ratio. In the presence
of 50 mol % CB[7], the anti-trans dimer was formed
exclusively. It was also found that CB[7] stabilized the dimer
at room temperature, preventing it from reverting back to the
monomeric 2-aminopyridine.


11.5. Metal Cation-Assisted CB[n] Catalysis
Given their negatively charged carbonyl fringed portals,
cucurbiturils are highly efficient at binding to metal cations, a
property that makes them useful at promoting catalysis
reactions that utilize ionic metal species. Despite cation binding
to CB[n]s being a well-established area of research,36 the idea
of using such complexes for catalysis is relatively new and hence
fairly unexplored. Demets and co-workers investigated the
catalytic properties of an oxovanadium(IV)−CB[6] complex
toward the oxidation of various organic compounds.358 It was
demonstrated that pentane (E29), a linear alkane, could be
oxidized to compounds E30, E31, and E32; however, larger
organic molecules such as styrene (E33) and cyclohexane
(E34) could not. This was explained through the nature of the
VO2+ binding, whereby the vanadium atom bound to the
carbonyl portal of the CB[6], with the oxygen atom pointing
away from the CB[6] cavity, in a distorted square-pyramidal
configuration. This meant that only small molecules that can
enter the CB[6] cavity could be oxidized as the oxygen atom in
the VO2+ species blocked direct access to the vanadium atom
from the other side of the complex. In this way, Demets and coworkers demonstrated a size-selective heterogeneous catalyst
based on CB[6] through metal-ion interactions.
Masson and Lu reported a multistep catalytic cycle for the
desilylation of trimethylsilylalkynl-containing compounds via a
heteroternary complex formed with Ag+ ions and CB[7].342
The desilylation of E35 in the presence of CB[7] and Ag+,
which led to the formation of an alkyl−silver organometallic
complex, was monitored through the 1H NMR response of the
trimethylsilanol byproduct E37 complexed with the CB[7]
cavity. The mechanism proposed for the reaction begins with
E35 forming a complex with CB[7] whereby the trimethylsilane group binds to the CB[7] cavity. A silver cation then forms
a π complex with the triple bond of E35 and the carbonyl portal
of the CB[7]. Molecule E35 then undergoes a nucleophilic
substitution with water, cleaving the trimethylsilyl group,
yielding the trimethylsilanol byproduct (E37) and a alkynyl−
silver complex, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to form the
desilyated alkyne (E36) and the regenerated silver cation.
Nau and co-workers extended the concept of metal−CB[n]
catalysis by utilizing such complexes to effect product formation
from photoreactions involving azoalkanes in a two-phase
system.359 First, the formation of complexes between CB[7]
and metal ions, including Fe3+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ag+, and Ti+,
was confirmed by noting hypsochromic shifts and fluorescence
intensity changes in optical titrations. The complexes were then
tested for their activity toward the photoreactivity of 2,3-
diazabicylo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (E38) and diazabicylo[2.2.1]hept-
2-ene (E41) in a two solvent system, consisting of water and
pentane. Analysis of the organic reaction mixture from a
reaction of E38 by gas chromatography showed a product ratio
of 65:35 for E39/E40 in both the presence and the absence of
CB[7] and a ratio of 70:30 with just metal ions present. This
ratio shifted to 87:13 in the presence of CB[7] and metal ions
(Ti+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Ag+). The preferential
formation of the diene (E40) was theorized to have arisen from
a triplet excited state caused by heavy-atom-doped intersystem
crossing. The photoreaction of E41 resulted in a 100%
preferential conversion to housane (E43), over the secondary
product cyclopentene (E42), in the presence and absence of
CB[7], metal ions, and most metal−CB[7] complexes. A
distinct change in reactivity occurred in the presence of the
CB[7]−Ag+ complex, where a product ratio of 59:41 for E43/
E42 was observed. It was postulated that a photoinduced
electron transfer was likely due to the new mechanism that led
to the formation of cyclopentene, a mechanism that must be
supported by the CB[7]−Ag+ complex, as no cyclopentene
formed in the presence of Ag+ alone, even at concentrations as
high as 1 M. This work demonstrated the potential of CB[n]−
cation complexes in promoting otherwise unobtainable reaction
products via photochemistry.


11.6. Reaction Inhibition by Cucurbit[n]urils
Cucurbiturils show a strong capacity to encapsulate guests
within their hydrophobic cavities. While we have seen that this
can lead to the catalysis of reactions through efficient
orientation of guests and carbonyl portal interactions, in
addition to effecting reaction products through templating, the
encapsulation of guests can also lead to the inhibition of
reactions. In this way, CB[n]s can act in much the same manner
as a protecting group in organic synthesis, shielding specific
molecules and functional moieties from chemical attack.
The redox chemistry of thiol groups and disulfide bridges has
been manipulated through CB[6] binding.344 Kaifer and coworkers first highlighted that compounds such as cysteamine
(E44) and cystamine (E45) and derivatives based on these
compounds can be encapsulated within CB[6] in an orientation
such that the sulfur-containing groups remain inside the hydrophobic cavity. They then investigated the oxidation and
reduction of these compounds in the presence and absence of
CB[6]. When reacted with an excess of dithiothreitol (DTT),
cystamine was shown to be reduced to the thiolated form,
cysteamine, with the reaction coming to completion after
approximately 1 h. In the presence of CB[6], no formation of
cysteamine was observed after 50 h of reaction time. Similar
results were obtained for the oxidation of cysteamine, with no
formation of cystamine in the presence of CB[6], while in its
absence, FeCl3 was able to oxidize cystamine to cysteamine to
completion after approximately 6−7 h. This reduction in
reactivity was also seen when different oxidants were used,
including dissolved oxygen and chloropicrin. This work
highlighted the impressive ability of CBs to not only protect
a species from chemical attack but also kinetically hinder both
forward and reverse reactions as a result of host−guest complex
formation.
Masson and co-workers demonstrated the use of CB[7] in
modulating the chemiluminescence of Lucigenin (E46).360
Lucigenin undergoes chemiluminescent degradation upon the
addition of sodium peroxide, which leads to the formation of
dioxetane (E47). Dioxetane then undergoes homolytic cleavage
to produce singlet excited acridone (E48), which relaxes to the
ground state (E49) via photon emission. CB[7] was shown to
modulate this reaction by binding to various R group
substituents of Lucigenin that are present on either side of
the biacridine unit. The binding decreased dioxetane formation
and dimmed the chemiluminescent reaction. Chemiluminescence could be restored through the addition of a competitive
CB[7] guest. In this way, CB[7] can be utilized in regulating
the rate of chemiluminescent reactions.
Cong and co-workers reported the use of CB[6] and CB[7]
in the prevention of acylation of the antituberculosis drug,
isoniazid.362 For all acylating agents tested, stoichiometric additions of either CB[6] or CB[7] rendered isoniazid
completely unreactive to acylation, with the initial rate of
acylation decreasing between 10 and 100 fold in the presence of
0.8:1 CB to isoniazid. The mechanism for the protection was
concluded to arise because of an increase in the pKa value of the
isoniazid, as a result of the amino protons binding to the
carbonyl portals of CB. This work demonstrates the potential
for CB[n]s to be used as drug carriers for isoniazid, increasing
its bioavailability in the presence of acetylators.
CB[7] has also been shown to stabilize biologically active
molecules from various chemical degradation pathways. Biczok
and co-workers utilized inclusion complexes with CB[7] and
sanguinarine, a natural biologically active benzophenanthridine
alkaloid, to stave off photo-oxidation and nucleophilic attack.361
The iminium form (E50) of sanguinarine formed both 1:1 and
2:1 host−guest complexes with CB[7], with binding constants
of 106 and 103 M−1, respectively. The iminium form of
sanguinarine is susceptible to nucleophilic attack by hydroxide
ions at the 6 position, leading to the uncharged alkanolamine
form (E51), a reaction that was prevented when complexed
with CB[7]. The hydroxylated form of sanguinarine can also
form a complex with CB[7], with a binding constant of 2.45 ×
102 M−1. The alkanolamine form can undergo an irreversible
photo-oxidation reaction to produce 6-oxysanguinarine. This
reaction was hindered by the presence of CB[7], likely through
preventing oxygen from reaching the sanguinarine while
encapsulated within the CB cavity.
In addition to modulating the rate of chemical reactions,
CB[7] has been exploited to regulate the activity of enzymes.
Ghosh and co-workers designed bifunctional inhibitor molecules with affinities for both CB[7] and either bovine carbonic
anhydrase (BCA) or acetylcholinesterase (AChE).363 The
addition of inhibitor molecules in stoichiometric ratios to
BCA saw a decrease in its catalytic activity as a result of the
blocking of its active site. The addition of CB[7] to the enzyme·
inhibitor complex saw the formation of enzyme·inhibitor·CB[7]
complexes that underwent prompt dissociation, releasing
inhibitor·CB[7] and reforming the active enzyme. The
inhibition could then be cycled by adding a competitive guest
for CB[7], releasing the inhibitor molecule. While BCA was
shown to follow the inhibition cycle mentioned, AChE did not
give the formation of stable complexes with both inhibition
molecules and CB[7] simultaneously. This meant that CB[7]
was unable to actively dissociate the inhibitor molecule from
AChE. By using tailored inhibitor molecules with affinities for
both enzymes and CB[7] macrocycles, cucurbiturils could play
an important role in allowing for dynamic manipulation over
the activity of enzymes.


12. RECOGNITION BY CB[n] IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS
Molecular recognition and detection of biomolecules in
aqueous solution, particularly peptides and proteins, is an
important target within biomedical sectors, especially those
focused on sensing and separation. Research from the
Brunsveld, Buschmann, Kim, Li, Nau, Scherman, and Urbach
groups has brought the art of amino acid complexation and
recognition by CB[n] receptors forward to protein−protein
conjugation and solution-phase structure elucidation. This area
has seen a large expansion in the number of publications on the
binding of amino acids, peptides, and proteins in the past 10
years, and a wealth of knowledge of binding constants and
conformations has been developed through utilization of a
variety of spectroscopic and modeling techniques.
12.1. Amino Acid and Short Peptide Recognition by CB[n]
An early example of short polypeptide recognition by CB[n]
was reported by Buschmann and co-workers in 2005.364 This
research determined binding constants for a small library of dior tripeptides through ion−dipole interactions between the
protonated N-terminus of the peptides and the portals of
CB[6]. The authors found that there was no significant
dependence on peptide size to CB[6] binding, inferring that
only an exclusion complex is formed (unlike alkylamino
cations), likely resulting from the polarity of the peptide
bonds. Nevertheless, the portal interaction is entropically
favorable as two molecules of water are released from CB[6]
upon peptide complexation.
Concurrently, Urbach and co-workers essentially pioneered
the art of amino acid sensing when they reported the ability of
CB[8]·MV to recognize and complex with tripeptides of
glycine and a single tryptophan residue (WGG, GWG, GGW)
forming charge-transfer complexes. This was monitored by UV
absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopies as well as ITC.130 The authors found WGG had the
overall highest Ka of the three peptides (1.3 × 105 M−1, 6-fold
higher than GWG and 40-fold higher than GGW) to CB[8]·
MV and that electrostatic interactions of the C-terminus played a large part in the binding affinity on account of repulsion
between the carbonyl portals of CB[8] and the carboxylate of
the peptides. Binding of the tryptophan residue to the CB[8]
cavity was accompanied by charge-transfer complexation with
MV and consequent fluorescence quenching of the indole
group as well as broadening of signals in 1H NMR. This work
was later extended into recognition of multivalent peptides by
self-assembled receptors.365 Here peptide scaffolds were
functionalized with multiple MV units (1−3) that each recruit
one CB[8] host. This self-assembled receptor was then able to
bind in a 1:1 fashion with identical peptides bearing
complementary tryptophan residues in place of the MV of
the receptors, Figure 44a.
Urbach and co-workers also observed 2:1 binding of aromatic
amino acids to CB[8].165 Consistent with the previous study,
tripeptides consisting of 2 glycine residues and a single
tryptophan or phenylalanine were investigated, and it was
again found that the distance of the aromatic residue from the
C-terminus had a large effect on binding affinity. Sequential
binding modeling of ITC data demonstrated, in the case of
WGG, the second binding constant is a magnitude lower than
the first; however, this could not be determined for FGG due to
cooperativity in binding. WGG was found to bind to CB[8] in a
2:1 fashion in a noncooperative manner unlike FGG, whereby
ITC data suggests positive cooperativity. The authors also
managed to isolate a crystal structure of FGG bound in a 2:1
fashion to CB[8], with the aromatic residues encapsulated in a
stacking geometry within the cavity, Figure 44b. Hydrogenbonding interactions between the peptide N−H’s and the
CB[8] carbonyl portals were also apparent. Other aromatic
amino acid residues were investigated (tyrosine, histidine);
however, binding to CB[8] was not observed for these
derivatives.



The study of 2:1 binding of middle-chain phenylalanine
residues in pentapeptides to CB[8] has also been investigated
by Scherman and co-workers.164 This is the first example of
strong 2:1 binding in a longer peptide chain where the Phe
residue is not located at the N-terminus. The pentapeptides
selected were based on the aggregation-promoting region of
wild-type human amyloid β (Aβ), a peptide that has been
linked to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The Aβ
fragments explored were AEFRH, LVFIA, and VIFAE, of which
the latter two were overlapping regions of the Aβ sequence but
with one of the F residues exchanged for I (isoleucine). In wildtype Aβ this region actually contains two neighboring Phe
units, and the authors chose to replace one of these residues in
each sequence with isoleucine to ease synthesis and analysis of
results when combined with CB[8]. The 2:1 binding modes
were confirmed by fluorescence and NMR spectroscopies and
ITC analyses, and despite differing charges, hydrophobicity,
and steric hindrance, all sequences formed strong homoternary
complexes on the order of 109−1013 M−2, Figure 44c. This
study demonstrates CB[8] is able to access potentially hindered
Phe residues in non-N-terminal sites of peptides and may also
hold advantages to the future of understanding Aβ fibrillation
mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease.
The 1:1 binding of phenylalanine derivatives to CB[7] has
also been investigated by Urbach and co-workers. Remarkably,
one derivative, 4-aminomethyl−phenylalanine, was reported to
have a Kd of 0.95 nM (500 times stronger affinity than
phenylalanine).366 However, biomolecule detection often has to
be performed at much lower concentrations. Other chemical
modifications of phenylalanine were investigated such as tertbutyl and hydroxyl groups at the 4-phenyl position, but none of
these modifications provided such a stark increase in binding
affinity as the amino-methyl group. A later report by Urbach
and co-workers detailed nanomolar detection of peptides
harnessing CB[8] complexes of tetramethylbenzobisimidazolium (MBBI).97MBBI·CB[8] was shown to have an intriguing
response to tripeptides Tyr-Leu-Ala and Tyr-Ala-Leu within
nanomicromolar detection limits. In the former case, a
fluorescence enhancement was observed upon combination,
elucidating displacement of MBBI from CB[8], and this result
was confirmed by NMR studies. In the latter example,
fluorescence was seemingly quenched by the formation of a
1:1:1 charge-transfer inclusion complex of CB[8], Tyr-Ala-Leu,
and MBBI. Therefore, MBBI·CB[8] is able to act as both a
nanomolar “fluorescence-off” receptor for Tyr-Ala-Leu and a
“fluorescence on” receptor of Tyr-Leu-Ala, simultaneously. This
is the first example of highly specific recognition of N-terminal
Tyr tripeptides by CB[8], whereby in certain cases the peptide
chain can fold and be mostly included within the CB[8] cavity
(as modeled) at the expense of dissociation of MBBI. The
authors suggest that given the minimal structure of this TyrLeu-Ala peptide, it could easily be engineered into recombinant
proteins as an affinity tag.
Urbach and co-workers also demonstrated inhibition of a
nonspecific exopeptidase porcine amino peptidase N (APN)
with CB[7] via binding of phenylalanine units present within
the peptide.367 N-Exopeptidases degrade peptides by sequential
cleavage of amino acids from the N-terminus. With CB[7]
bound to a Phe residue within a peptide sequence (Thr-GlyAla-Phe-Met), cleavage of the amide bond was completely
inhibited upon reaching the CB7·Phe complex, and therefore,
Phe-Met was stable to APN degradation. The authors elude to
the applicability of this system in the protection of longer
peptides from APNs, which could prolong peptide lifetimes in
vitro and in vivo.
Collaboration between the Urbach and the Nau groups led
to the development of a tandem assay whereby discrimination
of CB[7] affinity for fluorescent dyes and peptides allowed for
determination of protease substrate selectivity and inhibitor
activities.368 In this study, mixtures of acridine orange
(fluorescent dye), CB[7], peptides (with Phe residues), and
proteases were formulated. Initially acridine orange is
encapsulated by CB[7] on account of a stronger binding
constant than the midchain Phe residue of the peptide and
fluoresces. Upon cleavage of the peptide by proteases, the Phe
unit was revealed in the new N-terminus position, the acridine
orange was displaced from the CB[7] by the peptide, and
fluorescence of the dye was quenched. This system was utilized
to quantify the activity of several proteases but also was able to
determine the activity of protease inhibitors. This method
proved to be a robust way to determine both enzyme and
inhibitor activity at nanomolar levels in a label-free manner.
However, it is limited to peptides that yield products with Nterminal aromatic amino acids upon enzymatic degradation.
This area has seen excellent progression over the past decade
from recognition of amino acids by CB[8]·MV toward the
development of sensitive detection assays and dimerization of
larger peptides by CB[8].


12.2. Noncovalent Protein Conjugation
In more recent literature, the groups of Scherman, Brunsveld,
and various others have developed methods to conjugate
macromolecules to larger proteins via CB[8] recognition. An early example of noncovalent conjugation was of PEG to BSA
through CB[8] ternary complex formation, as reported by
Scherman and co-workers in 2011, Figure 45a.143 PEGylated
proteins have distinct physicochemical properties (resistance to
biodegradation, etc.), and therefore, bioconjugation of polymers in a site-specific and dynamic manner is applicable to
many biological sectors, especially therapeutic protein delivery.
In this example, a BSA fraction was functionalized with a single
naphthoxy moiety at its only free thiol cystine residue.
Combining this in solution with PEG-MV and CB[8] led to
ternary complex formation, and a PEG−BSA bioconjugate was
observed by DOSY NMR, DLS, UV/vis, and fluorescence
spectroscopies and ITC. This work, as described in the authors
conclusions, demonstrated controlled supramolecular formation of PEG−protein bioconjugates, which is a proof of concept
for further translation or potentially protein−protein supramolecular conjugation.
Protein−protein heterodimerization of MV- and Np-bearing
proteins with CB[8] was reported by Brunsveld and co-workers
several months later.144 This study demonstrated the selective
dimerization of two different proteins, one bearing MV to a
second protein bearing Np, following on from previous work by
Brunsveld, which was limited to dimerization of identical
proteins through 2:1 complexation of FGG−protein sequences
with CB[8], Figure 45b.282 In both cases protein FRET pairs
could be dimerized, and therefore, the assembly process was
studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. A follow-up SAXS study
eluded to the compact nature of packing of such dimers when
complexed in solution.369Collaboration between the Brunsveld
and the Dankers groups saw the production of (FGGG)2penta-
(ethylene glycol), which could form ring structures on the
binding of its 2 FGGG units to CB[8] and modulate protein
dimerization with more control than simple competitive FGG
molecules, Figure 45c.281 CB[8]-mediated homotetramerization of fluorescent proteins was later reported by Brunsveld and
co-workers.370 This was achieved by combining the 2:1
complexation motif of FGG (encoded at the N-terminus of
many proteins) to CB[8] with intrinsic affinities between
proteins, essentially producing supramolecular dimers of
dimers.
Brunsveld and co-workers later reported a further study on
the dimerization of inactive enzyme monomers with CB[8] to
form an active enzyme supramolecular dimer.371 Here Caspase-
9, which is only active in its dimeric form, was complexed
together via recognition of FGG moieties by CB[8]. Perhaps
most importantly, the activity of the enzyme was not
compromized by the supramolecular elements that induce
dimerization, and a great deal of molecular control over the
system was achieved, i.e., CB[8] concentration controlled the
degree of dimerization and therefore activity of the Caspase
solution.
In summary, significant progress has been made in the
understanding of protein conjugation facilitated by CB[8]
recognition motifs, and this insight is starting to be translated
toward modulation in protein activity showing great promise
for the future applicability of this field.


12.3. Further Application to Biochemistry
Urbach and co-workers reported a 1:1 binding stoichiometry
between CB[7] and insulin at the N-terminal phenylalanine of
the insulin B chain.96 This is a particularly interesting result as
there are three Phe residues in the insulin sequence; however,
replacement experiments of these other residues confirmed that
it is solely the N-terminal Phe that binds to CB[7]. This is
starkly different to other methods of recognizing proteins as no
modifications to the peptide sequence in terms of histidine
tagging have been performed. Recognition has simply been
achieved through mixing the native protein with CB[7], and
large binding constants upward of 106 M−1 were reported. Kim and co-workers showed that CB[7] binding to Phe
residues of insulin and amyloid β prevented aggregation of such
proteins.372 This is very important for both insulin storage and
understanding development of Alzheimer’s disease through
amyloid aggregation. These studies show that by masking the
hydrophobic residues of Aβ or insulin with CB[7] or at least
increasing steric hindrance around these regions via complex
formation significant inhibition of the aggregation process can
be achieved. Through a variety of biological assays and binding
studies the authors demonstrate that CB[7]−Phe complexation
is much faster than protein−protein dimerization, and the Phespecific binding of CB[7] successfully modulates intermolecular
interactions, preventing fibrillation processes, and is therefore a
pathway for new potential treatments for amyloid linked
diseases.
A 2011 report by Kim and co-workers demonstrated the gasphase host guest chemistry of CB[6] and Lys-containing
peptides.373 Through collisional activation, CB[6] was found to
efficiently complex to Lys residues of model peptides in the gas
phase, often resulting in common fragmentation products. This
was used to elucidate protein structure, specifically in the case
of ubiquitin, by employing tandem mass spectrometry
techniques on CB[6]−protein complexes formed in aqueous
conditions to determine solution-phase conformations. A
follow-up study investigated the conformational changes of
ubiquitin proteins upon CB[6] complexation in the gas phase
at a variety of different charge states of which specific Lys
residues complexed with CB[6] were able to be determined.
CB[6] complexes inhibited salt bridge formations and therefore
triggered conformation changes. This could be reversed and the
protein refolded upon CB[6] detachment.374 In the future this
research will hopefully be translated to other protein structures
and improve mass spectrometry techniques for determining
protein structure as well as determining protein sequences that
in turn determine higher order conformations.
Inhibition of DNA restriction enzymes by CB[6] and CB[7]
was reported by Pischel and collaborators.375 In this example
binding of CB[6] and CB[7] to DNA restriction enzymes is
hypothesized to be the cause of inhibition of DNA hydrolysis;
however, the authors were unable to determine exactly which
residues of the restriction enzyme were bound by the CBs. It
was shown that DNA hydrolysis could be reactivated by simple
addition of spermine, which competes for the macrocycle
cavity, likely releasing the restriction enzymes and allowing
continuation of DNA hydrolysis.


12.4. Profiling Toxicity of Cucurbit[n]uril
The year 2010 saw two reports showing CB[n]-type containers
exhibiting good biocompatibility profiles. Isaacs, Briken, and coworkers examined the viability of HepG2 (liver derived) and
RAW264.7 (macrophage) cells after 24 h exposure to CB[5]
and CB[7].100 Both cell lines showed good tolerance to CB[5]
and CB[7] up to 1 mM with cell viabilities exceeding 90%.
Moreover, the internalization of CBs with encapsulated FITC
by macrophages was proven to be very efficient, and treatment
of mycobacteria with CB[7]-bound drug molecules did not see
any significant decrease in efficacy of the therapeutic
compound. Furthermore, acyclic analogues of CB[n] were
also studied, and the cells also expressed high tolerance for such
compounds beyond usual therapeutic levels.
Day, Nau, and co-workers also explored the in vitro activity
of CB[7] and CB[8], specifically against CHO-K1 cells
(ovarian cell line from hamsters).99 An IC50 value of 0.53 ±
0.02 mM was determined, which roughly corresponds to 620
mg kg−1 of cell material. The authors also tested CB[8] toxicity
and found that the macrocycle expressed no significant toxicity
within its solubility limits. Further to these results, live cell
imaging of cells exposed to nonlethal CB[7] concentrations
demonstrated that there were no detrimental or adverse effect
on the cellular integrity.
Progressing toward in vivo studies on mice, intravenous
injections determined a maximum tolerable dose of CB[7] to
be 250 mg kg−1 with the mice initially losing some superficial
weight but recovering within 5−8 days. For oral administration,
a 600 mg kg−1 one-off dose of 1:1 CB[7]:CB[8] mixture did
not give rise to any significant toxicity.
The Wheate group studied the ex vivo toxicology of CB[6]
and CB[7] under more specific circumstances, analyzing the
neuro-, myo-, and cardiotoxic activity of the compounds.101 To
study neurotoxicity, a mouse sciatic nerve (removed from
between the knee and spinal cord) was exposed to 1 mM
solutions of CB[6] or CB[7] and the conductivity of the nerve
monitored for 2 h; no significant neurotoxicity was observed.
Furthermore, cisplatin·CB[7] did not show a decrease in
neurotoxicity as compared to free cisplatin. Myotoxicity was
also studied by extracting biventer cervicis nerve muscles from
chicks, and their contraction response to chemical or electrical
stimuli was monitored before and after exposure to 0.3 mM
CB[6] and CB[7] solutions. CB[6] caused only a very small
change in the strength of muscle contraction, so it can be
considered relatively safe. However, CB[7] had a much greater
effect on muscle contraction, and the authors hypothesize that
this is due to CB[7] binding to postsynaptic nicotinic receptors,
interfering with the depolarization ability of the muscle
membrane. β-Cyclodextrin exposure also resulted in small
decreases in muscle contraction, was not myotoxic in vivo, and
may possibly also be the case for CB[6] and CB[7].
Cardiotoxicity was examined using a similar method but with
rat heart atria. Both CB[6] and CB[7] showed significant ex
vivo cardiotoxicity, exemplified by changes in contraction
forces. However, the authors of this study conclude that these
experiments represent very high exposure levels to the
macrocycles with direct contact with the tissues and so may
not be accurate predictions of activity in human clinical models.
To better understand specific organ toxicity in vivo, Wang
and collaborators employed zebrafish models to further study
the contribution of CB[7] exposure to neuro-, myo-, and
cardiotoxicity as well as hepatotoxicity, developmental toxicity,
locomotion, and behavioral toxicity.102 Mortality studies
determined an LD50 (lethal dose) to be at 750 μM when
zebrafish were incubated with CB[7] for 2 days. No
morphological abnormalities were observed on developing
zebrafish exposed to even the higher, more toxic, levels of
CB[7]. Some detrimental effects on cardioactivity were
observed on zebrafish exposed to CB[7] concentrations greater
than 500 μM including elevated heart rates, thinning of the
atrium, distorted heart shape, decreased stroke volume, and
decreased cardiac output, which is consistent with the ex vivo
study by Wheate. In terms of locomotive effects, extended
exposure to higher concentrations of CB[7] significantly
shortened swimming distances of zebrafish, which could be a
factor of the observed cardiotoxicity; however, the authors
reasoned that this was more likely a neurotoxic effect,
conflicting with the Wheate ex vivo study. The authors did
not observe any hepatotoxicity on zebrafish embryos,
demonstrating a high degree of tolerability of CB[7] by the liver. This study is promising as detrimental effects were not
observed below usual therapeutic concentrations of most drug
compounds, suggesting a reasonable level of tolerance of CB[7]
in vivo and therefore warranting much further study in larger
animal models.
12.5. Outlook
A considerable amount of work has been carried out in the area
of peptide and protein supramolecular complexation with
CB[n], and understanding of aromatic amino acid residues,
cavity hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding to portals,
and cooperative interactions in the example of CB[8] are
progressing from the work of several groups. Protein
dimerization is particularly exciting in terms of controlling
activity and stability, and many interesting studies into other
forms of bioconjugation harnessing such host−guest recognition are likely on the horizon. Particularly remarkable studies
are those of insulin and amyloid β and how the interactions of
specific Phe residues modulate aggregation pathways. With
these reported methodical studies in hand it is not difficult to
imagine how many more CB[n]−biomolecule interactions will
come to light in the near future with new protocols to control
and regulate protein activity. It is also promising that initial
studies suggesting application of CB-based materials to human
clinical settings will not be hampered by issues of toxicity.



13. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
In just over three decades since the isolation and full
characterization of the first cucurbit[n]uril homologue, this
macrocyclic family has transformed from a laboratory bench
curiosity into a compound of industrial significance. The
widespread number of fields that CB[n] has found applications
in is remarkable. Ranging from applications in (but not limited
to) materials design, development of next-generation sensors,
sophistication of medical techniques through efficient drug
delivery and encapsulation, potential in energy harnessing
through its catalytic properties, and green technology, CB[n]
has been an exceptional contestant in all these fields. CB[n] has
also proven itself as a versatile tool in fundamental research
such as in separation science, as a precise molecular ruler for
plasmonics, and as a catalytic reagent and nanoreactor. In this
review, we intended to focus on themes related to CB[n] that
have not been presented in great detail in the literature prior to
its writing. For example, we discuss the gas binding properties
of CB[n] and the interaction of CB[n] with surfaces and their
interesting applications. We also highlighted the recent progress
in various fields that have utilized the chemical and physical
properties of CB[n] in an innovative manner including
polymeric materials and networks as well as biological systems.
The exploration of the complexation capabilities of CB[n]
with various guest molecules has led to the discovery of a
plethora of species that are of scientific interest. New guests are
constantly being reported providing unique insights into the
understanding of the molecular recognition properties of
CB[n]. The advent of sophisticated characterization techniques
has complemented research efforts in elucidating the
fundamental processes behind CB[n] host−guest chemistry.
In addition, this review on CB[n] notably presents the first
comprehensive tabulation of all the binding data that can be
readily found in the literature through the first half of 2015. The
similarities as well as disparities in the binding constants that
result from different techniques and measurement conditions
are unmistakable. Therefore, the need to standardize measurement and characterization methods is critical, underpinning the
importance of reporting precise conditions in which the
measurements are taken.
Driven by the shortcomings exhibited by several CB[n]
homologues arising from their extremely low water solubility,
various strategies to functionalize CB[n] have been pursued.
Additionally, the functionalized host molecules have opened up
possibilities to tether them to surfaces and polymeric materials.
Although the topic has not been discussed in great detail in this
review, the increasing pace of research activity and growing
interest in controlled functionalization of CB derivatives is
apparent and will likely warrant a dedicated review itself in the
next few years.
