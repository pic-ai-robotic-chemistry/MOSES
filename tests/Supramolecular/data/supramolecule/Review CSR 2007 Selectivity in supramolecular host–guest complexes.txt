The background of possible selectivity–affinity correlations and their limitations is reviewed,
with typical crown ether and cryptand complexes, ionic associations, hydrogen bonded complexes
and complexes driven by van der Waals, stacking or hydrophobic interactions, with some
additional topics including associations based on metal coordination as supplementary material.
This tutorial review is addressed to students and researchers interested in molecular recognition,
and relates to the design of sensors, of discriminators for separation processes, of supramolecular
devices and of drug compounds. A theoretical analysis of selectivity in supramolecular host–guest
complexes, defined as a difference in binding free energies for structurally related guests,
as a function of total binding free energy shows that for certain types of intermolecular
interactions one may observe a correlation between selectivity and affinity. Such correlation
fails however if the selectivity is due to additional interactions at a secondary binding sites,
which is expected in complexes with anisotropic guest molecules. Several clear examples of
theoretically expected selectivity–affinity correlations are found. The influence of reaction
conditions on the experimentally observed selectivity, defined as a difference in complexation
degrees with different guests in the presence of added receptor, is illustrated. The importance
of often neglected solvent effects on selectivity is exemplified with ionophore and hydrogen
bonded complexes.
1 Introduction/aims/scope
High selectivity is a hallmark of biological receptors, and has
always been a most important aim of synthetic supramolecular
chemistry.1 At the same time high affinity, which ensures
high sensitivity for a chosen analyte or reagent, is an equally
significant goal. The importance of possible correlations
between
affinity
and
selectivity
has
only
recently
been
emphasized,2 and will be a major focus of the present review,
as well as the consequences of multivalency in supramolecular
complexes. The underlying principles are relatively well
understood for complexation of metal ions,3 although ques-
tions regarding e.g. the role of enthalpic vs. entropic contribu-
tions remain open. Aspects of selectivity in metal complex
formation related to strain and stress induced by complexation
as well as to fit and misfit between interacting components
have been already reviewed.4 In this review we will discuss
typical examples of host–guest complexes, arranged according

to their interaction mechanism. Space limitations do not allow
us to discuss many other approaches to highly selective and
strong associations, in particular on the basis of metal
coordination complexes5 (for more examples and illustrations
see ESI{).
The mechanistic basis for a most selective molecular
recognition poses many problems, which will be addressed in
the present review. In traditional supramolecular chemistry
selectivity is characterized by the hole-size fitting concept;1
which, however, requires significant modifications. As has
been shown in particular with coordination complexes an
optimal affinity is reached if bonds between transition metal
ions and the donor functions are formed with a minimum of
strain energy.3,4 Another limitation is that due to solvation
and likely entropic factors a higher binding constant is often
observed if the guest molecule enjoys more freedom, and
occupies only part of the space inside a host cavity.6 The
design
of
suitable
host
geometries
can
be
significantly
supported
by
calculational
approaches.7
The
until
now
scarcely investigated dependence of selectivity on the reaction
medium will be another focus of this review as well as the often
overlooked fact, that in complexes where protonation plays a
significant
role,
the
experimentally
observed
selectivity
depends on the pH used in the competitive recognition
experiments. A few examples will serve to illustrate co-
operativity effects in allosteric and co-complexation systems.
The strong dependence of selectivity on the nature of the
underlying non-covalent forces will be highlighted with host–
guest complexes from the literature. It is hoped, that the
overview will help not only the rational design of highly
selective synthetic receptors, but also support the under-
standing of biological systems. Although the selectivity aspect
is always considered in reviews and monographs on supra-
molecular chemistry, it rarely has been a subject of a special
discussion.8 The obvious importance of this aspect for the
design of sensors, of discriminators for separation processes,
of many supramolecular devices and last not least of drug
compounds
justifies
an
attempt
to
highlight
the
basic
principles and possible new approaches in this area.
2 Some theoretical considerations on affinity–
selectivity correlations and their limitation
For reaction of a receptor R with either ligand X or ligand Y,
with equilibrium constants KRX and KRY one can write the
familiar expressions (1) and (2)
KRX = exp(2DGRX/RT)
(1)
KRY = exp(2DGRY/RT)
(2)
The selectivity now can be expressed by eqn (3).
KRX/KRY = exp[(DGRY 2 DGRX)/RT]
(3)
Since with larger absolute values of interaction free energies
one also may expect to observe larger differences between
them, in most general terms one may expect increased
selectivity with increased affinity. However, this depends also
on the way in which a change in receptor or ligand structure or
a change in reaction conditions affects the DG values. For
several types of intermolecular interactions the binding free
energy (or log K) can be expressed as a product of certain
physicochemical properties (P) of receptor R and ligand L,
eqn (4).
DGRL = aPRPL + b
(4)
This is true for ionic association, where PR and PL are
charges of receptor and ligand, for hydrogen bonding, where
PR and PL are e.g. acidity and basicity parameters of H-donor
and H-acceptor groups of receptor and ligand molecules, and
in a more complicated form for Lewis acid–base (metal–
ligand) interactions. Combining eqn (3) and (4) one obtains
following expressions for selectivity.
DGRY 2 DGRX = aPR(PY 2 PX)
(5)
KRX/KRY = exp[aPR(PY 2 PX)/RT]
(6)
Obviously, for a given pair of ligands X and Y the ratio of
binding constants will increase for receptors possessing larger
PR values and larger affinity to both ligands.
Most synthetic and biological receptors are polydentate; the
total binding free energy then is usually the sum of single
interaction energies. This additivity principle has been shown
to be valid for large number of supramolecular complexes
including ion pairing, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals
forces as intermolecular binding contributions, provided of
course that the interacting functions are in a geometrically
matching position.9 An important particular case of this
situation is involvement of a number n of the same type of
interactions provided by a multidentate receptor for binding
of a given ligand. In this case one obtains the following
expression for DGRL:
DGRL = nDDGi
(7)
where DDGi is the pairwise binding free energy increment.
Obviously these increments will be different for ligands
X and Y, so one obtains for the free energy difference and
for the ratio of binding constants expressions (8) and (9)
respectively.
DGRY 2 DGRX = n(DDGiY 2 DDGiX)
(8)
KRX/KRY = exp[n(DDGiY 2 DDGiX)/RT]
(9)
Since n is a property of the receptor R, eqn (8) and (9)
apparently are similar to (5) and (6), and predict an increase in
selectivity by multivalency on the basis of a total binding free
energy increase.
Almost perfect correlations between selectivity and affinity
in terms of eqn (8) and (9) can be seen for example in simple
coordination complexes with linear polyamine ligands, Fig. 1.
An important limitation of a selectivity–affinity correlation
stems from the often valid situation, that a host provides for
a primary interaction site which may secure a high affinity
to the guest through the binding to a complementary guest

interaction site A9, and a second, often geometrically distant
site S, which secures the selectivity. Scheme 1 illustrates that if
two guest molecules guest X and guest Y feel with primary host
site A or B different interaction energies DGAA9 and DGBA9, but
the same DGSY at the discrimination site S, that the selectivity
ratio KX/KY can be the same, even if the total binding
constants may differ enormously. Many host systems used for
the discrimination of anisotropic guest molecules do make use
of at least two different interaction sites, for which reason we
can expect mostly for simple isotropic systems such as metal
cations or halide anions a linear correlation between selectivity
and affinity of complexation.
3 Crown ether and cryptand complexes: hole size
fitting and other effects
The theoretically expected simultaneous increase of selectivity
and affinity is rarely seen in quantitative terms with receptors
of variable structures, but can be often observed in limited
series of structurally similar hosts, as will be illustrated below.
We start these analyses with the historically oldest supra-
molecular complexes between alkali cations and crown ethers
or cryptands.
Fig. 2 (solid triangles) shows the linear correlation between
the formation free energies of complexes with K+ against those
with Na+ for 32 ionophores derivatives of 18-C-6 in MeOH
taken from ref. 10 The slope 0.67 ¡ 0.05 (R = 0.918) of
the correlation reflects just the intrinsic affinity differences
between these cations with any receptor. In gas phase
associations11 between parent cation acceptor molecules both
the DG values for Na+ and K+ associations and the differences
DDG between them are much larger due to the absence of
competing solvents. Thus, dimethyl ether with K+ shows
2DG = 50 kJ mol21, with Na+ 74 kJ mol21 (DDG =
24 kJ mol21); for dimethyl ethylene glycol the values are for
K+ 90, for Na+ 133 kJ mol21 (DDG = 44 kJ mol21; DG data are
mostly calculated from published11 DH and DS values). This
emphasizes the theoretically expected effect of large total
binding free energy on the selectivity. In the condensed phase
the difference is by orders of magnitude smaller, and is
reversed (see Section 9: Solvent effects).
The DG variations in crown ether and cryptand complexes
are due to differences in the electron donor capacity CD of the
heteroatoms, which can be characterized by measurements of
related hydrogen bond associations. It has been shown that

by nine orders of magnitude.

e.g. the stability of K+ complexes with all such ionophores
correlate with the sum gCD with very little scatter.9a From this
point of view one may expect the K+/Na+ selectivity to
correlate with affinity, e.g. expressed as log KK. Indeed, such
correlation exists (dashed line in Fig. 2, slope 0.33 ¡ 0.05,
R = 0.747); if one chooses series of more closely related
ligands, e.g. only aliphatic derivatives (grey squares) or only
benzo-derivatives (grey circles) the correlations become much
less scattered. On the other hand an attempt to correlate
results for crown ethers of different sizes and in different media
did not show any tendency of increased selectivity for hosts
with higher affinities (see ESI{).
A fairly linear correlation between selectivity and affinity
is
observed
with
structurally
related
calixarene-based
ionophores.12
These
hosts
show
approximately
constant
discrimination factor of 10 between the best fitting cations
K+ and Rb+ (dashed line in Fig. 3), but one observes the
theoretically expected linear correlation for complexation
selectivity of K+ vs. the smaller Na+ and larger Cs+ ions (solid
line in Fig. 3).
4 Ion pairs in aqueous medium
4.1 Selectivity by charge differences
It has been demonstrated that equilibrium constants for a
large number of ionic association reactions in water can be
satisfactorily fitted to the eqn (10) where zR and zL are total
charges of R and L13
log KRL = azRzL + b
(10)
Parameters a and b vary for different types of charged
species, e.g. they are different for inorganic anions and
carboxylates, but within a series of given chemical species
eqn (10) provides a reasonably good correlation. Alternatively
the free energy of association can be estimated by multi-
plication of a constant binding increment of 25.5 kJ mol21 (at
ionic strength 0.1 M) by the number of all pairwise ionic
contacts between R and L.9a The expression for selectivity
which follows from eqn (10) and (5) takes the form of eqn (11).
Dlog KRL = azR(zY 2 zX)
(11)
This provides perhaps the simplest case of selectivity when
ions of different charges can be differentiated by Coulombic
interaction with oppositely charged receptor, where the degree
of differentiation increases with the increase in receptor
charge. Obviously, ions of similar charge (zY = zX) are not
expected to be discriminated in this way.
Fig. 4 shows the experimental results for ion association of
five inorganic anions with differently protonated forms of
spermine, which follow eqn (10) with a = 0.612 and b = 0
(dashed lines). As expected, the separation between binding
constants for e.g. tripolyphosphate pentaanion and hydro-
genphosphate dianion increases from Dlog K = 1.9 to 6.6 on
going from monoprotonated to tetraprotonated spermine (the
Dlog K values predicted from eqn (11) are 1.8 and 7.3,
respectively).
4.2 Shape selectivity and dependence of experimentally observed
selectivity on pH and on concentrations
Classical
examples
for
selective
binding
due
to
shape
differences between spherical and non-spherical anions, or
between dicarboxylic acids of varying length, mainly due to
Lehn et al, can be found in recent books1 and reviews,
particularly on anion complexation.14
In spite of low directionality of charge-charge interactions,
significant shape selectivity can be observed in recognition of
ionic compounds in sufficiently rigid systems. The results for
recognition of a series of tricarboxylates 1–5 by protonated
forms of the macrocycle 6 illustrate this point.15

Fig. 5 shows the logarithms of stability constants for
complexes of trianions with increasingly more protonated
forms of the macrocycle. Plots are roughly linear with positive
slopes, but for a given degree of protonation of the macrocycle
the constants are significantly different in spite of the similar
charge of all guest anions. Binding of all rigid anions is
stronger
than
that
of
the
flexible
citrate
(5)
and
the
discrimination between anions becomes more pronounced on
increase in the macrocycle charge, again in accordance with
expected selectivity–affinity correlation.
Molecular modeling confirmed that the shape selectivity
arises
here
from
different
degree
of
matching
between
carboxylate and ammonium groups. Several other systems
for selective ion pairing with isomeric polycarboxylates based
on the same principle have been reported.15
Further search for a more efficient receptor for citrate (5)
lead to development of a C3-symmetric tricationic host 7,
which binds citrate with log Kassoc #5 in water, but lacks the
shape selectivity and does not discriminate rigid and flexible
guests: binding constants for trianions 1, 3 and 5 decrease in
the order 1 . 5 . 3, but vary just within a factor of three.16
Discrimination of polyatomic anions such as carboxylates,
phosphates, sulfate etc. in water is usually achieved by hosts
with complementary and geometrically matching cationic
functions as illustrated by a recent example of recognition
of anions by a dicopper complex of cryptand 8, [Cu2
II(8)]4+,
Fig. 6.17 Although in this case the cationic sites are created
by a transition metal ion, affinities of anions do not follow
stability constants of their Cu(II) complexes. Also, basicity,
shape and size of anions are not important factors. The best
correlation is observed with the ‘‘bite length’’ of anions defined
as a distance between two terminal donor atoms of the anion.
Anions with bite length, which fits the distance between two
Cu(II) ions in axial positions of the cryptand in its most stable
conformation show the highest affinities.

The confined space in macrocyclic hosts such as 9 (X =
(CH2)n, n = 6 or 8) lead to stable complexes with halides and
with cyanide (K [in M21] Cl = 270; Br = 2150; I = 6500) in
water, where bromide and iodide binding is enthalpically
driven.14d
Selective complexation of natural carbohydrates poses
particular problems,18 as hydrogen bonding is very weak
in water and needs help by ion pairing. In 30% water in
DMSO glucuronic acid 10a binds with the host 7 with Kassoc =
480 M21, the isomeric galacturonic acid 10b binds three
times stronger; with sugar phosphates instead of carboxylate
the associations become much stronger, but any selectivity
disappears.16b
An interesting aspect related to systems as discussed above is
the question of the experimentally observed selectivity in terms
of actual proportion of complexed to uncomplexed substrate
or analyte as a function of pH and of host concentrations. We
will first address the influence of pH on actual affinities, which
plays a significant role if the charge of either cation or anion,
or of both, depend on the degree of protonation. Results in
Fig. 5 show that the binding constants for e.g. isomers 3 and 4
differ by two to four orders of magnitude and those for 4
surpass those for citrate by the same factor starting from
pentaprotonated macrocycle. However, this does not mean
that the fractions of bound anions at a given pH will differ by
the same factors because all three anions have different
basicities (pKa of the monoprotonated forms of anions 3–5
equal 7.3, 6.9 and 5.4, respectively) and in the acid medium
necessary for the macrocycle protonation each anion will be
protonated to a different degree. A better parameter is the so-
called apparent or conditional stability constant Kapp defined
in terms of total bound and free concentrations of components
(A is the anion and R is the macrocyclic receptor):15

(12)
The calculated values of Kapp for anions 3–5 are plotted vs.
pH in Fig. 7.19 Under conditions when the complexation
degree is directly proportional to the binding constant the
selectivity is just the ratio of Kapp, e.g. at pH 4 the selectivity
for 3 vs. 4 is 100, and for 3 vs. 5 it is 1500.
It is often overlooked that the concentrations used in an
experiment always influences the actual proportion of com-
plexed to free analyte. The complexation degree generally is
not directly proportional to the binding constant. Under
conditions of low concentrations, where such proportionality
does exist, one finds only a small fraction of the bound ligand,
which will then reduce the determination sensitivity of the
analyte. Fig. 8 shows the pH-profiles of the complexation
degree for 1 mM solutions of the same three anions in the
presence of 1 mM 6, which is a sufficiently high receptor
concentration for nearly quantitative binding of 3 at low pH.
Evidently the real discrimination is significantly poorer than
one would expect on basis of Kapp because other anions also
are bound to the receptor by 20–70%.
5 Ion pairs in non-aqueous medium
The implementation of ionic sites into organic residues allows
one to obtain in non-aqueous media larger affinities, which,

however, do not necessarily lead to higher selectivities. The
cationic
receptors
11a,b,
Scheme
2,
show
a
moderate
preference for chloride over bromide. The more basic anions
F2 and CH3COO2, when present in excess, induce deprotona-
tion of the pyrrole NH groups, and also therefore lead to
equilibria with other stoichiometries than 1 : 1. Since the larger
Cl2 anion can in contrast to the small F2 anion approach all
three cationic residues the trifurcate host 11b is exceptional by
its distinct preference for chloride over fluoride.14b
Ion pairing with the imidazolinium host 12 leads in
DMSO to the surprisingly large value of KCl/KBr .74,
with K = 740 M21 for Cl2.20 The guanidinium receptor 13
uses three phosphonate acceptor groups to bind with high
selectivity e.g. the side group of arginin.21
Ditopic receptors can make use of additional interactions
between two different guest compounds entrapped in a host,
which in particular with binding of salts leads to increased
selectivity (Scheme 3)14,22 Thus, the host 14 binds Na+ and K+
as tetraphenylborates in DMSO with similar affinities (5 and
8 M21, respectively), but addition of Bu4NCl increases binding
constant for K+ to 340 M21, and that for Na+ only to 25 M21
creating a more than 10-fold differentiation between the
cations.22d The reason for this effect is that the smaller
chloride fits into the receptor cavity, providing additional
electrostatic attraction to the cation, but the effect is much
smaller for sodium because binding of this cation changes the
conformation of azacrown in such way that oxygen atoms of
the macrocycle approach the chloride creating significant ion–
dipole repulsion.
6 Hydrogen bonded complexes
Interactions between species possessing H-donor D and
H-acceptor A sites can be described quantitatively in terms
of eqn (9) or (10) derived for CCl4 solutions.23
DGRL = 2.43CACD + 5.70
(13)
log KRL = 7.354a2
Hb2
H 2 1.094
(14)
If receptor is e.g. a proton donor the selectivity for ligands
with proton acceptor sites will be given by eqn (15) or (16).
DDGRL = 2.43CD(R){CA(X) 2 CB(Y)}
(15)
Dlog KRL = 7.354a2
H(R){b2
H(X) 2 b2
H(Y)}
(16)
Thus discrimination between basic ligands will increase on
going from receptor bearing an aliphatic OH group (a2
H = 0.4)
to receptor bearing a carboxyl group (a2
H = 0.6) by a factor of
1.5 in terms of Dlog KRL according to eqn (16).
Donor groups such as amides, ureas etc allow to construct
host compounds in which affinity and selectivity can be
controlled by the number of interactions and the size of the
host cavity, analogous to the ionic complexes in aqueous
media which we discussed above. In addition, hydrogen bonds
distinguish themselves from other non-covalent interactions by
their pronounced directionality.24 For a systematic com-
parison of selectivity and affinities, and later of solvent effects,
we first concentrate on the complexation of halide anions,
which as guests are free from directional restrictions, and for
which sufficient literature data are available.14 Also, we restrict
the analysis on associations with electroneutral host structures.
Simultaneous ionic interactions render the mechanistic inter-
pretation more complex, and generally also lead to smaller
selectivity than those based on hydrogen bonding alone.
Open-chain hydrogen bond donor arrays provide syntheti-
cally simple yet often already selective host compounds for
anions. The examples shown in Scheme 425 support the notion
that selectivity increases with affinity, due to the increased
number n of interactions.
Due to the intrinsic hydrogen bonds acceptor strength
decreasing from fluoride to iodide, even a simple donor
molecule such as methanol shows in absence of competing
solvent molecules already large selectivity in the gas phase,
with KCl/KBr = 17 (KCl = 2.6 6 107 M21), or KBr/KI = 56
(KBr = 1.3 6 106 M21).11
Steroid skeletons allow to mount hydrogen bond donor
functions such as urea in highly organized manner, 18, which
lead to high affinity with many anions, with K values of up to
1011 M21 (for chloride, in chloroform).2 However, the highest
selectivity was with KCl/KBr = 9 just in the range of that with

with a system of smaller affinity (K around 108 M21). If one
analyzes all binding constants with such steroid-based urea
hosts, omitting one where an ester group is used instead of
urea, one finds, however, correlations between affinity and
selectivities, which are satisfactorily linear, with larger slopes
for pairs of anions more distant in their basicities, e.g. the slope
for ClO4
2/Cl2 is 0.51 compared to 0.088 for Br2/Cl2 (Fig. 9).
With non-symmetrical anions such as acetate or ethanesulfo-
nate there is no general correlation, likely due to steric effects
(see ESI{).
Anion receptors containing indole as hydrogen bond donors
show selectivities, which simultaneously with the affinity
are increased with a increasing number of donor sites, and
culminate if the maximum of four donor units are within
a sterically very constrained cavity, Scheme 5.26 This is
illustrated with a series of host compounds; the last one
being exhibiting very high binding constant with fluoride
(K = 5.6 6 108 M21 in MeCN). High selectivities with these
hosts are also retained in polar media such as acetone (see
Section 9 on Solvent effects).
If complexation is supported by e.g. electrostatic interac-
tions, hydrogen bonding can also be used in aqueous medium
for selective recognition of peptides with the host 22, as shown
in Scheme 6.27
As seen already with the last example in Scheme 5
macrocyclic cavities allow a significant selectivity increase.
This is also true if the cavity is so large, that large ions such as
iodide are with 23 preferred over those with higher charge
density, in contrast to the usual sequence (Scheme 7).28
Smaller cavities such as in calix[4]pyrroles 24 show the
expected preference for small ions, e.g. KF/KCl = 50, or
KCl/KBr = 35 in dichloromethane29 (Scheme 8). It should be
noted that in acetonitrile, however, a much smaller KF/Cl = 1.8
was reported.30 Calorimetric measurements of such complexes
brought partially conflicting results, depending in some
cases also on the mode of addition. The corresponding

thio-derivatives 25,31 which have been studied in detail with
respect to solvent effects (see below) exhibit the expected,
although moderate selectivities. Macrocyclic tetraamides (26,
Scheme 8) yielded with e.g. KCl/KBr # 13 a remarkable
selectivity even in the more competitive solvent DMSO.32
The macrocyclic peptide 27 represents a rare case of anion
complexation by pure hydrogen bonding in water, with
preference for iodide and in particular for sulfate; both 1 : 1
and 2 : 1 complexes were observed and characterized by e.g.
NMR spectroscopy.33
The directionality of hydrogen bonds is the basis for systems
which discriminate e.g. spherical anions from e.g. carboxylate,
can be illustrated with the bis-urea host 23, well suited to
discriminate carboxylates from other anions.34
With the macrocyclic host 23 binding equilibria with HSO4
2
and H2PO4
2 were even slow on the NMR time scale.28
Guanidinium groups (29) serve the same purpose, but also
show favorable interactions with e.g. phosphate or sulfate.14,35
Three converging hydrogen bonds are used in the complex 30
for selective binding of nitrate anions.35 Multiple hydrogen
bonds lead with a boron-complex to binding constants with
phosphate exceeding those with e.g. carboxylate by a factor
over 100.36

where hydrophobic forces can also contribute. Most often
these associations comprise aromatic units;37 their stacking or
edge-to-face binding modes can involve Coulombic, cation–p
and dispersive interactions. As a rule it is difficult to exactly
separate for such supramolecular associations specific binding
mechanisms; for this reason and for practical considerations
we
will
treat
the
selectivity
aspects
for
corresponding
complexes together in one section. Our major aim is to
illustrate how different kinds of such interactions can be used
for selective complexations.
An electron rich cyclophane host shows only moderate
selectivity of e.g. phenyl derivatives with different substituents,
for which both by electrostatic stacking face-to-face as well as
edge-to-face are responsible (Scheme 9).37 Noticeably, the
selectivity in terms of enthalpy differences DDH is much more
pronounced than that in DDG, which are to large degree
compensated by adverse entropic contributions. In such cases
one can expect higher selectivities at higher temperature, due
to the TDS term, which shows at room temperature already
differences of up to D(TDS) = 13 kJ mol21.
Fully aromatic clefts or tweezers (Scheme 10) can serve by
predominantly electrostatic forces as hosts only for electron-
deficient neutral and cationic substrates.38 This is due to the
quite negative partial charge on the concave side of these
hydrocarbons. An application of this type of interaction for
selective binding of lysine and arginine in water was reported
by using a phosphonate appended dianionic tweezer.39
All of the above-mentioned mechanisms can lead to affinity
increase with the contact surface between host and guest.
Selectivity with respect to the size of e.g. an aromatic guest
molecule can therefore be achieved not only by inclusion in
geometrically matching host cavities, but simply also by
interaction with a flat host surface, as illustrated with affinity
difference
in
associations
with
water-soluble
porphyrins
(Scheme 11).40
In contrast to the negligible influence of heteroatoms as part
of a p-system (Scheme 11) heteroatoms can be distinguished
better if they are in substituents at other molecules, as
illustrated
in
Scheme
12,
again
with
simple
porphyrin
complexes. Here binding constants between e.g. p-halogeno
and p-nitro benzoates differ by a factors of up to about 10, and
obviously reflect the influence of polarizability on dispersive
interactions. Regioisomers with heterosubstituents either in
m- or p-position cannot be distinguished, whereas those
in o-position lead to steric distortions and thus to affinity
changes. Contributions of aliphatic groups here are obviously
negligible, but can be sizeable in complexes dominated by
hydrophobic interactions such as cyclodextrins (see below).
The selective recognition of amino acids and peptides is of
significance for many applications; ion pairing provides a
increasingly used way for the distinction of basic and acidic
amino
acid
residues,42
whereas
hydrogen
bonding
can
essentially used only in non-aqueous media with protected
amino acids. Dispersive interactions are of major significance
for the distinction of lipophilic amino acids, as illustrated in
Scheme 13 with a sequence-selective host for tripeptides. The

length-selective, allows a favourable binding contribution only
if the complementary amino acid with a side chain RG is in the
center position of the peptide, other positions are discrimi-
nated by up to ten times smaller binding constants.43
The selective binding of aromatic peptide residues can be
improved by implementation of a nitro group into the host 31
which in line with the dispersive effects discussed above
enhances the affinity constant by a power of magnitude.44
High
affinity

with
significant
selectivity
for
recognition of N-terminal tryptophan in water was achieved
by using as a host cucurbit[8]uril (Q8) in combination with
methyl viologen (MV), Scheme 14.45
The mechanism of recognition involves formation of ternary
complexes (Q8–MV–guest) held together by a combined action
of electrostatic interactions of terminal peptide ammonium
groups or free amino acid with carbonyl groups of Q8 as well
as the face-to-face interaction of indole ring with the included
MV dication. The receptor binds aromatic amino acids with a
clear preference for tryptophan and also recognizes peptides
with N-terminal tryptophan.
The macrocyclic peptidocalix[4]arene 32 exhibits significant
selectivity for aryl- over alkyl carboxylates due to p–p-stacking
interactions. In addition, the presence of chiral amino acids in
the host leads to moderate enantioselectivity with N-protected
amino acids as guest molecules.46 Solubility reasons prevent
the use of water as solvent, where larger selectivity can be
expected.

8 Hydrophobically driven cyclodextrin complexes
Cyclodextrin complexes are considered to be typical examples
of hydrophobically driven associations, although it is known
that depending particularly on the polarizability of the guest
molecule dispersive interactions can dominate. As an example
we shall consider the binding of alcohols to cyclodextrins. As
shown in Fig. 10 there is a good correlation of log K values
for linear 1-alcohols vs. number n of carbon atoms, reflecting
a constant binding increment per methylene group and the
generally higher affinity with the smaller and hence better size-
fitting a-cyclodextrin. The selectivity of binding of alcohols
with different chain length is approximately constant for both
cyclodextrins with K increasing by a factor of three on addition
of each methylene group to an alcohol. Changing the shape of
the guest e.g. by using tert-BuOH instead of n-BuOH strongly
affects the binding (Fig. 10): with the larger b-CD the fit
becomes better and K increases by a factor of 20, but with
smaller a-CD the fit is poorer and K even decreases by a factor
of 2.5.
Typically the cyclodextrin is modified by attaching of a
signaling e.g. fluorescent moiety, like e.g. in structure 33,47 to
convert it to a sensor. Such modification of course may affect
the binding. The open triangles in Fig. 10 show the binding
constants of the same 1-alcohols to 33. Evidently the affinity is
strongly reduced by the modification (the effect attributed to
the steric hindrance), however, the slope of log K vs. n is the
same, as one would expect for this type of interaction. So, the
modified cyclodextrin provides the same selectivity in spite of
reduced affinity.
More perfect biological receptors often provide larger
binding increments per methylene and therefore may afford
a better selectivity. As an example, Fig. 10 shows the binding
constants for a series of 1-alcohols to a major urinary protein
MUP-1.48 The binding increment here is twice as that with
cyclodextrins: K increases by a factor of 7 per additional
methylene group. Also the absolute values of binding con-
stants are ca. two orders of magnitude larger, thus providing
another example of increased selectivity with increased affinity.
9 Solvent effects
According to eqn (3) any solvent leading to smaller affinity of
complexation should lead to a decrease of selectivity, as
smaller DG values would be reflected in concomitantly smaller
free energy difference DDG. Therefore quantitative correla-
tions between affinity and solvent properties should be helpful
for the prediction of selectivity, which may be enhanced by
proper choice of a solvent. Unfortunately, the influence of the
reaction medium on supramolecular equilibria is often difficult
to quantify.
9.1 Solvent effects on ionophore complexes
With ion complexes and electroneutral ligands one can expect
the major variation from solvation or desolvation of the most
polar partner. Indeed, it has been realized since long time ago
that the hole-size peak selectivity of metal ion complexation by
crown ethers and related ligands is observed to the great extent
due to the cation solvation effect. For complexation between
potassium salts and 18-crown-6 in 14 different solvents one
observes a linear correlation (with R #0.95) of DG with
standard Gibbs transfer energies DGut of the metal ion from
water to the given solvent.9a Comparison with some other
cations and ligands, including [222]cryptand, also revealed,
that the complexation constant changes are essentially a linear
function of the cation desolvation free energies. Less mean-
ingful correlations (R # 0.9) are obtained with values
characterizing the electron donor capacity of the solvent.
Parameters characterizing the solvent polarity, such as ET, are
extremely poor descriptors (R = 0.3). Reaction enthalpies DH
vary much more than DG, for instance from 12 kJ mol21 (in
MeCN) to 68 kJ mol21 (in Me2CHOH), without meaningful
correlations to any known solvent properties.9a
Both theoretical calculations49 and experimental gas-phase
measurements50 show that in the absence of a solvent the
affinity of cations to crown ethers of different sizes always
parallels the cation charge density, i.e. the highest affinity
is always observed for Li+ among alkali metal ions and for
Mg2+ among alkaline-earth cations. Recent measurements of
stability constants for alkali metal ions in poorly solvating
nitromethane indeed show the expected order Na+ . K+ .
Rb+ . Cs+ regardless of the macrocycle size.51
As expected, measurements in different solvents usually
show a decreased affinity in more polar solvents due to
stronger solvation of metal ions. This in principle may lead to

b-cyclodextrin (open and solid squares respectively), to naphthalene

an observation of affinity-selectivity correlation, which indeed
can be found in several cases, e.g.. for complexation of alkali
metal ions with [221]cryptand (data from ref. 10) and with a
bibracchial lariat ether 34,52 see Fig. 11.
Recent results on solvent effects on cation and anion
recognition with large polyfunctional receptors point to
importance of co-complexation of solvent molecules with
guests for affinity and selectivity.
Studies on the cation binding by a calixarene 3553 in four
solvents (MeCN, MeOH, DMF and propylene carbonate
(PC)) show that in MeOH and DMF one observes the binding
of only two cations, Ag+ and Hg2+, surprisingly with inversed
selectivity (KAg & KHg in MeOH, but KHg . KAg in DMF).
However in MeCN the receptor binds a large number of
cations (Li+, Na+, Ag+, Ca2+, Pb2+, Hg2+ and Cu2+) with
strongly increased affinity to Hg2+, but decreased affinity to
Ag+ as compared to MeOH and DMF. This stronger binding
in MeCN cannot be attributed just to lower donor number
(DN) of this solvent because in PC, which is even less donor
solvent, receptor 35 does not bind cations at all. It has been
shown that inclusion of a MeCN molecule in the cavity formed
by aromatic rings of 35 causes an allosteric effect inducing a
widening of the cavity formed by polar chains where metal ion
binding occurs; this makes possible complexation of a large
number of cations in this solvent.
Another
example
of
co-complexation
with
a
solvent
molecule strongly affecting the selectivity was observed in
recognition of anions by a porphyrinic receptor 36.54 The
binding of chloride and dihydrogenphosphate was studied in
two solvents, DMSO and CH2Cl2. In DMSO, KCl .105 M21
and KH2PO4 = 1.4 6 103 M21, but in CH2Cl2, the affinity to
chloride goes down (KCl = 1.5 6 103 M21) while that to
dihydrogenphosphate goes up (KH2PO4 = 1.8 6 104 M21), thus
inverting the selectivity. Addition of DMSO to CH2Cl2
improves binding of chloride. Although the fact of binding
of
a
DMSO
molecule
to
the
receptor
was
confirmed
independently by X-ray crystallography, the role of this bound
molecule remains rather obscure. Changes in anion solvation
also can contribute to the inverted selectivity: the protic
hydrogenphosphate should be better solvated in the proton
acceptor DMSO than in CH2Cl2; this may reduce the affinity
in the former solvent, but chloride should be better solvated
in more proton donor CH2Cl2 than in aprotic DMSO, and
therefore show lower affinity with the former solvent.
Binding constants of 18C6 with protonated amines in water,
2-propanol, tert-butyl alcohol, n-octanol, DMF, DMSO,
pyridine and HMPT have been found to vary by factors of
up to 1000; the solvent effects can be described with values
characterizing the electron donor capacity of the solvent.
Although no linear dependence of the difference Dlog K
between benzylammonium and anilinium chloride on the total
affinity was observed, somewhat larger Dlog K values were
found with less competing solvents.55
9.2 Solvent effects on hydrogen bonded complexes
In complexation based on hydrogen bonds the selectivity is
generally larger in solvents with smaller donor or acceptor
capacities, although a linear correlation between affinity and
selectivity is rarely seen. Jeong et al. have recently carried out a
systematic study of solvent effects on binding constants of
halide anions with open chain indole-donor ligands 19 and 20
(see Scheme 5).26 The data (see Tables S1 and S2 in ESI{)
demonstrate impressively how a suitable choice of the solvent
allows to optimize selectivities, reaching with the simple
bisindole host 19 e.g. KCl/KBr = 6 in MeCN, or 16 in THF.
With the still conformationally flexible tetraindole 20 not only
the affinities are significantly increased (see above), but the
selectivities reach peak values of KCl/KBr = 140 in MeCN, or
120 even in the polar medium acetone. For KBr/KI the peak
values are 2300, now in CD2Cl2, or 1900, surprisingly again in
acetone. The binding constants, which do not correlate with

any known solvent property parameters, show the expected
increased selectivities comparing the bisindole with tetraindole
as host (see section Hydrogen bonded complexes), but the
correlation between affinity and selectivity is much less clear in
the comparison of different reaction media. In particular, high
selectivities are observed in acetone, which due to its polarity
does not lead to particular strong complexation. That specific
solvation effects play a more important role than just the
change of total affinity with the solvent is also seen in halide
anion complexation with diphenylurea as ligand (see Table S3
in ESI{), where again a peak selectivity of KCl/KBr = 15 is
reached in acetone.
A significant change in relative affinity of protic and aprotic
anions to a bicyclic polypeptide antibiotic thiostrepton was
observed on going from DMSO to chloroform.56 In DMSO,
affinities follow the order of increased basicity of anions (F2 =
AcO2 & H2PO4
2, Cl2, Br2, HSO4
2), but in chloroform
the pattern is more complex: Cl2 = HSO4
2 . F2 . AcO2 .
Br2 . H2PO4
2. The strongly increased affinity to HSO4
2 is
attributed to its ability to bind to the host as a proton donor.
10 Chiral recognition: an outlook
Since the classical use of binaphthyl crown ethers 38 for the
discrimination of enantiomeric amino acid derivatives by
Cram and co-workers,57 hundreds of investigations have
addressed selective recognition of chiral substrates;58 it is out
of the scope of the present review to discuss any examples in
detail. Significant progress has been made by coupling
discriminating chiral units to primary recognition sites, in line
with Scheme 1. With a host such as 39 aromatic amino acids
can be bound selectively by a combination of ion pairing to the
guanidinium residue, of hydrogen binding to the crown ether,
and of p–p stacking to the naphthyl units.59
It should be noticed that for the chiral recognition site a
binding free energy difference DDG of e.g. 10 kJ mol21
between association with one over the other isomer is sufficient
to reach a selectivity ratio around 100, whereas the primary
binding site, e.g. a crown ether or a guanidinium unit, may
contribute much higher binding energy; in consequence,
the correlation between selectivity and total affinity can
completely
break
down
for
such
cases.
For
additional
examples and information see ESI.{
11 Conclusions
The design of a selective receptor usually is focused on
complementarity of interacting host and guest sites, pre-
organization and choosing of a proper interaction type
(e.g. stacking interactions for selective binding of aromatic
vs. aliphatic guests). However, since the selectivity is a balance
of numerous aspects affecting the binding, the influence of
such factors as solvent effects or secondary, both attractive
and repulsive, interactions cannot be underestimated. The
situation becomes even more complicated if one considers a
real experimentally observed selectivity in terms of different
complexation degrees under chosen conditions rather than the
simple ratio of binding constants.
If only one type of interaction mode prevails one can expect
to see a general correlation between selectivity and total
affinity. Both selectivity and affinity can gain from multi-
valency by augmentation of the number of binding sites, even
in poorly preorganized flexible receptors. One may consider
selectivity–affinity correlations as an analog of the once
popular reactivity–selectivity principle, which nowadays is
often criticized for lack of generality and an absence of a firm
theoretical basis.60 As we saw, however, the selectivity–affinity
correlation can be justified theoretically for certain types of
interactions and its limitations also can be predicted satisfac-
torily. The role of secondary interaction sites for discrimina-
tion
between
different
analytes
is
the
most
important
limitation of linear affinity–selectivity correlations. On the
other hand, the introduction of such secondary interaction
sites holds much promise for the development of highly
selective supramolecular hosts, where a primary interaction
site can simultaneously and independently provide for high
affinities.
