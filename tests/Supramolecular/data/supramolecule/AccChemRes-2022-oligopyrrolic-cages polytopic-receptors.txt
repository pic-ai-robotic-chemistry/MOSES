Oligopyrrolic Cages: From Classic Molecular Constructs to
Chemically Responsive Polytopic Receptors
CONSPECTUS: “Functional molecular systems”, discrete and self-assembled constructs
where control over molecular recognition, structure, bonding, transport, release, catalytic
activity, etc., is readily achieved, are a topic of current interest. Within this broad paradigm,
oligopyrrolic cages have garnered attention due to their responsive recognition features. Due
to the presence of slightly polar pyrrole subunits which can also behave as hydrogen-bonding
donors, these oligopyrrolic cages are potential receptors for various polarized species. In this
Account, we summarize recent advances involving the syntheses and study of (1) covalent
oligopyrrolic macrobicyclic cages, (2) oligopyrrolic metallacages, and (3) oligopyrrolic
noncovalently linked cages. Considered in concert, these molecular constructs have allowed
advances in applied supramolecular chemistry; to date, they have been exploited for selective
guest encapsulation studies, anion binding and ion-channel formation, and gas absorption,
among other applications. While key ﬁndings from others will be noted, in this Account will
focus on our own contributions to the chemistry of discrete oligopyrrolic macrocycles and
their use in supramolecular host−guest chemistry and sensing applications. In terms of speciﬁcs, we will detail how oligopyrrole
cages with well-deﬁned molecular geometries permit reversible guest binding under ambient conditions and how the incorporation
of pyrrole subunits within larger superstructures allows eﬀective control over anion/conjugate acid binding activity under ambient
conditions. We will also provide examples that show how derivatization of these rudimentary macrocyclic cores with various
sterically congested β-substituted oligopyrroles can provide entry into more complex supramolecular architectures. In addition, we
will detail how hybrid systems that include heterocycles other than pyrrole, such as pyridine and naphthyridine, can be used to create
self-assembled materials that show promise as gas-absorbing materials and colorimetric reversible sensors. Studies involving
oligopyrrolic polymetallic cages and oligopyrrolic supramolecular cages will also be reviewed. First, we will discuss all-carbon-linked
oligopyrrolic bicycles and continue on to present systems linked via amines and imines linkages. Finally, we will summarize recent
work on pyrrolic cages created through the use of metal centers or various noncovalent interactions. We hope that this Account will
provide researchers with an initial foundation for understanding oligopyrrolic cage chemistry, thereby allowing for further advances
in the area. It is expected that the fundamental design and recognition principles made in the area of oligopyrrole cages, as
exempliﬁed by our contributions, will be of general use to researchers targeting the design of functional molecular systems. As such,
we have structured this Account so as to summarize the past while setting the stage for the future.

to produce symmetric three-dimensional (3D) oligopyr-
rolic cryptands for potential applications in the area of gas
adsorption. This latter application had not previously
been explored with pyrrolic cage systems.
This report is
signiﬁcant because it demonstrated the reversible
“capture” and “release” of dicarboxylic acid guests using
a fully organic self-assembled cage-like pyrrolic receptor.
Both the supramolecular recognition and the correspond-
ing assembly and disassembly processes were reﬂected in
visible color changes.


1. INTRODUCTION
This Account is concerned with the chemistry of pyrrolic cage
systems. Cages of this general class have been the focus of
increasing attention since the late 1990s. However, in many
respects the antecedents for work in this area can be traced to the
revolutionary report of laterally symmetric macrobicyclic
“cryptands”5 and “cryptates”6 by Lehn et al. in 1969 as well as
the 1968 report of Simmons and Park of anion binding within a
bicyclic diammonium construct.7 A spotlight was shown on the
cryptands with the awarding of a share of the 1987 Nobel Prize
in Chemistry to Lehn, who codiﬁed “supramolecular chemistry”
as the chemistry beyond the molecule.8 To date, more than 2000
papers have detailed the synthesis, derivatization, and
application of cryptands and their supramolecular complexes
to problems running the gamut from fundamental to applied.
This activity reﬂects in large measure the fact that these
macrobicyclic hosts can act as artiﬁcial synthetic organic (or
metal−organic hybrid) receptors for a wide variety of ionic
guests, including protons (H+) and ammonium (NH4
+, R2NH2
+,
etc.), alkali, alkaline earth, transition metal, and actinide cations,
along with various negatively charged anionic species. The
speciﬁcs of binding depend, not surprisingly, on the structural
features, geometries, functionalities, and electronic environ-
ments (e.g., neutral or charged) provided by the cryptand host
with guest binding being seen within the internal cavities or
outside clefts or both.
Incorporation of pyrroles into bicyclic frameworks creates
cryptand-like frameworks that can act as potential functional
materials. This functionality can be augmented by including
other heterocycles, such as pyridine or naphthyridine, within the
superstructures.3,9 Incorporation of chelating units can provide
for metal-based self-assembly, while the use of β-substituted
oligopyrroles can support the formation of complex supra-
molecular architectures. As a class, oligopyrrolic macrocyclic
cages have been explored for a wide variety of functions,
including use as potential receptors, sensors, and gas storage
systems. The goal of this Account is to review our contributions
to this area within the framework of the ﬁeld as a whole.
Excluded from this Account will be double-walled and
multiwalled bis-calix[4]pyrroles since they have been the subject
of recent reviews.10,11


2. COVALENT OLIGOPYRROLIC MACROBICYCLIC
CAGES
In 2001, Sessler et al. reported a cryptand-like bicyclic[3,3,3]-
nonapyrrole1 (1, see Scheme 1) and investigated its anion-
binding property. In the solid state, cage 1 adopts a wind
turbine-shaped conformation with D3h symmetry in which both
of the apical CH hydrogen atoms are pointed in toward the inner
cavity (endo−endo orientation). The presence of pyrrolic NH
protons in the architecture endows cage 1 with an ability to bind
either anions or neutral molecules, such as solvents or water
(Figure 1a−c). Cage 1 interacts with these species as an exo
receptor rather than accommodating them internally as seen in
Scheme 1. Synthesis of the Oligopyrrolic Calix−Cryptand 1

and c). (d) X-ray crystal structure of the exo complex formed between receptor 1 and the neutral guest molecules H2O and CH2Cl2. Data from ref 1.

The case of most classic cryptate complexes. For instance, as
inferred from X-ray crystallographic analyses, one CH2Cl2
solvent and three water molecules are located within the three
external clefts of 1 via cooperative hydrogen-bonding, halogen-
bonding, and CH···π interactions (Figure 1d). In an eﬀort to test
the ability of cage 1 to act as an anion receptor, its interactions
with a range of anions, e.g., F−, Cl−, Br−, NO3
−, H2PO4
−, and
SCN−, were screened. A signiﬁcant downﬁeld chemical shift was
seen in the pyrrolic NH protons when cage 1 in CD2Cl2 was
subject to 1H NMR spectroscopic titrations with various tetra-n-
butylammonium (TBA) anion salts. In the representative case of
NO3
−, a fast equilibrium process and an overall Δδ = 1.1 ppm
downﬁeld shift was seen. These spectral changes were ascribed
to the formation of a 1:2 host−guest complex characterized by
association constants of K1 = 1740 M−1 and K2 = 420 M−1,
respectively. In contrast to what is seen in the case of NO3
−, F−
was found to form a 1:1 complex with 1 as inferred from a
corresponding 1H NMR spectroscopic titration. In the case of
Cl−, an overall association constant on the order of 106 M−2 in
CD2Cl2 was recorded at 298 K. Very slow exchange was seen in
the cases of H2PO4
−and SCN−(as their TBA salts) under
otherwise identical experimental conditions. 


Overall, these diﬀerences were ascribed to the combined eﬀect of size
complementary, steric, and electronic interactions.
Chemical oxidation of cage 1 by 5,6-dichloro-2,3-dicyano-p-
benzoquinone (DDQ) was found to produce an unprecedented
sp2-hybridized carbon bridgehead calixphyrin (4) (Figure 2).12
Compound 4, as a prototypical three-dimensional (3D)
calixphyrin, belongs to a class of hybrid molecular systems that
bear structural and chemical analogy to both calixpyrroles and
porphyrins owing to the presence of both sp2- and sp3-
hybridized meso-like bridging carbon atoms. Distinctive broad
absorption maxima (λmax) at 421 and 474 nm were taken as
evidence for the generation of partially oxidized species in
solution where the characteristic “porphyrin-like” features (e.g.,
an absorption spectrum containing both a sharp Soret band and
weaker “Q” bands) are absent. In contrast to what was observed
in the X-ray structure of 1 where the two bridging apical −CH
hydrogen atoms were seen to point inward (endo−endo
orientation), the sp2-hybridized bridging carbon atom produces
a degree of local planarity. The net result is that cage 4 possesses
a more open cavity (cf. Figure 2, inset) that was expected to
facilitate the “inside binding” of guests.
While this Account is mainly focused on our own
contributions, we would like to make clear that subsequent to
our initial report of bicycle 1, many elegant oligopyrrolic cages
were reported by other research groups. For instance, in 2008,
Setsune et al. reported a highly symmetric pyrrole−cryptand (8)
constructed by three dipyrrylpyridine (pyrrole−pyridine−
pyrrole hybrid system) side arms.9 The receptor was obtained
via an acid-catalyzed condensation of precursors 6 and 7 as
shown in Scheme 2.
Starting in 2011, Mani et al. reported a series of cages,
compounds 9−14 given in Chart 1,13−17 which were seen
capable of binding a number of representative anions (e.g., F−,
Cl−, Br−, NO3
−, H2PO4
−, and HSO4
−) in organic media such as
CDCl3, DMSO-d6, and (CD3)2CO under ambient conditions. A
few representative X-ray structures of the resulting anion-bound
cryptates are shown in Figure 3. In the case of cages 9 and 11a,
the F−and PO4
3−anions were found to be bound within the
cryptand cavity (cf. Figure 3a and 3d); however, most of the
other anions give rise to exo complexes (cf. Figure 3b, 3c, and
3e).
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has emerged as an
attractive and eﬃcient means for preparing intricate molecular
constructs, including macrocycles,18 cages,19−22 and covalent
organic frameworks (COFs),23,24 and has yielded a number of
systems with potential applications.25−28 Not surprisingly, DCC
has been exploited to access discrete oligopyrrolic cages. Taking
advantage of this approach, we designed and synthesized the
Schiﬀ-base macrobicyclic cage 1829 starting from a suitably
functionalized pyrrolic precursor (15) as shown in Scheme 3.

complex. (c) Bromide complex of receptor 10. (d) Phosphate complex of receptor 11a. (e) Chloride complex of receptor 12. Solvent molecules are

Scheme 3. Synthesis of Benzene Bridgehead Oligopyrrolic Cage 18

This phenyl-bridgehead oligopyrrolic cryptand cage contains
both imine (hydrogen-bonding acceptor) and amide (hydro-
gen-bonding donor) functionalities within its side arms. The
latter receptor and its analogues were explored as potential
supramolecular hosts for speciﬁc anions. It was found that cage
18 exhibits speciﬁcity toward tetrahedral oxyanions, e.g.,
H2PO4
−, HP2O7
3−, SO4
2−, and HSO4
−, in the noncompetitive
solvent chloroform at 298 K. This selectivity is reﬂected in the
calculated Ka values of 1.56 × 104 M−1 for TBAH2PO4, 1.76 ×
106 M−1 for (TBA)3HP2O7, 2.66 × 106 M−1 for (TBA)2SO4, and
4.53 × 106 M−1 for TBAHSO4, respectively.
Here, it was postulated that the amidic and pyrrolic protons
could act as hydrogen-bond donors to the oxygen atom, whereas
one or more imine nitrogen atoms could serve as hydrogen-
bond acceptors for the OH protons present in H2PO4
−. As
inferred from single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis, the
H2PO4
−anion was found to be nestled within the cavity of
cage 18 and apparently was stabilized by such interactions
(Figure 4b).
A similar [1 + 1] Schiﬀ-base condensation reaction between
the phenyl-bridgehead trialdehyde (20) and the triamine (16)
allowed the macrobicyclic imine cage 21 to be synthesized
(Scheme 4a).30 In contrast to what was observed in the case of
cage 18, the alkyl−imine-linked system 21 was characterized by
selectivity for the ﬂuoride anion, as evidenced by Ka values of
1.01 × 107 M−1 for TBAF for cage 21 vs 1.57 × 106 M−1 for
amide−imine cage 18 determined by the absorption spectro-
scopic titration method at 298 K. This selectivity was ascribed to
the rigidity and comparatively smaller cavity size of cage 21 as
compared to 18. When cage 21 was exposed to F−and various
competing anions, e.g., Cl−, Br−, I−, HCO3
−, SO4
2−, H2PO4
−,
and HP2O7
3−, only F−produced an appreciable chemical shift in
the 1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3 at 298 K. Unexpectedly, cage
21 was able to retain the trapped ﬂuoride anion within its cavity
even after deprotonation of one or two of the receptor pyrrolic
NH protons as evidenced by the 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopic
analyses conducted in DMSO-d6 at 298 K. The proposed
ﬂuoride-binding modes expected to pertain within the cavity of
cryptand 21 upon the incremental addition, e.g., >1.66 equiv) of
TBAF are shown in Scheme 4b.
Prior to our own contributions, but likewise based on the
concept of dynamic imine chemistry, Roelens et al.
reported31−33 a series of self-assembled polypyrrolic benzene-
bridgehead cryptand receptors (22−24) (Chart 2). Among this
series of receptors, cage 22 was found to recognize β-
glucopyranosides with high speciﬁcity. This cryptand receptor
provides six primary amino groups for complementary hydro-
gen-bonding interactions with this particular carbohydrate, as
inferred from 1H NMR spectroscopic analyses (CDCl3, 298 K).
Consistent with this rationale, replacement of the pyrrole
subunits in 22 by pyridines and benzenes to produce the
isostructural cages 23 and 24 was found to give rise to a reduced
level of guest recognition.32,33


Porous organic cages (POCs) have garnered attention as
examples of self-assembled architectures. They often display
unique guest binding properties, such as the capture of
substrates within inﬁnite channels. This has made them of
potential interest in the context of many applications, including
gas storage,34−37 catalyses,38−40 and guest separation41−45 to
name a few. In many instances, dynamic covalent chemistry has
been used to access POCs. This is true in the case of pyrrole-

Scheme 4. Synthetic Route to Cage 21 and Its Proposed F−Binding Mode

Based systems where, for instance, several of the present authors
reported recently a series of oligopyrrolic imine cages (27−31)
that were found to act as shape-persistent porous organic
materials.3,46 These relatively large oligopyrrolic cryptands were
prepared via [3 + 2] Schiﬀ-base condensations using various
diformyl pyrrole precursors (25, 7, and 26) in conjunction with
tripodal amines (viz. [tris-2-aminoethyl)amine], TREN, or
1,3,5-triethyl-2,4,6-trimethylamine], 16) in anhydrous meth-
anol with the choice of pyrrole−dialdehyde and triamine
precursors (Scheme 5) serving to dictate the size of the resulting
cryptand-like systems. Note: The numbers in brackets reﬂect the
number of components involved in the reaction.
Careful examination of the single-crystal X-ray structures of
cryptands 27, 29, and 30 revealed key structural diﬀerences
within what was ostensibly a closely matched set of ligands. For
example, cage 27 possesses a pseudospherical inner cavity (see
Figure 5a). In the case of cryptand 29, the pyridine nitrogen
atoms “point” toward the inner core. This results in a
compressed molecX-ray diﬀraction structure of the dihydrogen
phosphateular geometry (cf. Figure 5b). However, in case of
cryptand 30, the naphthyridine nitrogen atoms face out from
what is a relatively elongated molecular cage (cf. Figure 5c).
Inspired by Atwood, Cooper, and Mastalerz, who reported
independently the gas adsorption features of porous amorphous
noria and imine cages,47−51 the pyrrolic bicycles 27−31 were

studied as possible gas capture systems. While diﬀerences among
these cages were seen, in all cases, a preference for CO2 over
other tested gases (viz. N2, H2, O2, and CH4) was observed. This
ﬁnding was rationalized in terms of its higher polarizability
relative to other gases (see Figure 6). Interestingly, at the time of
the study (2019−2020), gas capture was a potential application
for pyrrolic cages that apparently had yet to be explored.
3. OLIGOPYRROLIC METALLACAGES
Coordination chemistry-based approaches were also explored
by Sessler et al. in an eﬀort to construct pyrrolic nanocages.2,52
Here, chemically labile Zn(II) metal salts (i.e., Zn (acac)2 and
Zn(OAc)2, respectively, where acac = acetylacetonoate and OAc
= acetate) were tested in combination with an inherently
nonlinear pyridine-fused oligopyrrolic dicarboxylic acid linker
(32). Reaction of this chelate ligand 32 with Zn(acac)2 followed
by crystallization from methanol/dimethylformamide (DMF)
was found to give an octametallic cage, 33, that consists of
discrete hydroxide-bridged Zn(II) dimers (see Figure 7a and
7b). In contrast, when Zn(OAc)2 was used as the zinc(II) cation
source, an abacus type of ﬂuorescent “cage polymer” (34) was
obtained, as inferred from single-crystal X-ray crystallographic
analyses (cf. Figure 7c). The underlying chemistry is shown in
Scheme 6. This work stands as a case study in how the choice of
counteranion can serve to dictate the overall geometry of the

4. OLIGOPYRROLIC NONCOVALENTLY LINKED
CAGES
Currently, a number of organic cages53−56 prepared using
covalent bonds including, inter alia, dynamic covalent
bonds18−26,57−60 are known. These impressive contributions
have provided a springboard for the no less challenging task of
creating cage- or capsule-like systems based on noncovalent
interactions.61−68 Several of the authors of this Account have
contributed to the development of the latter theme; they
reported4,69 the all-organic self-assembled dimeric cage-like
receptors (41)2 and (42)2 (cf. Scheme 7). These supramolecular
systems, constructed from the acyclic pyridyl−/naphthyridyl−
polypyrrolic molecular building blocks 41 and 42, respectively,
are stabilized via quadruple hydrogen-bonding interactions
between individual “U”-shaped acyclic units (41 or 42).
Notably, both (41)2 and (42)2 are stable in the solid state in
CHCl3, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) solution and even in the gas phase as evidenced
from various spectroscopic analyses and single-crystal X-ray
diﬀraction studies (Figure 8). Depending on the pKa values of
the acid guests in question as determined in aqueous solution,
these self-assembled cages act as potential acid receptors. In
THF solution, receptor (41)2 was found to bind eﬀectively only
strong acids having pKa values of below ca. −1.92 (e.g.,
methanesulfonic acid (MSA), p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA),
HNO3, H2SO4, and HCl). In contrast, receptor (42)2 proved to
be an excellent receptor for biologically relevant organic
dicarboxylic acids with pKa < 2.8 in water (e.g., oxalic acid,
maleic acid, and to a lesser extent malonic acid). It was also
found to bind the same strong organic and mineral test acids that
were recognized by receptor (41)2.
It was speculated that the acids protonate the pyridyl or
naphthyridyl moieties ﬁrst, which creates a positively charged
environment within the cavity of receptors (41)2 and (42)2
suitable for counteranion recognition. However, weaker acids
(e.g., acids having pKa > 2.8 in water) were deemed unlikely to
induce this protonation even in the case of the more basic cage,
(42)2; therefore, these acids do not interact with the receptor.
On this basis, the acid capture seen in organic media was termed
“proton-coupled anion recognition”. Consistent with this
suggestion, washing the receptor−acid complexes produced
from (41)2 and (42)2 with water was found to regenerate the
corresponding pristine cage with a visible color change. This
capture and release could be repeated several times without any
degradation of the constituent receptor units.
Further studies of the pyridine-containing tetrapyrrolic
monomer 41 revealed subtleties associated with its self-
assembly. The discrete self-assembled cage form (41)2 used
for the acid capture experiments was obtained by allowing
precursor 41 to crystallize from the relatively noncoordinating
solvent CHCl3. However, when this same building block was
crystallized from more polar and presumably better coordinating
solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or DMF, an inﬁnite
“zig-zag” hydrogen-bonded network (41)n was obtained (cf.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
Macrobicyclic receptors inspired by Lehn’s seminal work on
cryptands and other early contributions to molecule recognition
continue to attract tremendous attention within the supra-
molecular community. Eﬀort is being devoted not only to
exploring new synthetic strategies, such as those based on
dynamic combinatorial chemistry and controlled metal
coordination, but also to investigating the functional properties
of the resulting systems including in the areas of selective ion
recognition, carbohydrate binding and neutral guest capture,
selective gas adsorption, and luminescent and electrochemical
sensor development to highlight a few topical themes.
Oligopyrrolic macrobicyclic systems are rather new additions
to the ever-expanding cryptand-like cage ﬁrmament. There thus
remains a large scope for further contributions in terms of both
designing and synthesizing new classes of oligopyrrolic macro-
bicyclic receptors and exploring their recognition features. New
members of this class with presumed new functions can likely be
obtained by expanding the scope of pyrrolic building blocks used
for their creation to include precursors that bear functional
groups, such as free amines or carboxylate moieties, or which
incorporate ﬂuorescent subunits. The resulting putative systems
might be expected to display enhanced recognition features or
display optical and electronic properties that would make them
of interest as sensors, redox-active or photoactive switches, or
potential ion carriers. Given these opportunities for future
contributions, in this Account, we have attempted to summarize
recent progress in the area of oligopyrrolic cryptands with a
focus on their molecular design, synthesis, self-assembly, and
potential applications. Our hope is that this summary will inspire
the further study of “chemistry within cages” and will accelerate
speciﬁcally the development of pyrrole-based cryptand-like
systems in the context of supramolecular chemistry and
materials-related research.
