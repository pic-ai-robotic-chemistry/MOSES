 Preface 
  The inclusion of small guest molecules within suitable host compounds results in con-
strained systems that imbue novel properties upon the incarcerated organic substrates. For 
example, the chromophoric nature of dye molecules is considerably altered upon com-
plexation. And the targeted delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients can be facili-
tated  in vivo . So, understandably, supramolecular tactics are becoming widely employed 
and this treatise spotlights them. Indeed, the knowledge gleaned from constructing such 
assemblies can be applied to develop innovative molecular devices. Insofar as molecular 
constraint inﬂ uences chemical reactivity, including chemo - , regio - , and stereoselectivity, 
new synthetic routes become plausible. Often, the impact of encapsulation on product 
formation is substantial. Therefore, special attention must be paid to the stabilization and 
chemistry of short - lived, high - energy intermediates, since they are key compounds that 
govern the outcome of reactions. Common among these transient species is their ability 
to subsequently undergo an array of reaction mechanisms that include the generation of 
unusual or strained products. However, the conventional drawback has been that high 
product yields are sacriﬁ ced due to a lack of selectivity across low - energy barriers. The 
use of a constrained system, however, offers the means to solve this problem by steering 
the reaction trajectory along a desired pathway. In general, we provide a broad overview 
of many different approaches that aim to manipulate chemical reactions. We anticipate 
that this endeavor will be thought provoking and ultimately facilitate the exchange of 
ideas between various scientiﬁ c disciplines. 
 This volume comprises 17 chapters. It is spearheaded by an account of molecular 
recognition being used to precisely control photochemical reactions and foster enantio-
meric excess. The supramolecular reaction proceeds under mild conditions, wherein a 
highly reactive excited - state intermediate readily generates products that are difﬁ cult to 
obtain thermally. Such inductions of enantioselectivity by chiral auxiliary are especially 
appealing. The following three chapters expound upon the cyclodextrin macrocyclic 
hosts, whose wide availability and ability to form inclusion complexes makes them mini-
ature reaction vessels  par excellence . Chapter  2 deals with the use of natural and deriva-
tized Schardinger dextrins to accelerate reactions, such as transesteriﬁ cations and 
Diels – Alder reactions, and to mimic enzymes,  e.g. , ribonucleases and transaminases. 
Chapter  3  focuses on the development of molecular reactors. The primary role of these 
containers is to increase the selectivity of a chemical transformation, which also may 
occur by decreasing the overall rate of the process. In chapter  4 , special cyclodextrin -
 mediated reactions are discussed. Since guest complexation offers the possibility of 
performing organic reactions in aqueous media, microsolvent effects are feasible, the

Preface
protection of water - sensitive intermediates is achieved, and conformational control during 
the reaction is realized. Indeed, this approach has great appeal for environmental chem-
istry. Chapter  5  demonstrates the potential of nanoreactor technology, using zeolites as 
an example. These inorganic inclusion compounds are widely used on an industrial scale 
during petroleum reﬁ ning, for example, because they catalyze the isomerization and 
oligomerization of alkenes. The utility of these materials is due to the presence of active 
sites in well - deﬁ ned cavities that enable customized control of reaction selectivity. And 
though these natural catalysts are readily available, easily reusable, and therefore cost -
 effective, the facile preparation of a container of sufﬁ cient size suitable for the regulation 
of a chemical reaction is an ongoing challenge. To fashion cages as appropriate nano -
 reactors, a novel approach avoiding tedious multistep synthesis is becoming widespread. 
It entails the self - assembly of noncovalent capsules. The results obtained using these 
organized media are highlighted in chapter  6 . 
 Another promising method to augment selectivity is described in chapter  7  and is based 
on the concept of concave reagents whose reactive moiety is situated inside a cleft or 
macrocycle and thereby sterically shielded. Another popular group of hosts used to control 
reactions are the calixarenes (chapter  8 ). Their appeal derives from the ease of the mac-
rocyclic ring - closure during their synthesis and the capability of performing selective 
derivatization to both increase the size of the cavity and introduce functional groups. 
Using this method, a cage can be built wherein the reacting guest is completely imprisoned 
and may only escape at elevated temperatures. These hosts, known as hemicarcerands, 
have allowed isolation and spectroscopic observation of traditionally ephemeral interme-
diates. Remarkable results are presented in chapter  9 . In chapter  10 , an overview is given 
regarding the generation and associated change in reactivity of highly reactive intermedi-
ates, like radicals, carbenes, and nitrenes, within cavitands. This exposition is further 
elaborated by a presentation of the actual developments in dye encapsulation where 
improvements in the photoproperties and chemical stability are especially prized (chapter 
 11 ) and by a description of research on organic cations (chapter  12 ). 
 The subsequent chapters concern methodologies that are not only inspired by biology 
and enzyme mimicry, but actually employ modiﬁ ed biopolymers to achieve catalysis. In 
the ﬁ rst approach, the goal is to improve the enantioselectivity of a classic organometallic 
catalyst through its incorporation into a host protein that generates a secondary coordina-
tion sphere environment responsible for a rise in selectivity. These artiﬁ cial metalloen-
zymes are showcased in chapter  13 . The second technique is summarized in chapter  14  
and details the generation of artiﬁ cial RNA enzymes that are able to catalyze various 
chemical reactions, including the Diels – Alder reaction. 
 Finally, the assembly of more complex systems requires that the exact supramolecular 
reaction site be known. For this purpose, micelles and liposomes are very attractive due 
to the sequestering of reagents, the possibility of conducting various reactions in a con-
ﬁ ned space, and the similarity with living cells. These particular organized media are 
examined in detail in chapter  15 , which describes the catalytic effect of micelles and 
supramolecular systems based on cyclophanes. In addition, the encapsulation process of 
vesicles and their catalytic effect on organic reactions is outlined in chapter  16 . And, 
ﬁ nally, chapter  17 previews efforts to assemble a semi - synthetic cell. 
 Many authors contributed chapters for this book, whose scope covers an expansive 
interdisciplinary area. We are profoundly grateful for their input and expertise. Indeed,

 1.1  Introduction 
 Molecular recognition through non - covalent interactions between two or more molecules 
has attracted much attention from a broad spectrum of chemists for a long period of time 
and has already found many applications in various areas of science and technology. The 
concept of molecular recognition was ﬁ rst developed for biomolecular systems such as 
enzyme, antibody and DNA, which can selectively bind the speciﬁ c target molecules 
through non - covalent weak interactions, including hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, 
dipole – dipole, charge – dipole and hydrophobic interactions. 1 – 3   Recent studies on artiﬁ cial 
host – guest systems have revealed that molecular recognition is the essential conceptual 
basis for supramolecular chemistry and nanotechnology. 4,5 
 Reaction control through complexation of substrate by supramolecular host is a rela-
tively new idea compared to the conventional approaches that involve simple collisional 
attack or coordination of substrate to metal. Multiple non - covalent interactions in supramo-
lecular assembly bind and locate a site - speciﬁ c substrate in the right position, orientation 
and conformation near the catalyst or active site, stabilize the high - energy transition state, 
and eventually make the reaction faster and more selective. Typical examples are found 
in enzymatic reactions, which proceed with high speciﬁ city and efﬁ ciency in aqueous 
solutions under mild conditions. These observations in natural systems have inspired

chemistry and bio - inspired materials science and technology. 6,7 
 Contrary to the thermal counterpart, photochemical reactions in supramolecular system 
have been less investigated and therefore of current interest. Photochemistry is a powerful 
tool in synthetic chemistry as a complementary method for achieving compounds that are 
difﬁ cult to obtain through thermal reactions due to high strain, low stability, and orbital 
symmetry reasons. Unlike thermal reactions, photoreactions deal with excited - state mol-
ecules that are usually short - lived but experience much lower energy barriers and exhibit 
high reactivities even at low temperatures. As a consequence of these features, the precise 
control of a photoreaction is more difﬁ cult to achieve than that of thermal one. This is 
one of the reasons why most asymmetric photoreactions result in only relatively low 
enantioselectivities. In this context, supramolecular approaches to the photochemical 
asymmetric synthesis enable the more precise control of the orientation and conformation 
of substrates and, as a result, the enantioselectivity of photoproducts, by utilizing the 
non - covalent interactions in both ground and excited states. 
 Supramolecular photochemistry is a relatively new interdisciplinary area of science and 
may be tracked back to the work in early 1980s, where the spectroscopic properties of 
ions were manipulated by crown ethers.  8 – 10 The rapid development of supramolecular 
chemistry in the last two decades accelerated the application of supramolecular systems 
to organic photochemistry  11,12   and more recently to asymmetric synthesis,  13,14 leading to 
a great number of publications on reaction control by molecular recognition. Consequently, 
not all of these areas will be covered, but the concentration will be rather on the repre-
sentative supramolecular photoreactions conducted primarily in solution. This will help 
idenitify the crucial concepts, strategies and conclusions as well as the major factors and 
mechanisms that govern the supramolecular photochemistry in different systems, and also 
provide the possible applications and future perspectives of this interesting area of 
supramolecular chemistry. 
 1.2  Photochemical Reactions Mediated by Macrocyclic Compounds 
 1.2.1  Supramolecular Photoreactions with Crown Ethers 
 Crown ethers, a family of cyclic oligomers of ethylene oxide, are artiﬁ cial macrocyclic 
hosts which have been synthesized and utilized since the early days of supramolecular 
chemistry. 15,16   Besides various metal ions that are complexed by crown ethers mainly 
through ion – dipole interaction, primary and secondary organic ammonium ions also form 
stable complexes with larger sized crown ethers through ion – dipole and hydrogen - bond-
ing interactions. Stoddart and co - workers used crown ethers that can simultaneously bind 
two organic ammonium guests to facilitate photodimerization. 17 As illustrated in Scheme 
 1.1 ,  trans - stilbene derivative  2  forms a doubly encircled, doubly threaded 2   :   2 complex 
with bis - p - phenylene - 34 - crown - 10  1  to give a centrosymmetric [4]pseudorotaxane in the 
solid state. In addition to the hydrogen - bonding interactions between  1  and  2 , the complex 
is also stabilized by   π – π stacking interactions between the two  trans - stilbene units with 
mean interplanar and centroid - centroid separations of 3.57 and 4.33    Å , respectively. The 
close arrangement of stilbenes accelerates the photodimerization upon irradiation to

exclusively give a single cyclobutane isomer  4  with a  syn – anti – syn  conformation, as 
conﬁ rmed by X - ray crystallographic analysis. A control experiment showed that no pho-
todimerization but only  trans - to - cis  isomerization took place in the absence of crown 
ether  1 . 
 The photochromic behavior of viologens is greatly affected upon complexion with 
crown ether. Viologens show photoinduced colour change in the absence of any additional 
reagents when dispersed in isotropic thin polymer ﬁ lms. 18   Irradiation of benzylviologen 
 5  (Scheme  1.2 ) incorporated in a polymer matrix caused a colour change from colourless 
to blue as a result of the reduction of  5  from dication to radical cation, which was reverted 
to dication within 2 h in the dark. Crown ether  1  forms a 1   :   1 complex with  5  and also 
with  6 in acetone with association constants of  ca. 200  M  − 1 . The charge - transfer (CT) 
interaction between viologen  5  or  6  and  1  led to the formation of yellow - coloured CT 
complex with a CT absorption band at 453   nm and 421   nm for  5  and  6 , respectively. The 
crown ether complexes of photoreduced viologens showed much accelerated bleaching 
rates than the corresponding free viologen radical cations. A similar phenomenon was 
observed also for  2  ⊂  1 complex in a polymer matrix. 
 1.2.2  Supramolecular Photoreactions with Calixarenes 
 Calix[ n ]arenes are a class of macrocycles that are normally made up of phenol units linked 
with methylene bridges and possess cavities of various sizes that can accommodate small 
organic molecules primarily driven by hydrophobic interactions. 
 Water soluble  p - sulfonatocalix[6]arene (SCA[6]) and [8]arene (SCA[8]) (Scheme  1.3 ) 
have dimensions of 15.9    ×  11.8  Å  and 20.4    ×  16.7  Å  at the upper rim and 6.5    ×  3.3  Å and

8.6  ×  5.9  Å  at the lower rim, respectively,  19,20   and provide suitable cavities for accom-
modating quaternary ammonium ions,  21,22   native amino acids,  23   and small neutral organic 
molecules.  24   Using SCA[6] and SCA[8]  25   as supramolecular hosts, Ramamurthy  et al. 
investigated the photochemistry of benzoin alkyl ethers  7a – c . 26 – 28 These SCAs formed 
the corresponding 1   :   1 complexes with  7a – c  in aqueous solution, and  7a  showed modest 
association constants of 137   M  − 1 and 386  M  − 1  with SCA[6] and SCA[8], respectively. 
Upon photolysis, these benzoin alkyl ethers underwent both the Norrish type I (  α -
 cleavage) and type II (  γ  - hydrogen abstraction) reactions to give photoproducts  8 – 12 
(Scheme  1.3 ). In the absence of SCAs, pinacol ether  9  was obtained as in 92% relative 
yield in aqueous solution at pH 7, along with deoxybenzoin  11  (8% relative yield), 
for which the   α - cleavage ( k  α   ≈  10 10  s  − 1 ) faster than the   γ - hydrogen abstraction ( k  γ   ≈  
10 9  s  − 1 ) is responsible. However, when the photoreaction was performed in the presence 
of SCA, product  11  became the major product. The relative yield of the type II products 
 11 and  12 depends critically on the cavity size of hosts and association constants. 
Photoirradiation of  7a  in the presence of an 8 - fold excess amount of SCA[8] or SCA[6] 
gave  11  and  12  in 96% or 70% combined yield, respectively. The dominant formation of 
type II products suggests that  7  adopts a conformation favourable for   γ - hydrogen absorp-
tion in the cavity. Choosing a suitable substrate with higher binding afﬁ nity for SCA is 
likely to be crucial in improving the stereoselectivity of photoreaction. 
 Photoreaction of stilbazoles  13a – f  (Scheme  1.4 ) has also been investigated in the pres-
ence of SCA[ n ]. Upon irradiation in dilute aqueous HCl solution without a host,  trans -
 stilbazoles  13a – f  gave predominantly  cis - isomers  16a – f , along with only small amounts 
of  anti - head - to - tail  (HT) dimers  14a – f  and  anti - head - to - head  (HH) dimers  15a – f . 29 In 
aqueous solution, stilbazoles were found to form 2   :   1 complexes with SCA[8] and SCA[6], 
irradiation of which afforded the corresponding  anti - HT dimer in 66 – 86% yield in the 
presence of SCA[8] and in 60 – 76% yield in the presence of SCA[6]. The  anti - HH dimer 
was given in only 16% yield, which was attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between 
two pyridinium components. The hydrophobic nature of SCA cavity should be responsi-
ble for the inclusion of stilbazoles. It is thus concluded that SCAs control the orientation 
of stilbazoles through complex formation to eventually enhance the distribution of 
HT dimer.

 Unlike water - soluble calixarenes that encapsulate guests by hydrophobic, electrostatic 
and van der Waals interactions, amphiphilic calixarenes in solid state form container -  or 
capsule - like structures and include guest molecules predominantly through van der Waals 
interactions. Photochemical behavior of stilbenes included in amphiphilic molecular cap-
sules of  p - hexanoylcalix[4]arene  19  (Scheme  1.5 ) in the solid state was studied by 
Ananchenko  et al. 30   Possessing diverse uni -  and bimolecular reaction routes, including 
geometrical isomerization, cyclization and cyclodimerization, stilbenes are good model 
compounds for examining the effects of calixarene capsules on photoreactivity. In the 
solid state, two molecules of  19 self - assemble in a head - to - head fashion to form a hydro-
phobic capsule, which can accommodate two  cis - stilbene molecules to give a 2  :  2 complex. 
This 2   :   2 complex is not very stable and can release one  cis - stilbene molecule. On the 
other hand,  trans - stilbene  20  is co - included with an ethanol molecule in the capsule to 
give a 1   :   1   :   2 complex. Irradiation of the complex of  cis - stilbene ﬁ rst gave rise to  trans -
 stilbene, and then to [2+2] dimers  21  and  22  in 5   :   1 ratio upon prolonged irradiation. 
Irradiation of  trans - stilbene complex gave  cis - and  trans - stilbene in 1  :  1 ratio, along with 
a trace amount of dimers  21  and  22 , conﬁ rming that the initial capsule is occupied pri-
marily by only one  trans - stilbene molecule. 
 Notably, calixarene  19  readily forms solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), which can serve 
as a potential carrier system.  31 2 - Ethylhexyl  trans - 4 - methoxycinnamate  23  can be loaded

[ 19 ]   =   0.6) with that of crystalline complex  23   ⊂  19 2  revealed that the complexation 
pattern of the SLN loaded with  23  is similar to that of the crystalline complex. No dimeri-
zation product was obtained upon irradiation of  23  loaded in SLN of  19 , and only pho-
toisomerization occurred to give a 4   :   6 mixture of  cis - and  trans - isomer. However, when 
the stoichiometry was changed to [ 23 ]/[ 19 ]  =  1.2, photolysis of  23  loaded in SLN yielded 
HH dimers  24  and  25  in a combined yield of  ca.  10%. This regioselectivity of cyclodimer-
ization of  23  is attributed to the fact that two  23  molecules preferably align in the  19 ’ s 
cavity in HH orientation. These results suggest that one can efﬁ ciently manipulate the 
photochemical behavior of  23  by simply adjusting the molar ratio of  23  loaded to the 
SLNs of amphiphilic  19 . 
 1.2.3  Supramolecular Photoreactions with Cyclodextrins 
 Cyclodextrins (CDs) are most frequently employed hosts for supramolecular photoreac-
tions by virtue of the fact that they are readily available, UV - transparent, water - soluble 
and capable of accommodating a wide range of organic guests in their hydrophobic cavi-
ties. Organic guests can form inclusion complexes with   α - ,   β - and   γ - CDs in various stoi-
chiometries both in solution and in the solid state. 
 Unimolecular Reactions    The cavity of   β  - CD is smaller than that of   γ - CD, and normally 
includes one organic molecule of suitable size to form 1  :  1, 2  :  2 or 2  :  1 host – guest com-
plexes. Asymmetric intramolecular  meta - photocycloaddition of phenoxyalkenes (Scheme 
 1.6 ) has been studied in the presence of   β - CD by Eycken and co - workers 32 . The inclusion 
complexes of  26 ,  28 ,  30 and  32 with  β - CD were collected from the deposit formed in a 
warm aqueous solution containing   β  - CD and substrates by centrifugation and decantation. 
For the complexes of  26a ,  28b ,  30a  and  30b  with   β - CD, the host - guest stoichiometries 
were determined as 2   :   1 by UV spectroscopy, while the rest of the substrates formed 1   :   1 
complexes. Irradiation of the solid complexes for 24 h led to  ca. 55 – 82% conversion, 
which are appreciably lower than that obtained in the solution - phase photoreactions. In 
all cases,  meta  - photocycloaddition led exclusively to only one regioisomer of 1,5 - bridged 
dihydrosemibullvalenes  27 ,  31  and  33  respectively from  26 ,  30  and  32 . On the contrary, 
irradiation of complex  28  ⊂    CD afforded two  meta  adducts  29a,b  and  29c,d . The regi-
oselectivity of adducts  29a and  29c is about 1  :  3 in the presence of   β - CD against 1  :  1 in 
the absence of   β - CD. Photocyclization of  ‘ linear ’  photosubstrates  26a,b  gave insigniﬁ cant 
enantiomeric excess (ee) of less than 3%, which is probably due to the less restricted 
orientation of  p - substituted substrate in the cavity. Photocyclization of  28a afforded minor 
product  29a  in much better 17% ee but the major product  29c  in only 2% ee. These results 
may indicate the trade - off relationship between chemical and optical yield: thus, larger 
steric hindrance leads to low chemical but high optical yield, and vice versa.   
 It is well documented that direct or sensitized photolysis of ( Z ) - cyclooctene  34Z leads 
to geometrical isomerization to planar chiral ( E ) - isomer  34E (Scheme  1.7 ). 33   Due to the 
comprehensive work by Inoue  et al. , the enantiodifferentiating photoisomerization of  34Z 
sensitized by optically active benzenecarboxylates has become a benchmark reaction for 
evaluating chiral photosensitizing system.  34 – 36 The ﬁ rst supramolecular enantiodifferenti-
ating photoisomerization of  34Z  was examined in direct photolysis of its   β - CD complex

in the solid state. Photoproduct obtained from this complex was almost racemic with only 
0.24% ee, demonstrating that the cavity interior of native   β  - CD does not possess sufﬁ cient 
enantiodifferentiating ability for the photoisomerization of  34Z . 
 A more sophisticated strategy for achieving higher levels of enantiodifferentiation has 
been established by performing the photolysis of  34Z  with sensitizing chiral hosts  35 
(Scheme  1.7 ), in which a chromophore is introduced to the primary rim of   β - CD. A clear 
merit of this supramolecular photosensitization system is that the energy of excited sen-
sitizer can be efﬁ ciently transferred to  34Z  included in CD cavity, while the undesirable, 
less - enantiodifferentiating sensitization outside the CD cavity can be prevented. 
Furthermore, this sensitizing host strategy allows the asymmetric photoreaction to 
occur with only a catalytic amount of chiral host, achieving photochemical chirality 
ampliﬁ cation. 
 In contrast to the small  E / Z  ratios around 0.25 reported for non - supramolecular 
photosensitizations by conventional alkyl benzoates,  37 an  E / Z  ratio of up to 0.8 were 
obtained at the photostationary state in 1   :   1 methanol – water mixture by using  35 . By 
adjusting the solvent composition, good enantiomeric excesses of up to 24% were 
obtained upon photosensitization with  35a – d . The enantioselectivity of  34E obtained 
in the photoisomerization of  34Z  with non - methylated CD is in general insensitive to 
the temperature variations as a result of the insigniﬁ cant role of entropy in the   β - 
CD - based supramolecular photochirogenesis system. However, the photoisomerization 
of  34Z  in permethylated CD derivatives  35e – h  turned out to be highly temperature 
dependent, frequently leading to a switching of the product chirality by changing the 
reaction temperature.  38 The more ﬂ exible skeleton of permethylated CD due to the lack 
of hydrogen - bonding net at the secondary rim is responsible for the temperature - depend-
ent enantioselectivity. 
 Recently, further efforts were done to elucidate the effects of chromophore substitution 
on the ee of  34E , 39   and much better enantiomeric excesses of up to 46% were reported 
upon photosensitized isomerization mediated by  35m . Analogous hosts  35a ,  35l  and  35n 
afforded only modest ee ’ s in a range of 4% – 10% under optimized conditions.  40 The ee 
value falls drastically to 1.7% when the  meta  - substituent is altered from methoxy ( 35m ) 
to methyl in  35j . This result reveals the critical dependence of the efﬁ ciency of chirality 
transfer on the sensitizer structure in the supramolecular photosensitized isomerization 
system. 
 Bimolecular Reactions    β  - CD is known to hinder the [2+2] photodimerization of stil-
benes through complexation within its cavity.  41   In contrast,   γ - CD can simultaneously 
include two stilbenes in its larger cavity in both solution and solid phase to signiﬁ cantly 
facilitate the [2+2] photodimerization reaction. 
 Wenz and co - workers examined the complexation and photochemical behavior of 
water - soluble stilbene  36g  with   γ - CD in aqueous solution. 41   γ - CD forms 1  :  2 host – guest 
complex with  36g  in buffer solution (pH 5.7) at 25    ° C with stepwise association constants 
of K 1  =  385  M  − 1  and K 2  =  2730  M  − 1 . Photoirradiation of this ternary complex gave 
cyclobutanes  cis - 37g  in 19% and  trans - 39g  in 79% relative yield. The association con-
stants of adducts  37g  and  39g  with   γ - CD were K  37g  ⊂ γ - CD  =  520  M  − 1  and K  39g  ⊂ γ - CD  =  18000  M  − 1 , 
respectively, revealing a great difference in stability between the isomeric complexes of 
[ 36g ] 2  ⊂  γ - CD.

 The inclusion complexes of  36a – f  with   γ  - CD were prepared by the co - crystallization 
method. 42   The host/guest ratio varies from 1   :   1.60 to 1   :   1.95, indicating that most of the 
guests formed 1  :  2 host – guest complexes. However, the  cis - isomer  41a gave only 1  :  1 
complex with   γ  - CD under the same condition. Photolysis of  36  ⊂   γ  - CD for 24 h gave 
 syn - dimers  37a – f  and  38a – f  in 59 - 79% relative yield. This observation is in sharp contrast 
to the results obtained in the solution - phase photolysis of  37g  mentioned above, and is 
attributed to the rate - limiting diffusion process prior to the reaction. The large distance 
and nonparallel orientation of the oleﬁ nic double bonds of the stilbenes in crystal lattices 
prohibit the dimerization of  anti - isomers. 
 Tamaki  et al.  reported that water - soluble anthracene derivatives, such as 2 - anthrace-
nesulfonate and 2 - anthracenecarboxylate, form 2   :   1 complexes with   γ - CD in aqueous 
solution. 43,44 The [4+4] photodimerization of 2 - anthracenecarboxylate (AC) accommo-
dated in   γ  - CD and its derivatives was investigated in detail.  45 Inoue and co - workers 
have recently reinvestigated the photodimerization of AC from the chiral point of view 
by using a variety of chiral hosts.   γ - CD forms very stable 1  :  2 host - guest complex with 
AC in aqueous buffer solution with association constants of K 1  =  160  M  − 1 and 
K 2  =  38500  M  − 1 . 46 
 Photolysis of AC gives four isomeric cyclodimers:  anti - and  syn - HT dimers  43  and  44 
and  anti - and  syn - HH dimers  45  and  46 , of which  44  and  45  are chiral (Scheme  1.9 ). 
Irradiation of   γ - CD complex of AC at 0  ° C gives the HT dimers  43  and  44  as major 
products in 88% combined yield and HH dimers  45  and  46  as minor products in 12% 
yield. HT dimer  44  is given in a moderate enantioselectivity of 37% ee, while poor enan-
tioselectivity of less than 5% ee is given for HH dimer  45 . 
 Further efforts to improve the HT/HH and enantioselectivity of the photoreaction were 
carried out by using modiﬁ ed   γ - CDs. Ikeda  et al.  reported that, by using dipyridinio -
 appended   γ - CDs  49a – d  (Scheme  1.10 ) as chiral hosts,  45  is given in enhanced ee of 13%, 
which is signiﬁ cantly higher than that obtained with native   γ - CD. 47

 γ - CD derivative  47  that tethered with a ﬂ exible dicationic sidearm on the primary rim 
was also employed for the purpose to improve the chemical and optical yield of HH 
dimers. 48   In aqueous solution, photoirradiation of AC with  47  gave the cyclodimers in 
relative yield and ee similar to those obtained with native   γ - CD. However, when the 
photoreaction was performed in a 1   :   1 mixture of water/methanol at  − 45  ° C, the chemical 
yield of HH dimers was dramatically enhanced to 72% with ee of  45  being signiﬁ cantly 
improved to 40%. The  anti / syn ( 45 / 46 ) ratio of HH dimers obtained in the photocy-
clodimerization of AC mediated by regioisomeric 6A,6X - diamino -  γ - CDs  48a – d gradually 
increased with increasing distance between the two ammonium groups, showing a nice 
structure – function relationship in supramolecular chirogenesis system.  49 Furthermore, a 
series of secondary - rim - substituted and skeleton - modiﬁ ed   γ - CDs  51 – 56  were synthesized 
in order to examine the effect of modiﬁ cation of CD skeleton on the photocyclodimeriza-
tion of AC.  50   The ee of HT dimer  44  was enhanced up to 71% and the combined yield of 
HT dimers reached 93% by the use of  54 at 210  MPa and  − 21.5  ° C. 
 Recently, the effects of ﬂ exible and rigid caps introduced to the primary rim of   γ - CD 
( 50a – d ,  57a – c ) on the photodimerization of AC were investigated, as capping is known 
to signiﬁ cantly modify the binding and reaction behavior of native CDs.  51,52 The chemical

yield and ee of HH dimer  45  were considerably improved by using capped   γ - CDs  57a – c . 
The enantioselectivity of HT dimer  44  was found to critically rely on the rigidity of the 
capping moiety. Thus, ﬂ exibly capped   γ - CD  50a  afforded  44  in moderate ee around 40%, 
whereas   γ - CD  57c that has a rigid biphenyl cap gave the antipodal  44 in 58% ee. 
 The main motif in the photocyclodimerization of AC mentioned above is to enhance 
the HT/HH and enantioselectivity through modiﬁ cation of   γ  - CD to provide an optimized 
microenvironment. An interesting approach has recently been explored to inﬂ uence the 
photoreaction inside a host by manipulating the moiety existing outside the cavity.  53 
Instead of directly using AC as substrate, 6 -  O - (2 - anthracenecarbonyl) -  α - CD  58 was 
employed as a photosubstrate that possesses a bulky   α  - CD to be located outside the host 
cavity upon complexation. Two anthracene moieties of  58  can be included in   γ - CD cavity 
to give the stepwise 1   :   1 and 1   :   2 association constants of 270 and 21700   M  − 1 , respectively. 
Photoirradiation of  58  yielded dimerization products  59 – 62  in the absence of host, which 
were hydrolyzed in alkaline solution to give  43 – 46  for evaluating the yield and enanti-
oselectivity. Direct irradiation of  58  gave HT dimers in 76% combined yield, with low 
ee ’ s for both HT dimer  44  (5% ee) and HH dimer  45  (16% ee). Photoirradiation of  58 in 
the presence of   γ - CD afforded   α - CD - stopped rotaxanes  63  and  64  in a high combined 
yield of 98%. Furthermore, the ee of HT dimer  44  was greatly enhanced to 91% under a 
pressure of 210   MPa at  − 20  ° C, suggesting that the   α  - CD that locates outside the   γ - CD

cavity can critically affect the stereo -  and enantioselectivity of the [4   +   4] photocy-
clodimerization of AC occurring inside the cavity. 
 1.2.4  Supramolecular Photoreactions with Cucurbiturils 
 Cucurbit[ n ]urils (CB[ n ]s) are a family of macrocyclic compounds comprising 5 – 10 gly-
coluril units. CB[6], CB[7] and CB[8] are similar in cavity volume to   α - CD,   β - CD and 
 γ  - CD, respectively. Differing from CDs, CBs are achiral host molecules of D nh symmetry 
and therefore cannot provide chiral microenvironment. 
 Although the solubility of CB[7] in water is the highest in the CB family, the relative 
small cavity, compared to that of CB[8], appears to have limited its application as a tem-
plate in photochemistry. Up to now, only one work on [4   +   4] photodimerization of a 
small cationic guest, i.e. protonated 2 - aminopyridine  65  (Scheme  1.12 ), by CB[7] in 
aqueous solution has been reported by Macartney and co - workers.  54 The [4  +  4] photo-
dimerization of  65  in acidic aqueous solution in the absence of CB[7] gave  anti - and 
 syn - trans - 4,8 - diamino - 3,7 - diazatricyclo[4.2.2.2] - dodeca - 3,7,9,11 - tetraenes  66 and  67 in 
4   :   1 ratio. CB[7] can form complex with  65 in 1  :  1 and 2  :  1 stoichiometries, depending 
on the amount of  65  added. Irradiation of 2   :   1 complex showed a greatly improved reac-
tion rate and gave exclusively  anti - trans - 66  in 90% yield without accompanying any other 
products. Such a high stereoselectivity suggests that two  65  molecules in an  anti - trans 
alignment are stabilized in CB[7] cavity. Interestingly, the inclusion of photoproduct  66 
in the CB[7] cavity efﬁ ciently prohibits its thermal re - aromatization. 
 Kim  et al.  reported that CB[8] could accommodate two aromatic guest molecules to 
form 1  :  2 host - guest complexes or 1  :  1  :  1 ternary complexes. The solubility of CB[8] is 
quite poor in water and organic solvents. Fortunately, by adding some metal cations, the 
solubility of CB[8] could be considerably increased in water. This observation enabled 
scientists to investigate intermolecular photoreactions in CB[8] cavity. 
 Stilbene and its derivatives, which had been widely investigated in CDs and CAs, can 
be included in CB[8] cavity to form 2   :   1 complexes.  55 Two ( E ) - diaminostilbene dihydro-
chloride  68  (Scheme  1.13 ) can insert into CB[8] cavity to give a 2   :   1 host - guest complex 
which has a good solubility in water. Photoirradiation of the complex gave [2+2] photo-
dimerization product 1  α ,2 α ,3 β ,4 β - tetrakis(4 - aminophenyl)cyclobutane  69  as major 
product, along with a trace amount of 1  α ,2 β ,3 α ,4 β - tetrakis(4 - aminophenyl)cyclobutane 
 70 . No formation of the isomerization product ( Z ) - 68  was observed, which is signiﬁ cantly 
different from the photoreaction of ( E ) - 68  in the absence of CB[8]. The stereoselectivity 
of photodimerization in the presence of CB[8] ( syn / anti    =   95/5) is much better than that 
obtained with  γ - CD ( syn / anti  =  80/20).

 Irradiation of  trans - 1,2 - bis(4 - pyridyl)ethylene dihydrochloride in the presence of 
CB[8] also yields the  syn  - dimer as major product in 90% relative yield and  anti - dimer in 
only 4% relative yield.  56   However, in the presence of CB[7], no [2+2] dimerization 
product was obtained and only  cis - 1,2 - bis(4 - pyridyl)ethylene was formed. This result is 
attributed to the different complexation stoichiometry of 1,2 - bis(4 - pyridyl)ethylene with 
CB[7] (1  :  1) and CB[8] (2  :  1). 
 Recently, photodimerization of unsymmetrical bispyridylethylenes  71  was investigated 
in the cavity of CB[8].  57   Irradiation of  71  in the absence of CB[8] gave no [2+2] photo-
dimer, and only  trans - to - cis  isomerization is observed for the photoreaction in the pres-
ence of CB[7]. Interestingly, irradiation of  71  with CB[8] gave exclusively  anti - HT  74 
and  syn - HH  72  dimers in 80% and 15% relative yield, respectively, among four possible 
[2+2] dimers of  syn - HH  72 ,  syn - HT  73 ,  anti - HT  74 and  anti - HH  75 . 
 Wu  et al.  investigated the photodimerization of alkyl 2 - naphthoates  76a,b (Scheme 
 1.14 ) in the presence of CB[8].  58   The solubility of  76a,b  in water was enhanced upon 
addition of CB[8]. As a result of 1   :   2 host – guest complexation between CB[8] and  76 , 
photodimerization reaction rate was greatly accelerated in aqueous solution to give 
cubane - like photodimers  77a,b . 
 Inoue and co - workers also examined the [4+4] photocyclodimerization of   α - CD 
appended anthracene derivative  58  mediated by CB[8] (Scheme  1.11 ).  58 Photodimerization

of AC using CB[8] as template gave photodimers in relative yields similar to those 
obtained in the absence of CB[8]. However, the use of CB[8] as a host for the photo-
dimerization of  58  totally inverted the selectivity observed with   γ  - CD to give HH dimers 
 45  and  46  in 99% combined yield. The steric repulsion between two   α - CD does not appear 
to play an important role in the determination of the HH/HT ratio but signiﬁ cantly affects 
the  anti / syn  ratio of HH dimers, revealing a dual role of the bulky   α - CD in the stereodif-
ferentiation step of the supramolecular photodimerization. On the other hand,   α - CD 
located outside the cavity could even transfer its chiral information to the photodimeriza-
tion occurring within the achiral cavity of CB[8] to yield  44  and  45  in modest 17% and 
10% ee, respectively. 
 Large - sized host molecules derived from calixarene and cyclotriveratrylenes have been 
reported recently. Gibb and co - workers reported some nanoscale host molecules based 
on resorcinarenes and studied their shape complementarities and the complexation behav-
ior with guest molecules.  59 – 61 Host  78  (Scheme  1.15 ), which provides a well - deﬁ ned 
hydrophobic environment in water, forms a capsular complex [ 78 ] 2  with a cavity dimen-
sion of 1   nm wide and 2   nm long.  59 Ramamurthy  et al.  examined the cage effect of host 
[ 78 ] 2 on the photoreaction of 1 - phenyl - 3 - p - tolyl - 2 - propanone, 62 which exhibit signiﬁ cant 
cage effect comparable to that reported in the solid state. 63,64 
 This host molecule can also form 2   :   2 complex with anthracene (Scheme  1.15 )  65 . 
However, no anthracene dimer was observed even after 10 h irradiation of the complex.

Steady - state ﬂ uorescence spectrum of anthracene without  78  was completely different 
from that in the presence of  78 . Thus, anthracene in aqueous solution showed only 
monomer ﬂ uorescence at 425   nm, but the complex with [ 78 ] 2  exhibited excimer emission 
of anthracene with a maximum at 510   nm and a long lifetime of 263   ns. This suggests that 
the capsule [ 78 ] 2 conﬁ nes two anthracene molecules in its cavity in staggered orientation. 
 Similar to anthracene, acenaphthylene can also be encapsulated by [ 78 ] 2 to form a 2  :  2 
complex. 66   NMR studies suggested that two acenaphthylene molecules are located in the 
middle of the capsule cavity and oriented in a parallel fashion. Irradiation of acenaphth-
ylene in the absence of any host yielded  syn - and  anti  - dimers, with the latter being the 
major product. Within the [ 78 ] 2  cavity, only  syn - dimer  79  was obtained upon irradiation. 
In the presence of triplet sensitizer eosin - Y, irradiation of the complex gave  syn - and 
 anti - dimers in a ratio 60  :  40. 
 Oleﬁ ns were also examined as guest substrates for this nanocapsule. 67   In borate buffer 
solution,  trans - and  cis - 4,4 ′ - dimethylstilbene  81a formed 1  :  2 complex with [ 78 ] 2 . 
Irradiation of  trans - 81a  ⊂  [ 78 ] 2  led to very slow isomerization, while  cis - 81a  ⊂  [ 78 ] 2 
converted to  trans  - isomer very fast. For stilbene  81b  with a smaller size, the  trans - to - cis 
isomerization became much easier and was almost unaffected by the capsule. Furthermore, 
4 - methylstyrene  83 , which has a half size of  81a , was irradiated in the capsule to explore 
its photochemical behavior. 4 - Methylstyrene  83 forms 2  :  2 complex with  78 . Irradiation 
of this complex afforded  84 and  85 in 45% and 55% relative yield, respectively. 
 1.3  Photochemical Reactions with Biomolecules 
 Biomolecules, such as protein, antibody and DNA, are macromolecules that possess 
binding sites for organic guests with well - deﬁ ned three - dimensional geometries and pre-
cisely arranged functional groups. As a result of their structural properties, biomolecules 
are characterized by the signiﬁ cant speciﬁ city for complexing and catalyzing their sub-
strates. For example, it is well known that enzyme can accelerate the reaction of its 
substrate by a factor of one million or even more compared to the control reaction in the 
absence of enzyme. Their binding sites are highly speciﬁ c to substrates and can usually 
catalyze a set of closely related substrates or reactions, but are silent to those mismatched. 
Since most biomolecules are water - soluble and heat - sensitive, performing a reaction with 
biomolecules deﬁ nitely means the use of mild and environmentally benign conditions. 
On the other hand, light energy is known to be environmentally benign and can be efﬁ -
ciently converted into chemical energy through biophotochemical process, such as pho-
tosynthesis. These properties are superior in many aspects to those of artiﬁ cial hosts and 
have attracted chemists to pursue efﬁ cient and selective chemical reactions in binding 
sites of biomolecules. 
 1.3.1  Photochemical Reactions Templated by Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) 
 DNAs are important molecules that carry the genetic information and are capable of self -
 replication in living organism. The basic unit of DNA is nucleotide that comprises of a 
nucleobase (adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine), deoxyribose, and a phosphate tail 
(Scheme  1.16 ). The precise complementarity between adenine and thymine and between 
cytosine and guanine renders two long chains of nucleotides coiled to give rise to a twisted

double helix, which is driven predominantly by hydrogen bonding and   π  π stacking 
interactions. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that the DNA chain itself can serve 
as a good template for precisely positioning the substrates linked to it. 
 Photoaddition of substrates covalently - linked to DNA at its terminus has been studied 
for the purpose of exploring photoinduced ligation of oligonucleotides. Photoligation has 
evident advantages that the ligation can be conducted in water without adding any external 
reagent in a non - enzymatic fashion and the original DNA can be recovered by wave-
length - selective irradiation. 
 Saito and co - workers investigated a series of photoligation reactions of DNA using 
native and terminus - functionalized oligonucleotides.  68 – 76   As illustrated in Scheme  1.17 , 
synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides  88a  and  88b , which bear a cytosine at the 3 ′ - end and a 
5 - vinyldeoxyuridine at the 5 ″ - end, are complementary to an oligodeoxynucleotide tem-

plate  89 . 68 In the absence of  89 , no photoadduct was given upon photoirradiation at 
366   nm, at which  88b  has only weak absorption of   ε 366  =  3.3. However, photoligated 
oligodeoxynucleotide  90  was obtained in up to 96% yield when photolysis was carried 
out for 12 h in the presence of  89 . Only one [2+2] photoadduct that has a  cis - syn stere-
ochemistry was afforded. The signiﬁ cantly enhanced reactivity and selectivity are attrib-
uted to the well - arranged orientation of two oligodeoxynucleotides when complexed with 
the template  89 . Vinyldeoxyuridine introduced at the 5 ′  - end underwent the same [2+2] 
photoaddition with thymine at the 3 ″  - end but not with adenine and guanine. The ligated 
oligodeoxynucleotide can be photodecomposed to give the original 6 - mers upon irradia-
tion at 302   nm but better recovered by further irradiation at 366   nm, suggesting photo-
chemical reversibility of the ligation process.   
 However, the split of ligated DNA with light at 302   nm may also result in damage to 
DNA due to the dimerization of thymine. To avoid this disadvantage, Fujimoto and co -
 workers synthesized 3 ″ - terminus - modiﬁ ed oligodeoxynucleotide  91 (Scheme  1.17 ), in 
which carbazole is tethered to the 5 - carboxyvinyluracil moiety as a sensitizer for photo-
decomposition.  69   Photolysis of oligodeoxynucleotides with a template gave ligated oligo-
deoxynucleotide with an efﬁ ciency order  91c  >  91b  >  91a . A  cis - syn  [2+2] adduct was 
given in 89% yield after the photolysis of  91c  at 366   nm for 6 h at room temperature in 
the presence of the template. The same reaction performed at 70    ° C, where  91c was 
decomplexed from the template, afforded no photoligated product, indicative of the 
importance of preorientation of photosubstrate by supramolecular host. On the other hand, 
photoirradiation of the isolated adduct in the absence of the template at 366   nm for 6 h 
afforded  91c in 90% yield as a result of the photosensitized split. 
 In order to improve the photoreactivity of template - directed photochemical synthesis 
of branched oligodeoxynucleotides, the 5 - vinyldeoxyuridine component was replaced by 
5 - carboxyvinyldeoxyuridine  92 , which has a much higher extinction coefﬁ cient 
( ε 366  =  76). 70   Photoirradiation of  92  for 1 h in the presence of a template gave a  cis - syn 
[2+2] adduct in good yield of 93%. Similar [2+2] photocycloaddition between an   α - 5 -
 cyanovinyldeoxyuridine  93  at the 3 ′  - end and a thymine at the 5 ′ - end also occurred 
smoothly in the presence of a template.  71   A single mismatch in oligodeoxynucleotide 
chain led to a great decrease of reaction rate, indicating a critical dependence of photoli-
gation on sequence speciﬁ city. 
 Using  94  as a template DNA, Ihara  et al.  investigated the photodimerization of anthra-
cene tethered to complementary oligodeoxynucleotides  95  and  96 (Scheme  1.18 ). 77 The 
reactivity of the photodimerization mediated by  94  was found to be dependent on the 
distance between oligodeoxynucleotides and anthracene, and decrease in an order of 
 95a / 96a  >  95a / 95b  >  95b / 96b  >  96a / 96b . The reaction efﬁ ciency is also signiﬁ cantly 
affected by the introduction of an additional or mismatched nucleotide, indicating that 
this DNA - templated photoligation is highly position - and distance - dependent. 
 Photodimerization of 1 - substituted anthracene derivatives  97a  and  97b (Scheme  1.19 ) 
templated by a full - match DNA  98 selectively afforded only two isomeric dimers among 
the eight dimers that are possibly formed from the dimerization of  97a  and  97b . 
Photoreaction with the full - match template was found to be much more efﬁ cient than 
those with mismatch templates. 78,79

and chiral in nature, they can be used as ideal stereodifferentiating binding sites. Inoue 
 et al.  performed the enantiodifferentiating photoisomerization of  34Z (Scheme  1.7 ) com-
plexed and sensitized by calf thymus DNA (ctDNA).  80   Photosensitized isomerization of 
 34Z  with pyrimidine nucleosides as chiral sensitizers afforded  34E  in 5.2% ee at the 
photostationary state. However, much better ee of up to 15.2% was obtained when the 
photolysis was carried out in the presence of ctDNA in aqueous solution. Supramolecular 
interaction of  34Z  with hydrophobic minor groove of ctDNA evidently plays an important 
role in the photochirogenesis, as only negligible ee was obtained for  34E  when the pho-
tosensitization was performed in 50% aqueous methanol, in which the supramolecular 
interaction of  34E with ctDNA was signiﬁ cantly reduced.

 covalent interactions, such as ionic, hydrogen binding, van der Waals and hydrophobic 
interaction, these biopolymers fold into speciﬁ c conformations to achieve various biologi-
cal functions. The binding sites of deﬁ ned shape and size, as well as the chiral nature, 
render proteins excellent supramolecular hosts for speciﬁ c binding and recognition. A 
series of photochemical reactions have been investigated with various proteins, mainly 
targeting the photochemical chiral discrimination and generation based on the inherently 
chiral character of binding sites in protein. Serum albumin is the most abundant protein 
in plasma which binds and transports not only endogenous but also exogenous com-
pounds, and has therefore been most frequently employed as biosupramolecular host for 
photochemical reactions. 
 McDonagh and co - workers investigated the photoisomerization of bilirubin - IIIa  99a,b 
(Scheme  1.20 ) in the presence of human serum albumin (HSA). The  E - Z photoisomeriza-
tion between ( Z , Z ) - 99a  and ( E , Z ) - 99b  is not inhibited even in the binding cavity of HSA. 
Bilirubin - IIIa shows intense bisignate circular dichroism spectra in the chiral pocket of 
HSA. 81,82   The negative exciton coupling signal, which was observed upon irradiation of 
( Z , Z ) - bilirubin - IIIa/HSA complex with a broad - band blue light of   λ max  =  430  nm, was 
dramatically switched to a positive exciton coupling signal after irradiation with green 
light at 544  nm. 83   This signal switching, which is controllable by changing the irradiation 
wavelength, renders the system a potential chiroptical switch.   
 Zandomeneghi  et al.  reported the enantioselective photoinduced decomposition of 
1,1 ′ - binaphthol  100  (Scheme  1.21 ) included in bovine serum albumin (BSA). 
Complexation of ( R ) - (+) - and ( S ) - ( – ) - 100 with BSA revealed a remarkable difference 
in stability between the two diastereomeric complexes, and the BSA complex of ( S ) -
 ( – ) - 100  exhibited a signiﬁ cantly bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum. By 
selectively irradiating the ( S ) - ( – ) - 100  complex at longer wavelengths, ( R ) - (+) - 100 of 
up to 99.5% ee was obtained after 77% of the starting material (racemic  100 ) were 
decomposed. 84 – 86 
 Miranda  et al.  studied the excited - state behavior of chiral drugs bound to BSA and 
HSA. 87 – 89   Inclusion of carprofen  101  (Scheme  1.22 ) in HSA signiﬁ cantly lengthened the 
triplet - state lifetime of  101  as a result of more rigid surroundings and the suppression of 
self - quenching of  101 . The complexation of enantiomeric  101  with HSA caused a sig-
niﬁ cant difference in triplet lifetime, and the lifetime of ( S ) - 101  - HSA complex is 4 times 
shorter than that of ( R ) - 101  - HSA complex. Irradiation of  101  alone in aqueous buffer 
solution led to a polymerization of  101 . However, dechlorinated carprofen  102 was

in producing the corresponding ( S ) - and ( R ) - 102 . 
 The complexation behavior of organic substrates with proteins is usually very compli-
cated as a consequence of the diversiﬁ ed binding sites with distinctive size, shape, hydro-
phobicity and binding afﬁ nity. Since these binding sites differ in reactivity and selectivity, 
elucidation of binding behaviour is essential for understanding and manipulating the 
photoreaction performed in the binding sites of proteins. Inoue and co - workers have 
comprehensively studied the binding behaviour of 2 - anthracenecarboxylate (AC) (Scheme 
 1.9 ) to the hydrophobic pockets of BSA and HSA by a combined use of spectroscopic 
techniques, i.e. UV/Vis, ﬂ uorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy.  90 – 92 Although 
HSA and BSA share more than 95% of amino acid residues in common (i.e., 26 out of 
 ca.  600 amino acids), the two albumins display entirely different binding, photophysical 
and photochemical behavior. BSA possesses four binding sites, which accommodate 1, 
3, 2 and 3 AC molecules with individual binding constants of 5.3    ×  10 7 ,1.3  ×  10 5 , 1.4  ×  10 4 
and 3    ×  10 3  M  − 1 , respectively. In contrast, HSA provides ﬁ ve binding sites that accom-
modate 1, 1, 3, 5 and  > 10 AC molecules in the order of reducing binding ability.  93 – 97 
Although multiple AC molecules are bound to sites 2 – 4 of BSA and sites 3 – 5 of HSA, 
they do not appear to be very closely located to each other, since no exciton coupling 
was seen in the circular dichroism spectrum and no static quenching of ﬂ uorescence was 
detected. AC bound to site 1 of BSA shows highly structured ﬂ uorescence with dual 
lifetimes of 4.8 and 2.1   ns, which are assignable to two kinds of AC that differ in position 
or orientation in highly hydrophobic environment. However, ACs in site 2 of BSA gave 
a much longer lifetime of 13.3   ns and the ﬂ uorescence spectra became broader; the life-
times of AC in sites 3 and 4 are practically indistinguishable from that in bulk water 
(15.9   ns). Almost the same is true for HSA, except for the fact that not only the ﬁ rst but 
also the second site bind only one AC and are highly hydrophobic.

 Each binding site in BSA and HSA exhibits very different photochemical behaviour. 
Thus, the HT/HH ratio and enantioselectivity obtained in albumin - mediated AC photo-
cyclodimerization are dynamic functions of the AC/BSA or AC/HSA ratio. For example, 
the HT dimers are produced as the major products in the photodimerization of AC in 
host - free bulk water and also in the presence of HSA, whereas the HH dimers become 
the dominant products in the BSA - mediated photodimerization. In the presence of BSA 
(AC/BSA  =  1.3), chiral HT and HH dimers,  44  and  45 , were obtained in 29% and 41% 
ee, respectively. Interestingly, the ee ’ s for  44  and  45  were further improved up to 38% 
and 58% by adding nitromethane as a site - selective quencher of AC located in such 
binding sites that are more accessible but less enantioselective. 
 In the case of HSA, much higher 79% and 88% ee were reported for  44  and  45 , respec-
tively, at 25    ° C and AC/HSA   =   3. Temperature was found to have a modest effect on the 
enantioselectivity to give better ee ’ s of 82% and 90% for  44  and  45 , respectively, by 
decreasing the temperature to 5  ° C.

 Besides the natural and artiﬁ cial molecular hosts that are primarily based on organic 
compounds, photochemical reactions have also been investigated in the conﬁ ned spaces 
of inorganic nano -  or mesoarchitecture. Zeolites, which are porous crystalline alumino-
silicates composed of tetrahedral AlO 4  and SiO 4  building blocks and usually possess 
cages and channels of 4 – 14  Å , have been extensively used as hosts for mediating photo-
chemical reactions. The ratio of SiO 4 to AlO 4  can be changed from 1 to inﬁ nite, and metal 
cations are commonly introduced to balance the negative charge of AlO 4  units. The fau-
jasite and pentasil family of zeolites, which form roughly spherical supercages of  ca. 13  Å 
and tubular channels with lengths of  ca. 50  Å , are most commonly used zeolites for cata-
lyzing chemical reactions. Zeolites have a wide UV/Vis transparent region as a result of 
Al – O – Si framework that is similar to glass and quartz, and therefore are compatible with 
most organic compounds. The size and free volume zeolite supercages are adjustable by 
the number and sort of countercations. By virtue of these properties, zeolites have attracted 
much attention of photochemist as conﬁ ning media in the last two decades.

Molecular Encapsulation
 Studies on photochemical reactions within zeolites have already been summarized in 
several reviews.  98 – 102   The earliest work in this ﬁ eld appeared in 1980s.  103 – 106 Turro and 
co - workers investigated Norrish type I and type II photoreactions of phenyl alkyl ketones 
 103  in the supercage of faujasite - type zeolites. Photolysis of  103  in solution or solid state 
was known to give a variety of photoproducts  104 – 108 , depending on the molecular 
mobility, conformation and orbital overlap in the excited state. Inclusion of  103  in zeolites 
can signiﬁ cantly modify the above factors and lead to a switching of reaction selectivity. 
Photolysis of  103  in supercages of NaY zeolite gave a mixture of products with modest 
selectivities;  105 /( 107  +  108 )  =  0.72 – 0.83. The ratio was improved to 3.2 – 3.8 by using 
NaX zeolite, and was dramatically enhanced up to  > 50 by using silicalite (S - 115) zeolite,  105 
suggesting that this photoreaction is highly dependent on the cavity size of zeolite. 
 Photooxygenation of ( Z ) - enecarbamate  109  (Scheme  1.24 ) in solution gave methyl 
deoxybenzoin  112  in only a modest enantioselectivity even at a very low temperature, 
while a much better optical yield was obtained by starting from the ( E ) - isomer  110 . 107 – 111 
The conﬁ nement in zeolite supercage greatly restricts the orientation and conformation 
of photosubstrate and leads to a signiﬁ cant switching of reaction selectivity from that 
observed in isotropic media. Thus, singlet oxygenation of ( Z ) - 109  in NaY zeolite loaded 
with cationic dye sensitizer methylene blue (which is readily introduced into zeolite 
supercage through cation exchange and generates  1 O 2  from  3 O 2  upon irradiation) gave 
 112  in up to 80% ee. This is possibly due to the restricted space of zeolite supercage that 
aligns the substrate in an orientation suitable for   π - face - selective attack of the C = C bond 
by  1 O 2 . Compared to the high ee obtained in methylene - blue - exchanged NaY, the same 
reaction performed in LiY zeolite gave  112  in only 35% ee, for which the larger available 
volume in the supercage of LiY zeolite is possibly responsible. 
 Besides the well - conﬁ ned and rigid framework of zeolites, cation species also plays an 
important role in manipulating photochemical reaction occurring in the cavity.  112 – 121 The 
free volume in zeolite cavity relies on the number and sort of cations located in the cavity. 
Differing from isotropic media, in which the direction and magnitude of electric ﬁ eld 
ﬂ uctuate around a solvated molecule, cations in zeolite cavity generate a stronger, aniso-
tropic and more stable electric ﬁ eld. Such an electric ﬁ eld can polarize the included

molecules, distort their electron density, and even facilitate heterolytic bond cleavage. 
Indeed, it has been observed that the intensity and wavelength of absorption and emission 
of included aromatic compounds were signiﬁ cantly changed in the cavity of zeolite.  122 – 125 
Ramamurthy  et al.  reported that photoreaction of dibenzobarrelene  113 (Scheme  1.25 ) in 
Li + and Na +  exchanged zeolites resulted in triplet photoproduct  115  in 67% and 62% 
yield, respectively. This observation indicates that the intersystem crossing is signiﬁ cantly 
accelerated even by light atoms. However, this effect disappeared when the zeolites were 
equilibrated with water before use. The electric ﬁ eld of the cations in the cavity, which 
perturbs the symmetric nature of photosubstrate and facilitates the intersystem crossing, 
may be responsible for this  ‘ light atom ’  effect. On the other hand, the heavy atom effect 
is clearly seen even for hydrated cations, and  > 99% triplet photoproduct was observed 
with Tl + - incorporated zeolite. 126 – 129 
 Photoreactivity of androstenedione  116  (Scheme  1.26 ) was demonstrated to be dramati-
cally affected by the electric ﬁ eld of zeolite.  130   The epimerization of  116  to yield  117 is 
the major reaction in isotropic solution such as hexane, methylene chloride, methanol and 
cyclohexane. The reduction of the cyclohexenone A - ring can be observed in only propa-
nol, with  118  and  119  being given in 14% combined yield. However, irradiation of  116 
in NaY afforded exclusively the reduction products in  > 85% yield, and no product due 
to the reaction at the D - ring was observed. This reactivity change observed for the andros-
tenedione included in zeolite cavity was ascribed to the lowering of the   π , π  *   excited state 
of the A - ring due to the electric ﬁ eld in zeolite cavity. 
 Interactions between cation and photosubstrate, such as cation – π , cation – dipole and 
cation – lone pair interactions, may restrict the mobility and conformation of photosub-
strate, and therefore endow the cation with versatile roles in manipulating the reactivity 
and selectivity of photoreaction in zeolite cavity.  131 – 142 Ramamurthy and co - workers have 
studied stereoselective photoisomerization of diphenylcyclopropane derivatives in zeolite 
supercage. It was found that the photoisomerization of  trans - diphenylcyclopropane  121a 
occurred in the cavity of alkali cation - exchanged Y zeolite to give  cis - 120a  in high

efﬁ ciency, while the photolysis of  cis - 120a  failed to give any  trans - isomer. 134 This is 
ascribed to the formation of cation – π  complex in which two phenyl groups of  cis - 121a 
sandwich an alkali metal ion. The  cis  - isomer is thus stabilized and the isomerization 
reaction is inhibited. 
 However,  trans - isomers can be given upon photoirradiation of zeolite - mediated  cis -
 diphenylcyclopropane derivatives  120b – e due to the stronger cation – dipole interaction 
between cation and carboxamide group than cation – π  interaction. Photolysis of amide 
 120b – e in hexane - methylene chloride solution afforded the corresponding  trans - isomers 
in diastereomeric excess (de) less than 2%. In sharp contrast to the result obtained in 
isotropic solution, photoreaction of  120b – e  adsorbed in zeolite MY gave  trans - isomers 
in 20 – 83% de. The dramatic improvement of de is believed to occur as a result of cation –
 carbonyl and cation – nitrogen dipolar interactions that ﬁ x the conformation of reactants, 
with asymmetric centres of the chiral amide moiety being located closer to the chirogenic 
center. 114,132,134,138,143 
 Chiral photochemistry in zeolite is an intriguing topic that has attracted intensive atten-
tion. Although theoretically zeolites can be chiral, until now no chiral zeolite has been 
separated in an enantiomerically pure form. Chiral photochemistry in zeolite is conducted 
primarily through two strategies: the ﬁ rst one is to introduce a chiral auxiliary to photo-
substrate and the diastereodifferentiating photoreaction is conducted in intact zeolite, as 
exempliﬁ ed in the diastereoselective photoisomerization of diphenylcyclopropane deriva-
tives mentioned above, and the second one is to immobilize optically active compound 
to chirally modify the zeolite supercage and the enantiodifferentiating photoreaction of 
prochiral substrate is conducted in this chiral supercage. 
 Zeolites modiﬁ ed with norephedrine, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as chiral induc-
tors have been employed for the enantioselective photocyclization of a series of tropolone 
derivatives  122 . 113,144,145   Photocyclization of  122b  conducted in NaY zeolite modiﬁ ed with 
( – ) - ephedrine gave  123b  in up to 78% ee. The enantioselectivity of the photoreaction was 
found to be critically controlled by the cationic species and water content in zeolites. 
 The optical yield of photoreaction in chirally modiﬁ ed zeolite relies on several factors 
such as cation, chiral inductor and its loading level, which is usually kept at a high level 
to maximize the number of chiral inductors located around the photosubstrate. An excep-
tional example may be found in the enantiodifferentiating photoisomerization of  34Z 
(Scheme  1.7 ) sensitized by optically active (poly)alkyl benzoate derivatives immobilized

in NaY zeolite reported by Inoue and co - workers.  146   The photoreaction was allowed to 
occur in the presence of a catalytic amount of sensitizer, and  34E  was obtained in a modest 
ee of 4.5% upon photosensitization with ( – ) - methylheptyl benzoate - immobilized NaY 
zeolite. In contrast, the same sensitizer gave racemic  34E in homogenous solution. 
 1.4.2  Photochemical Reactions in Mesoporous Materials 
 Mesoporous materials have recently attracted considerable attention for the use in pho-
tochemical reactions. As deﬁ ned by the IUPAC nomenclature rules, mesoporous materials 
have a pore diameter in the range of 2.0 – 50.0   nm, which is much larger in general than 
that of zeolite and is certainly beyond the size of normal organic substrates. Therefore, 
photoreactions can freely proceed without suffering any restriction. In fact, studies on 
photochemical reaction in mesoporous materials focus more on construction of functional 
materials rather than the chemical selectivity. For example, azobenzene, which is structur-
ally rigid and has a van der Waals volume of 144    Å 3 , 147   requires a large extra volume of 
127  Å 3  for the photoisomerization to occur. Taking advantage of this property, azobenzene 
was loaded into nanocomposite ﬁ lms to be used for and showed a potential application 
in adjusting the cavity volume of mesoporous materials.  148 Mal  et al.  constructed a pho-
tochemically controlled system by anchoring coumarin to the pore openings of MCM - 41 
for taking up or releasing organic guests by controlling the reversible photodimerization 
of coumarin. 149 
 The size of mesoporous silica MCM - 41 can be adjusted by changing the number of 
carbon atoms in surfactant micelles used in the hydrothermal synthesis. Iwamoto and 
co - workers have reported photocyclization of diarylethenes  124 in different - sized MCM -
 41. Only the anti - parallel conformation of open form  124  can undergo cyclization upon 
irradiation to give closed form  125 . The reaction rate of  124  was found to be remarkably 
dependent on the amount of  124  loaded as well as the pore diameter of MCM - 41s, but 
be independent of the organic groups on the surface of MCM - 41s. 150 
 Recently, Inoue and co - workers studied the enantiodifferentiating photocyclodimeriza-
tion of AC in the channel of mesoporous silica that is modiﬁ ed with   γ - CD. 151 
Photocyclodimerization of AC with mesoporous without   γ - CD gave HH photodimers

with a low conversion and enantioselectivity. In remarkable contrast to the   γ - CD - mediated 
photoreaction performed in aqueous solution, the photocyclodimerization of AC in   γ - 
CD - modiﬁ ed mesoporous silica led to the major formation of HH photodimers, in par-
ticular  anti - HH dimer  45 in 45% yield and 24.1% ee. 
 1.4.3  Photochemical Reaction with Self - Assembled Molecular Cages 
 Organic ligands bearing two or more coordinating sites can form well - structured aggre-
gates upon coordination to metals. Some of these ligand – metal self - assemblies form 
structurally well - conﬁ ned cavity that can accommodate organic guests of suitable size. 
These cages generally have polyhedron structure with rigid skeleton, and the motion of 
guest(s) included in the cavity is greatly inhibited. Thermal and photochemical reactions 
conducted in these molecular cages often show remarkably accelerated rates and signiﬁ -
cantly high selectivities. 152,153 
 Compounds  126  and  127  shown in Scheme  1.30  represent two typical coordination 
cages that are self - assembled from six palladium ions and four tridentate ligands. These 
coordination cages are well soluble in water and can selectively encapsulate organic 
substrates in the nano - sized cavity in a well - arranged fashion, mainly through hydropho-
bic and aromatic interactions. So far, a number of different types of photoreactions have 
been examined within the cavities of these molecular cages.  154 – 160   As shown in Scheme 
 1.31 , four stereoisomers  129a - d  are theoretically possible to be formed upon photocy-
clodimerization of  128 . Strikingly, photocyclodimerization of 0.5   mM  128  in the cavity 
of  126a  gave the HT  syn - isomer  129a  as a sole product in  > 98% yield after 3 h irradia-
tion. On the contrary, photoirradiation of  128  in benzene in the absence of host  126a gave 
no adducts even at a high concentration of 150   mM. In the presence of  127a  as a host, 
photocyclodimerization of  130  in aqueous solution exclusively afforded  syn - dimer  131a . 
This is in sharp contrast to the same photoreaction conducted in benzene without any 
host, where  anti - dimer  131b  (21% yield) was favored over  syn - dimer  131a  (2% yield).

The remarkable reactivity and selectivity observed with these molecular vessels are 
attributed to the greatly increased concentration and the strictly regulated orientation of 
substrates in the well - conﬁ ned cavity. 
 The cavity of molecular cage  126a  is achiral in origin. Interestingly, a chiral cavity 
can be constructed simply by replacing the peripheral ethylenediamine with optically 
active diamines, with the original electronic nature, size and T symmetry element being

maintained on the whole. Cross addition of  132 and  133 (Scheme  1.32 ) in the cavity of 
 126b – e  (Scheme  1.30 ) gave a single product  134 , which is ascribed to steric control 
arising from the conﬁ ned cavity rather than orbital control.  158   The optical yields of this 
photoaddition reaction increased upon increasing the steric bulk of the  N - substituent on 
the chiral diamine and ﬁ nally gave  134b  in 50% ee with  126c . This observation is indica-
tive that peripheral chiral auxiliaries, which locate far away from the reaction center and 
induce only a slight deformation of the triazine panel, are possible to produce considerable 
asymmetric induction for the photoreaction occurring in the coordinated cages. 
 1.5  Photochemical Reactions with other Artiﬁ cial Hosts 
 1.5.1  Photochemical Reactions with Dendrimers 
 Dendrimers are highly branched globular molecules which are generally well - deﬁ ned, 
effectively monodispersed and highly symmetric.  161 – 163   A dendrimer is composed of three 
architectural region: a core moiety, branched repeating units derived from the core and 
end groups on the periphery of the molecule. Properly designed high - generation dendrim-
ers possess a distinct interior space that is sterically protected from solvent molecules, 
and therefore dendrimers can serve as container molecules. An elegant  ‘ dendritic box ’ 
that can accommodate small organic molecules and control their release by modifying 
the steric crowding of the dendritic periphery has been described by Meijer  et al. 164 
 Poly(alky aryl ether) dendrimers  135  (Scheme  1.33 ), possessing carboxylic acid or 
hydroxyl group at their periphery, were synthesized and used as hosts for several photo-
reactions. 165 Both  135a  and  135b  are water soluble under the base condition and capable 
of including organic molecules mainly through hydrophobic interaction. Photolysis of 
1 - phenyl - 3 - p - tolyl - 2 - propanone  136  led to   α  - cleavage to form radical pairs, which after 
decarbonylation recombine to give diarylethanes  137a ,  137b  and  137c . The photolysis of 
 136  in hexane solution gave the product  137a ,  137b  and  137c in a ratio 2.4  :  1.0  :  1.4, 
indicating a zero  ‘ cage effect, ’  where the  ‘ cage effect ’  was deﬁ ned as ([ 137a ] – [ 137b ] –
 [ 137c ])/([ 137a ]  +  [ 137b ]  +  [ 137c ]). Interestingly, photoreaction of  136  mediated by G1, 
G2 and G3 acid dendrimers  135b  showed the gradually increasing cage effects of 0.09, 
0.18 and 0.50, respectively, suggesting stronger conﬁ nement with increasing dendrimer

generation. Photolyses of  136  encapsulated by G3 of  135a  gave a larger cage effect of 
0.77, revealing that the phenolic dendrimer  135a  is more strongly conﬁ ning than the acid 
dendrimer  135b . 
 Photolysis of benzoin ethyl ether  138  was demonstrated to be sensitive to the reaction 
media employed. It affords Norrish type I products  139c  and  139d  in more than 94% 
combined yield in hexane but type II products  139a  and  139b  in 73% yield in aqueous 
alkaline solution. Photoreaction of  138  with dendrimer  135b  predominantly gave the type 
II products, particularly  139a  in 95% yield. However, when the photoreaction was medi-
ated by  135a ,  139a and  139b were produced in 21% and 57% yield, respectively, sug-
gesting that the end group plays an important role in dictating the interior character of 
the dendrimers.

 1.5.2  Photochemical Reactions with Hydrogen - Bonding Templates 
 Hydrogen bonding interaction plays vital roles in regulating biochemical processes of 
proteins and deoxyribonucleic acids, and has been widely utilized for constructing 
supramolecular architectures. This is due to the largest interaction energy (5 – 30  kJ  mol  − 1 ) 
among the non - covalent weak interactions as well as the ability to assemble molecules 
at right distance and angle. As a result of these advantages, a series of photochemical 
reactions have been investigated using hydrogen - bonding templates.   
 Bassani and co - workers investigated the complexation behavior of melamine and bar-
bituric acid derivatives, and examined the photodimerization of styrene, stilbene and 
cinnamate mediated by hydrogen bonding templates. 166 – 170 Melamine derivatives  140 
(Scheme  1.34 ), which have a hydrogen - bonding motif complementary to barbituric acid 
derivatives such as  141 , are possible to sequentially form 1  :  1 and 1  :  2 hydrogen - bonded 
complexes with  141 . As illustrated in Scheme  1.35 ,  140  and  141  can form two kinds of 
1   :   1 complexes and three kinds of 1   :   2 complexes, among which only complex C is 
expected to accelerate the photodimerization of  140 . Each of the binding constants K 1 
and K 2  should be a sum of these binding constants weighted by their population. A posi-
tive cooperativity (K 2  >  K 1 ) was observed upon complexation of  141b  with  140a,b , 
presumably as a combined result of allosteric and electronic effects. Photoirradiation of 
 140  without any template led to a fast  E - to - Z  isomerization to give the  Z / E  ratio of 1.1 – 5.5 
at the photostationary state, although elongated irradiations resulted in a formation of 
dimers. The existence of barbiturate  141  considerably improved the efﬁ ciency and selec-
tivity of the photoreaction. The quantum yields of  142a  and  142b  were increased respec-
tively from 0.7  ×  10  − 3 and 0.1  ×  10  − 3 in the absence of a template to 2.3  ×  10  − 3 and 
0.8  ×  10  − 3  in the presence of  141a . 170   The same strategy was applied to a barbituric acid 
derivative of fullerene to give a photodimer of fullerene, which could not been obtained 
without the hydrogen - bonding template. 169 
 Bach and co - workers investigated a series of chiral photoreactions that were mediated 
by Kamp ’ s triacid derivatives  143  working as chiral hydrogen - bonding templates.  171 – 177 
As illustrated in Scheme  1.37 , these chiral templates possess an amide (lactam) group to 
bind an amide substrate through dual hydrogen bonds and also a bulky substituent to 
shield one of the enantiofaces of substrate when bound to the template. Although these

facing side. Increasing the amount of chiral template or lowering the reaction temperature, 
by which the ratio of bound photosubstrate is greatly increased, signiﬁ cantly improved 
the enantioselectivity in the photocycloaddition of  144 . By performing the photoreaction 
in the presence of  143b  at  − 60  ° C,  145  was given in up to 93% ee. In contrast, the same 
reaction sensitized by a chiral sensitizer lacking the hydrogen - bonding site gave only 
racemic photoproducts.  179 
 Since photoexcitation of free substrate existing in the bulk solution will give racemic 
photoproducts, at least an equimolar amount of chiral template is necessary in order to 
obtain photoproduct with good enantioselectivity. A recent report by Bach  et al. presented 
a good solution for this shortcoming by covalently grafting a sensitizer to a chiral tem-
plate. Thus, sensitizing template  143c  (Scheme  1.37 ) bearing a photoinduced electron 
transfer sensitizer was synthesized for the use in photosensitized cycloaddition of  146 . 
Photolysis of  146  in the presence of 0.1 equivalent amount of  143c  afforded  147  in 52 -
 64% yield with up to 70% ee (Scheme  1.39 ). 180

 Mattay  et al. examined the intramolecular [2+2] photocycloadditions of 1,6 - dienes  152 
catalyzed by copper(I) coordinated to chiral ligands  151 (Scheme  1.41 ). 182 Photocycloaddition 
of  152 catalyzed by  151c gave  153 in up to 5% ee. 
 Bassani and co - workers studied the photodimerization of  154  using a synergistic effect 
of hydrogen bonding and metal ion complexation.  183   Photodimerization of  154  was accel-
erated by a factor of 2 in the presence of one equivalent of KPF 6 , and a factor of 5 in the 
coexistence of KPF 6  and  155 . Among the metal ions examined, Ba 2+  showed the most 
signiﬁ cant cooperative effect. While  155  enhanced the photodimerization by a factor of 
1.4 – 1.8, a simultaneous use of  155 and Ba 2+ gave the quantum yield for the formation of 
 156  and  157  in more than three orders of magnitude greater than that obtained in the 
absence of template, and the ratio of  156 / 157 was greatly improved from 1 to 3.7.

 1.6  Photoreaction Control by External Variants 
 While most studies on supramolecular photochemistry have focused on the design and 
synthesis of suitable hosts that provide desirable interaction or environment for aimed 
photosubstrates, recent studies by Inoue  et al.  suggest that the external factors, such as 
temperature, solvent and pressure, may also play a crucial role in controlling the reactivity 
and selectivity of photoreactions in supramolecular systems. Changing environmental 
variants, which is much easier to practice than the optimization of host structure involving 
tedious syntheses, can provide not only a convenient, yet useful, tool for controlling 
photochemical outcomes, but also important information regarding the mechanism of 
supramolecular photochemical reaction. 
 The effect of temperature has been well established in the photosensitized isomerization 
of cycloalkenes with conventional sensitizers.  184 – 187   The change of optical yield upon 
temperature variation is ascribed to the non - zero differential entropy change for the for-
mation of enantiomeric photoproducts. The entropy effect on supramolecular photochi-
rogenesis systems was found to be closely related to the structural properties of 
supramolecular hosts. The enantioselectivity shows only small changes with the variation 
of temperature in photoisomerization of  34Z  sensitized by   β - CD - based chromophores. 37 
This insigniﬁ cant effect of temperature is attributed to the low entropy environment in 
the cavity of   β  - CD due to its rigid skeleton arising from the hydrogen - bonding network 
at the secondary rim. 
 On the contrary, photoisomerization of  158ZZ with sensitizer - appended   γ - CD, which 
has a more ﬂ exible framework than   γ  - CD, is more sensitive to the temperature alternation. 
An inversion of product chirality was observed by lowering the temperature in the pho-
toisomerization of  158ZZ  mediated by  159 . 188   Similar phenomenon was observed in 
photocyclodimerization of AC (Scheme  1.9 ) included in the cavity of   γ - CD derivatives. 189 
The enantioselectivity for HH dimer in the photocyclodimerization of AC with diamino -    γ 
 - CDs  48 in aqueous methanol solution decreased greatly by lowering the reaction tem-
perature and even showed a dramatic inversion to give the antipodal product. When   γ - CD 
derivatives  50a – d with ﬂ exible caps were used, the ee values obtained for  44  were highly 
dependent on the temperature. However, in the presence of   γ - CD derivatives  57a – c , which 
possess a rigid aryldisulfonate cap, the enantiodifferentiation become much less temper-
ature - dependent. 52   On the other hand, when photoisomerization of  34Z  was carried out

with permethylated   β - CD sensitizers  35e – h , in which the hydrogen bonding network is 
broken by methylation to give a ﬂ exible skeleton, the temperature effect became pro-
nounced to afford a chirality inversion by changing the temperature. 
 These observations suggest that the entropy effect is a function of the ﬂ exibility/rigidity 
of the skeleton of supramolecular hosts, and is signiﬁ cant for hosts with ﬂ exible frame-
work but is insigniﬁ cant with rigid hosts. Indeed, works of the other research groups have 
also demonstrated that hosts bearing rigid skeleton such as zeolite show only slight 
temperature - dependence. 
 Solvation and desolvation are of paramount importance for molecular recognition in 
solution. Solvent inﬂ uences the binding strength of host – guest equilibrium in a diverse 
way for various host – guest systems. For example, the complexation strength between 
18 - crown - 6 and potassium ion decreases by a factor of  > 10 4  on going from propylene 
carbonate to water.  190 This signiﬁ cant solvent dependence mainly comes from the differ-
ence in desolvation energy of the metal cation in different solvent. In some cases, solvent 
may play a role of ﬁ ller upon co - inclusion with the guest substrate to signiﬁ cantly modify 
the orientation of substrate in the host cavity. It is known that CD bind organic guests 
mainly through hydrophobic interactions, and addition of methanol to the aqueous solu-
tion greatly reduces the binding constant as a result of increased solvation to both of 
substrate and host. The plot of log Ks for the complexation of  35  and  34Z  against the 
methanol content showed good straight lines, suggesting that no selective solvation by 
water or methanol to CD derivatives occurs and water – methanol mixture behaves as a 
bulk solvent of continuously changing hydrophilicity. The enantioselectivity in photo-
isomerization of  34Z  with  35  decreases with increasing content of methanol, and appears 
to be a nice function of host occupancy. On the other hand, addition of methanol decreases 
the solvent polarity and thus increases the electrostatic interaction of ion pairs. In aqueous 
solution, the photodimerization of AC mediated by  48a – d  shows only subtle effect of the 
ammonium cations introduced to the primary rim of   γ  - CD, but the electrostatic interaction 
dominates the photodimerization to give the chiral HH dimer as the major product with 
a greatly enhanced enantioselectivity. 
 Hydrostatic pressure is also known to play crucial roles in conventional chiral photo-
sensitization of  34Z , as demonstrated by the fact that product chirality can be manipulated 
or even inverted by simply changing the pressure when the differential activation volume 
for the formation of the enantiomeric or diastereomeric pair is not equal to zero. Under 
high pressure, less volume - demanding structures and processes are absolutely favoured 
and hence the host - guest association process is advantageous in principle. If there are two 
or more possible complex structures in a supramolecular system, dramatic equilibrium 
and selectivity shifts may occur from a shallow, loose and/or bulky complex to a deeper, 
tighter and compact ones under high pressure. In other words, we acquire an additional 
tool, that is pressure as an environmental variant, for manipulating the recognition ability 
and selectivity of a given guest. Another somewhat unexpected great advantage of high 
pressure applied to supramolecular systems performed in aqueous solutions is the signiﬁ -
cant lowering of the melting temperature of water, which goes down to  − 25  ° C at 210  MPa, 
which enables us to perform photochemical reactions below zero Celsius even in water. 
Thus, the chemical yield and ee of HT dimer  44  were greatly enhanced in the photocy-
clodimerization of AC mediated by   γ  - CD derivatives to reach 53% yield and 71% ee by 
using host  54 in water at  − 22  ° C at 210  MPa.

 More recently, the effect of pH was investigated in the supramolecular photochirogenic 
dimerization of AC with  p - cresolbisbenzimidazole - capped   γ - CDs  160a,b . 191 Thus, pho-
todimerization of AC with AE - capped   γ - CD  160b  gave  anti  - HH dimer in 5% ee at pH 
11 but the antipodal product in 28% ee at pH 6. The conformational change of the ioniz-
able capping moiety upon the pH variation is responsible for the pH - dependent 
enantioselectivity. 
 1.7  Conclusions 
 Controlling photochemistry through molecular recognition has drawn signiﬁ cant interest 
from a broad spectrum of scientists and met great progress in recent decades. A number 
of supramolecular hosts have been successfully exploited for conducting various types of 
photochemical reactions to reveal the distinct advantages and disadvantages peculiar to 
each supramolecular system. The multiple non - covalent interactions and the conﬁ nement 
effect operating in host cavity are two major factors that control the supramolecular 
photochemistry. Successful supramolecular photoreaction requires reasonable design and 
synthesis of host molecules and a careful selection of suitable photoreaction and substrate. 
The complementary ﬁ tting of size, shape and interaction motif between host and guest 
substrate are crucially important in choosing a host – guest pair for speciﬁ c supramolecular 
photochemistry. In general, supramolecular hosts that have more conﬁ ned binding sites 
usually show speciﬁ c complexation ability and signiﬁ cant reaction selectivity, while those 
with ﬂ exible binding sites are susceptive to the external control by environmental factors. 
 The supramolecular approach to photochemistry is undoubted a smart efﬁ cient way to 
manipulate and enhance its reactivity and selectivity. In addition to the electronic and 
orbital properties governing the conventional photoreactions in isotropic media, the steric 
and conformational effects play heavier roles in supramolecular photochemistry. As a 
result, photoreactions in supramolecular systems often show unique behavior distinctively 
different from that of conventional one. On the other hand, the conﬁ nement effect of 
supramolecular hosts can hold two or more photosubstrates in close proximity and con-
sequentially promote bi -  and multimolecular photoreactions that are silent in conventional 
photochemistry under normal conditions.

37
 Despite that supramolecular complexation can crucially affect the steric and/or elec-
tronic properties of photosubstrates in both ground and excited state, the stereochemical 
control of photochemical reaction in supramolecular systems is often considered to be 
dominated by the prearrangement of photosubstrate in the ground state. A photosubstrate 
is captured by a host for a period of time that is much longer than the excited - state life-
time. It has been demonstrated that the rate constant for a photosubstrate to get into the 
cavity of host with a sufﬁ ciently large opening is normally in the order 10  − 7 – 10  − 8  M  − 1  S  − 1 . 192 
An organic guest may stay in the cavity for much longer than 1    µ s if it has a binding 
constant of 1000   M  − 1  with the host, which is signiﬁ cantly longer than the lifetime of 
excited molecules commonly encountered. Therefore, the complexation behaviour of 
photosubstrate in the ground state is of signiﬁ cant importance in supramolecular 
photochemistry. 
 Optimizing the structure and interactions of a supramolecular system still requires 
sophisticated design, synthesis, and experimental feedback even in the ground state, and 
should be much more difﬁ cult for supramolecular photochemical reactions. In this context, 
the combined use of external factors, such as temperature, solvent and pressure, provides 
a versatile and convenient tool for manipulating photochemical reactions in supramolecu-
lar system. The role of these external factors is closely correlated with the properties, in 
particular rigidity, of supramolecular host employed, and the outcomes are often signiﬁ -
cantly different from those observed in conventional photoreactions, which would be 
another reason for performing photochemical reaction in supramolecular system. 
 The number and quality of publications on supramolecular photochirogenesis are 
rapidly growing in the last decade. Laying in the interdisciplinary area of supramolecular 
chemistry, photochemistry and asymmetric synthesis, this new area of science is still 
challenging but appears promising, proposing a novel concept and methodology for 
overcoming the relatively weak and short - lived interactions in the excited state through 
multiple supramolecular interactions in both ground and excited states. Indeed, the highest 
enantioselectivity in solution - phase photoreaction has been achieved by supramolecular 
photochirogenesis. 193 
 In summary, the control of photochemical reactions by molecular recognition becomes 
one of the most active topics in supramolecular chemistry in recent years. However, 
supramolecular photochemistry is still conceptually less established, mechanistically less 
understood, and experimentally less explored compared to the conventional supramolecu-
lar chemistry in the ground state. We believe that further comprehensive studies in this 
area will reveal more intriguing features of supramolecular photochemistry and strength 
our capability to control photochemical reactions.

Cyclodextrins  
 Ronald  Breslow 
 Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 
 2.1  Introduction 
 Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligomers of glucose (Figure  2.1 ). The most common are   α -
 cyclodextrin with six glucoses in a ring ( 1 ),   β  - cyclodextrin with seven glucoses ( 2 ), and 
 γ - cyclodextrin ( 3 ) with eight glucoses in the ring. Because of all the sugar hydroxyls these 
compounds are reasonably soluble in water but the interior cavities are relatively non -
 polar, with about the polarity of dioxane. Thus in water the cyclodextrins can reversibly 
bind hydrophobic substrates into their cavities, and within the complexes chemical reac-
tions can occur. 
 Friedrich Cramer did the ﬁ rst work in this area,  1   and early work was done by Myron 
Bender. 2,3   In Bender ’ s studies, a bound ester reacted with a hydroxyl group on the rim of 
the cyclodextrin to undergo a transesteriﬁ cation, with reasonable geometric selectivity 
and some rate acceleration. This was followed up with substrates better designed to be 
accelerated by such a process, and this will be the ﬁ rst part of the review. Then there are 
some reactions in which cyclodextrin promotes a process but is not itself transformed, 
and the ﬁ rst example of this was work we reported on selective aromatic substitution, the 
second section of this review. I also describe the use of cyclodextrins to catalyse Diels –
 Alder reactions, in which both the diene and the dienophile can bind into the cyclodextrin 
cavity in water and in  ‘ water - like ’ solvents.

 Then systems are described in which the cyclodextrin binding group has catalytic 
groups attached to it, to mimic enzymes whose binding groups and catalytic groups are 
not the same. The ﬁ rst section describes catalysed hydrolysis reactions with metal ions 
bound to ligands that are attached to one or two cyclodextrins. Then mimics of ribonu-
clease enzymes in which two catalytic groups are attached in well - deﬁ ned positions to a 
cyclodextrin are described. There follows brief descriptions of studies on simple binding 
by cyclodextrin dimers and trimers. 
 Extensive studies on mimics of transaminase enzymes follow, and then mimics of 
enzymes that use thiamine pyrophosphate as their coenzyme. Studies on mimics of 
enzymes that perform aldol condensations are then described. After a brief section on 
mimics of enzymes that use coenzyme B 12  as a coenzyme, there is a description of mimics 
of cytochrome P - 450 oxidizing enzymes, in which as many as four cyclodextrins are 
involved in binding. 
 We have written a number of reviews of our work in this ﬁ eld. 4 – 16   Our chapter in 
Chemical Reviews  14   was particularly comprehensive, and covered the work in many other 
laboratories besides our own. There are actually two other chapters on reactions in cyclo-
dextrins in this book.  17,18   It has been agreed that each of our laboratories will concentrate 
chieﬂ y on the work that we ourselves have done. 
 2.2  Acylations of the Cyclodextrins by Bound Substrates 
 Myron Bender had reported that a meta -  t - butylphenyl acetate ( 4 ) acetylated   β - cyclodextrin 
in water with a rate 250 times as fast as that for hydrolysis of that same substrate at 
the same pH.  2   We had shown that the same reaction was even faster in a mixed DMSO/
water solvent, but still the acceleration was not what one would have hoped for.  19 
Model - building suggested that in the acylation reaction the tetrahedral intermediate is 
partly pulled out of the cavity, so cyclodextrin binding is to some extent ﬁ ghting against 
the reaction rate. Thus we made a new substrate, the  p - nitrophenyl ester of ferrocene-
acrylic acid ( 5 ), and saw that it acylated   β  - cyclodextrin with a rate acceleration of 
51,000 compared with the hydrolysis rate in free solution.  20   With this substrate there

 The cyclodextrin ring does not have a well - deﬁ ned depth, so we adopted a simple 
procedure to turn it from an open tube into a cup. We attached some ﬂ exible groups on 
the primary carbons of the cyclodextrin that could partially invade the cavity and produce 
a ﬂ exible ﬂ oor. 21   Later we studied acylation reactions with cyclodextrins that had been 
modiﬁ ed to include a ﬂ oor on the bottom of the cavity  –  and also with improved substrates 
and a somewhat better solvent  – that led to a relative rate of 750,000 compared with the 
uncatalysed hydrolysis rate at the same pH.  22   When we looked at related compounds in 
which we had frozen out one of the degrees of freedom of the substrate the improvement 
came up to a 3,200,000 - fold acceleration compared with the hydrolysis rate in water, and 
with some selectivity among the geometries of the complex. 23 
 In a later study on the optimization of metallocene substrates for such cyclodextrin 
reactions we saw that the two different enantiomers ( 6 ) of a fused ring system  –  in which 
there was no substrate ﬂ exibility  –  was 62 - fold faster for one enantiomer than the other 
and showed a rate 150 million times as fast for acylation as was the rate of hydrolysis in 
water at the same pH.  24   We then addressed this with molecular modeling calculations, 
and saw that quantitative theory accounted well for these ﬁ ndings. 25

 When the leaving group on these esters was less reactive than  p - nitrophenoxide, we 
and Menger had seen that the rate acceleration decreased strongly.  26,27 We reasoned that 
a completely rigid substrate has a problem if the rate - determining step involves forward 
decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate, since it is necessary for the ester carbonyl 
to rotate in the ﬁ nal product. This explained why reactions whose rate - determining step 
involved the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate were very fast, while those in which 
forward decomposition of the intermediate to the product was rate determining were not 
nearly so well accelerated. We solved this problem by putting in one degree of rotational 
freedom in the substrate, which permitted the needed rotation, and saw that now there 
was no abnormal behaviour of the  p - nitrophenoxide group. 26 
 In a different experimental approach to the question of geometric changes during the 
acylation reaction of cyclodextrin bound substrates, we collaborated with Le Noble in a 
study of pressure effects on the reaction rates. 28   The volume changes that this technique 
indicated  –  as starting materials proceeded to the transition state  –  were consistent with

the conclusions we had reached from earlier studies of rate dependences on substrate 
geometries.  
 2.3  Catalytic Reactions in Cyclodextrin Cavities: Aromatic Substitution 
 In the previous reactions the cyclodextrin acted as a reactant, not a catalyst. However, 
there are some excellent examples in which true catalysis occurs with simple binding into 
a cyclodextrin cavity. Here we will describe the cases where the cyclodextrin has not 
been modiﬁ ed, while in later sections we will discuss cases in which additional catalytic 
groups have been added to the cyclodextrin, and mimics of metalloenzymes and of 
enzymes with co - enzymes have been achieved. 
 In our earlier study we saw that we could achieve geometric selectivity in the chlorina-
tion of anisole by HOCl in water solution.  29   In simple water solution we saw a 1.5 ratio 
of  para  chlorination to  ortho  chlorination of the anisole, while in a 9   mM concentration 
of  α - cyclodextrin the  para - to  ortho  - ratio was 29.6. Under these conditions the anisole 
was only 72% bound into the cavity, so these results indicated that the cyclodextrin not 
only covered the  ortho  positions, it also actively catalysed the  para chlorination. The 
most reasonable idea about this was that one of the hydroxyl groups of the cyclodextrin 
reacted with HOCl to become a hypochlorite group, and that this then delivered the 
chlorine to the  para position of the bound anisole (Figure  2.2 ). 
 In a subsequent detailed study we saw that the chlorination of unbound anisole involved 
two molecules of HOCl, surely as their very reactive product Cl 2 O, while the chlorination 
in the complex involved only a single molecule of HOCl. The obvious conclusion from 
this is that the HOCl reacts with a hydroxyl group of the cyclodextrin to make a hypochlo-
rite that is able to donate a chlorine atom to the  para  position of bound anisole, which is 
the one accessible when the anisole is fully bound. Proximity makes up for the weak 
chlorinating ability of a hypochlorite. 
 In a full paper we examined this system in more detail.  30   We found that a substituting 
reagent, a diazonium ion that could not be delivered by a cyclodextrin hydroxy, was not 
catalysed by the cyclodextrin, since the diazonium group could not be covalently linked 
to a hydroxyl of the cyclodextrin and still be an electrophile. As another piece of evidence, 
when we looked at  para  - methoxytoluene we saw that binding to the cyclodextrin now 
inhibited chlorination, which of course occurred on the  ortho - chloro position. However, 
with  para - cresol there was again chlorination ortho to the oxygen, but this was now cata-
lysed by the cyclodextrin binding. In this case, in contrast to the methoxytoluene, the 
polar hydroxyl group would be expected to protrude from the cavity, bringing the  ortho 
position within reach of chlorines covalently linked to hydroxyl groups.

 In another paper related to this chemistry we examined   α - cyclodextrin in which all 
of the C - 6 and C - 2 hydroxyl groups were methylated.  31   We found that this was also 
an excellent selective catalyst for the chlorinations, and in particular because anisole 
binds more strongly into this somewhat more hydrophobic cavity we saw that the 
selectivity was even higher, reﬂ ecting a higher proportion of bound substrate. This 
demonstrates that the C - 3 hydroxyl can be the one that delivers the chlorine to the 
substrate, although it does not rule out the possibility of other hydroxyls being involved 
in the case where we do not have them selectively methylated. In the same paper we 
also prepared a polymer of   α - cyclodextrin by cross - linking it with epichlorhydrin. We 
saw that this polymer was an excellent catalyst for the selective chlorination of anisole, 
and when a water solution of anisole and HOCl was simply run down a column con-
taining the polymer the product was essentially completely chlorinated in the  para 
position. 
 One extra point might be mentioned about these catalysts. There is an enzyme, chlo-
rinase, that will also chlorinate anisole but with only the random 60/40 distribution 
between  para  and  ortho  chlorination. The enzyme obviously has not been optimized for 
this process, but it is fair to say that our very simple artiﬁ cial enzyme,   α - cyclodextrin, is 
actually better at selective chlorination of this substrate than the enzyme is. 
 2.3.1  Catalytic Reactions in Cyclodextrin Cavities: Diels – Alder Reactions 
 We also examined Diels – Alder reactions in a cyclodextrin complex.  32   In the reaction of 
cyclopentadiene with 2 - butenone (Figure  2.3 ) or with acrylonitrile we saw that there was 
catalysis in water with  β  - cyclodextrin, but not with   α  - cyclodextrin, which was an inhibi-
tor. The cyclopentadiene bound into both of the cyclodextrins, but only in the   β -
 cyclodextrin is there also room for the dienophile to ﬁ t. In this same publication  32 we saw 
that the Diels – Alder reaction is also strongly accelerated simply in water solution, which 
favours the transition state for the reaction in which a smaller total amount of hydrophobic 
surface is exposed to the water solvent. This latter ﬁ nding stimulated us, and others, to 
study many other examples of catalytic effects in water alone with hydrophobic reagents. 
However, the cyclodextrin effect was added on top of this in the case where both reagents 
could ﬁ t into the pocket. 
 2.4  Other Solvents than Water 
 In a later study we examined Diels – Alder reactions in non - aqueous polar solvents, both 
in the solvents alone and in the solvents with   β - cyclodextrin. 33 We found that DMSO did 
not promote   β  - cyclodextrin binding, but that it was promoted by both ethylene glycol and

formamide. Thus the  ‘ hydrophobic ’  binding induced by water can be duplicated to a lesser 
extent with these other water - like solvents. 
 In a previous study on simple cyclodextrin binding we examined the ability of cyclo-
dextrin to bind various substrates in dimethyl sulfoxide solution rather than in water.  19 
We saw that indeed hydrophobic substances were bound into the cyclodextrin, and also 
that DMSO itself was a solvent in which the acylation of a cyclodextrin hydroxyl group 
by a bound ester could be observed. Cyclodextrin binding is not exclusively limited to 
water solutions, as had been suggested by others previously, but water is so far the best 
solvent to see such binding and catalytic processes. 
 2.5  Catalytic Reactions Produced by Cyclodextrins With Covalently 
Attached Catalytic Groups 
 2.5.1  Catalysed Hydrolysis Reactions 
 Combining a cyclodextrin for substrate binding with catalysis of a reaction by some 
attached groups seems to be the best approach so far for the production of artiﬁ cial 
enzymes that imitate the situation in natural enzymes, where binding and catalysis nor-
mally involve different enzyme groups. Catalytic groups can be attached to either the 
primary or the secondary face of a cyclodextrin, and on the secondary face there are both 
carbon - 2 and carbon - 3 positions to which attachment can be made. We synthesized some 
 β - cyclodextrin compounds carrying phosphate groups at the carbon - 2, carbon - 3, or 
carbon - 6 positions and compared their effectiveness as general acids or as general base 
catalysts with bound substrates.  34 All were to some extent catalytic. 
 The ﬁ rst compound described as an  ‘ artiﬁ cial enzyme ’  in the literature was the one we 
reported in which we attached a metal ion binding group to   α - cyclodextrin. 35 We found 
that this would bind  p  - nitrophenyl acetate into the cavity and a bound nickel ion then 
catalysed the hydrolysis of the substrate. This was a direct hydrolysis, not an acylation 
of a cyclodextrin hydroxyl (which is not in reach with the  para  esters). This type of cata-
lyst then extends metal - catalysed reactions to substrates that do not intrinsically bind to 
metal ions, which was formerly required for such catalysis. 
 Even better rates of hydrolysis were seen when a cyclodextrin dimer was used in which 
the linking group had a metal ion bound in a position to be able to catalyse hydrolysis of 
an appropriate substrate. In our ﬁ rst example (Figure  2.4 ) we showed that a dipeptide 
could bind across such a metal binding linker, and that its afﬁ nity for binding was 
increased when the linker carried a zinc ion that could coordinate to the peptide group.  36 
However, this was not powerful enough to catalyse the cleavage of the peptide. With

esters involving two hydrophobic groups we saw outstanding acceleration of catalysis, 
with acceleration 220,000 - fold faster than the simple rate of uncatalysed hydrolysis under 
the same conditions. This was comparable to the rate acceleration seen at the time by the 
best catalytic antibodies. 
 Interestingly, in a study of the binding of ditopic substrates to such cyclodextrin dimers 
we saw that the binding was dominated by an improved enthalpy, rather than entropy.  37 
The simplest ideas about chelate binding would have suggested an entropy advantage, 
but in solution enthalpy – entropy compensation can be seen if the binding or release of 
water molecules is also considered. 
 In a later study we examined the ability of cyclodextrin dimers linked by a bipyridyl 
unit to catalyse the hydrolysis of a phosphate ester,  bis - p - nitrophenyl phosphate. 38 With 
a bound lanthanum ion the hydrolysis was accelerated by 300 million - fold, a huge accel-
eration that could well be of practical interest in the hydrolysis of phosphate esters gener-
ally. A full paper described this work in some detail. 39 
 In earlier work we had demonstrated that a zinc complex of pyridyl - 2 - carboxaldoxime 
( 7 ) could be effective in cleaving esters. The interesting point is that the oxime anion is 
available as a nucleophile and the zinc as an electrophile, but they are not coordinated to 
each other  –  which would of course destroy the catalytic effect. To amplify catalysis we 
attached such oxime - zinc complexes to   β - cyclodextrin on both the secondary and primary 
faces of the cyclodextrin and examined their reaction with  p - nitrophenyl acetate. 40 We 
observed burst kinetics, in which there was an extremely rapid release of one mole of 
nitrophenoxide ion, followed by a slower release in a second phase. This indicated that 
we ﬁ rst rapidly produced the acetate of the oxime, and this then slowly hydrolysed to 
regenerate the oxime anion for further catalytic reaction. Such burst kinetics is very com-
monly seen in enzymatic reactions of  para - nitrophenyl acetate, reﬂ ecting the same kind 
of two - step overall mechanism.

 One problem with such studies is that  p  - nitrophenyl acetate is a highly reactive ester, 
and it is more of a challenge to catalyse the hydrolysis of ordinary esters or of amides. 
In a move in this direction we showed that an appropriate cyclodextrin dimer with a bound 
copper ion ( 8 ) could indeed catalyse the hydrolysis of an ordinary ester group, not a 
phenyl ester. 41 The acceleration was 18,000 - fold, certainly a respectable catalytic result. 
 2.5.2  Ribonuclease Mimics 
 The class of enzymes known as ribonucleases catalyses two separate reactions (Figure 
 2.5 ). In the ﬁ rst one a phosphate diester between two RNA units is cleaved by attack of 
the C - 2 hydroxyl to convert the species into a cyclic phosphate with release of the other 
RNA unit, so the chain is cleaved. In a second reaction ribonuclease catalyses the conver-
sion of the cyclic phosphate back to an open - chain phosphate monoester. In both reactions

ribonuclease A uses two catalytic groups  –  the imidazoles of histidine 12 and histidine 119 
 –  using one as a base catalyst and the other, in its protonated form, as an acid catalyst.   
 In the cyclization - cleavage, histidine - 12 is the base that removes the proton from the 
C - 2 hydroxyl group of ribose and histidine - 119 is the acid group that eventually proto-
nates the leaving oxygen of the second nucleoside. In the hydrolysis of the cyclic phos-
phate these roles are reversed, with the now deprotonated histidine - 119 acting as a base 
to deliver a water molecule while the protonated histidine - 12 now acts to protonate the 
leaving C - 2 oxygen that had originally attacked in the formation of the cyclic phosphate. 
This reversal of roles explains why the cyclic phosphate is not cleaved as rapidly by the 
enzyme as would normally be required for a reactive intermediate. The cyclic phosphate 
presented to the enzyme in its starting protonation state would not have the acid and base 
groups in the right position for the second cleavage step. In a sense this is almost a see -
 saw mechanism, in which ﬁ rst a base and acid combination produces cyclic phosphate 
and then the resulting new base and acid combination catalyses the second step. 
 The cleavage of the cyclic phosphate is particularly interesting because it is relatively 
well deﬁ ned in geometry, compared to the somewhat ﬂ exible phosphate diester group. 
For this reason we undertook a study of catalysed hydrolysis of a rigid cyclic phosphate, 
a mimic of that formed with RNA itself. In our initial study we used the cyclic phosphate 
of  t - butyl - catechol ( 9 ) as the substrate, and cyclodextrins carrying two attached imidazole 
rings as catalysts.  42   Tabushi reported the preparation of compound in which   β - cyclodextrin 
was converted to a disulfonate derivative on the primary side.  43   We have used this com-
pound to make a cyclodextrin  bis - imidazole ( 10 ) by simple displacement with imidazole, 
and used it as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of the catechol cyclic phosphate  9 . All of our 
evidence indicated that this disulfonation was not speciﬁ c, so  10  was a mixture of what 
we call the AB and AC  bis - imidazoles, in which the glucose rings of   β - cyclodextrin are 
lettered sequentially from A through G.

 We saw that this  bis  - imidazole mixture was a powerful catalyst for the hydrolysis of 
the cyclic phosphate, showing two exciting new aspects. First of all it was in fact a 
bifunctional catalyst whose plot of pH  vs.  rate was a bell - shaped curve, just as with the 
natural enzyme ribonuclease itself. Furthermore, it was a much better catalyst than cyclo-
dextrin mono - imidazole, obtained from simple cyclodextrin tosylate. In addition, the 
reaction was highly speciﬁ c with respect to the product, cleaving the cyclic phosphate so 
as to leave the phosphate on oxygen 3 and the new 4 - hydroxy group  para  to the  t - butyl 
group in  11 . This is the selectivity expected if the imidazole is able to deliver a water 
molecule to the cyclic phosphate in a line more or less perpendicular to the rotational axis 
of the cyclodextrin, as models suggested. In this hydrolysis the two imidazoles are playing 
the same role as they do in the enzyme, with the basic imidazole delivering the water 
molecule to the phosphate by acting as a general base to remove the proton while the 
imidazolium ion acts to furnish a proton for the cleavage (Figure  2.6 ). 
 At the time we assumed that this used the mechanism commonly proposed for such 
processes, in which the proton was simply delivered to the leaving group. However, other 
work, to be described shortly, indicated that the mechanism of this cleavage is more 
interesting than this simple idea suggests. In a subsequent study we examined a cyclo-
dextrin  bis  - imidazole in which the imidazole rings were held further from the cyclodextrin 
through a sulfur - carbon bridge.  44   In this case the water was delivered in a somewhat dif-
ferent direction, and now the cleavage of the cyclic phosphate involved a preferential 
formation of the monophosphate with the phosphorus on the  para  oxygen while the meta 
oxygen was present as the free hydroxyl group. In this paper we also indicated that the 
imidazolium ion could be coordinated to one of the phosphate oxygens rather than simply 
delivering a proton to the leaving group, a bit of foresight that was eventually proven to 
be correct. 
 A striking result was observed when we synthesized a new isomer of the cyclodextrin 
 bis  - imidazole, one in which the imidazole groups were attached to the primary carbons 
of two neighboring glucose units, the so - called AB isomer.  45   By the ordinary mechanism 
 –  in which a water is delivered by a general base imidazole to the phosphorus as the 
imidazolium ion of the second catalyst protonates the leaving group  – this isomer should 
have been essentially inactive, since the 180 degree requirement for the previous mecha-
nism is impossible with these two neighboring imidazoles. However, this turned out to

be the most potent of all three  bis  - imidazoles (we had in the meantime learned to prepare 
both the AC and AD isomers as pure materials, not as a mixture). 
 The observation that the AB isomer of cyclodextrin bisimidazole is the most potent 
catalyst requires a new mechanism (Figure  2.7 ). The imidazolium cation is putting the 
proton on a phosphate oxygen anion instead of on the leaving group, so the two protons 
that are moving need to be much closer, more or less 90 degrees apart rather than 180 
degrees. Such a mechanism requires that the cleavage be a two - step process in which the 
ﬁ rst step involves the addition of water to the phosphate to make a ﬁ ve - coordinate phos-
phorus, a phosphorane anion. In a second step this anion has to cleave to liberate the free 
ribose hydroxyl group with assistance by an imidazolium cation. 
 This mechanism is really unambiguous for the model system, so we were interested to 
see whether we could ﬁ nd any evidence for it as well in the cleavage of RNA by imidazole 
buffers. In work that we will not describe further in this review, since it does not involve 
cyclodextrin chemistry, we were indeed able to get convincing evidence that imidazole 
buffers cleave the simple dinucleotide uridyluridine through such a phosphorane interme-
diate rather than by direct cleavage.  46   We also proposed that this might well be preferred 
by the enzyme itself, and offered some arguments for this, although it is not universally 
accepted as the mechanism for the enzyme. 
 We had invoked a simultaneous two proton transfer mechanism rather than a sequential 
mechanism  –  in which one catalytic group followed the other in the overall process  – and 
were able to test this with a technique called proton inventory.  47   We examined the original 
cyclodextrin  bis  - imidazole in mixtures of water and D 2 O and saw that the rate constant 
as a function of deuterium concentration followed a curved line, indicating that the isotope 
effect involved two different protons rather than a single one. To validate this, we also 
examined the same kind of plot with the cyclodextrin mono - imidazole, in which only one 
proton would be expected to be moving in the transition state, and this indeed followed 
a linear plot supporting a single proton motion in the isotope effect. 
 Some of this work is described in reviews that include the cyclodextrin work.  48 – 51 We 
also examined a comparison of catalysts with the AB placement of imidazoles but based 
on either   α - cyclodextrin,  β - cyclodextrin or   γ  - cyclodextrin. And these were also compared 
with substrates carrying various groups other than  t  - butyl. The conclusion from this work 
was that by far the best rates and selectivities were seen in cases where there was a very

tight ﬁ t between substrate and catalyst cyclodextrin ring, giving the best deﬁ nition of the 
geometry of the system and resulting in the highest rate constant. 52 
 Some years ago we had studied the cleavage of the simple nucleotide uridyluridine by 
a combination of imidazole buffer and zinc ion. We found that they were very effective 
cooperative catalysts for the process, much more effective that simple imidazole buffer 
alone. 53   Thus we prepared a bifunctional catalyst based on   β - cyclodextrin in which we 
attached one imidazole ring and one metal ligand group, and saw that they were effective 
catalysts for the cleavage of the  t - butylcatechol cyclic phosphate. 54   This is a model for 
the many metalloenzymes containing not only a metal ion but also a basic group as part 
of the catalytic centre. In this paper we reported that the combination of a zinc ion chelate 
and an imidazole were more effective than simple imidazole buffer in cyclizing a model 
for RNA and then cleaving it. This is an attractive lead for the synthesis of a related 
cyclodextrin compound, which has not yet been studied. 
 2.6  Binding by Cyclodextrins and their Dimers and Trimers 
 We saw very strong binding of lithocholic acid to   β - cyclodextrin. 55 The AB  cis geometry 
in this substrate made it ﬁ t particularly well into the cyclodextrin cavity. This study was 
related to the studies on steroid oxidations that we will describe later. We took up a study 
of the binding by cyclodextrin dimers.  56   With various linkers between the cyclodextrins, 
which were attached on both the primary and the secondary faces, we saw cooperative 
very strong binding of a number of substrates with two groups that could bind into a 
cyclodextrin cavity. Interestingly, cholesterol as a substrate is large enough to be able to 
bridge into the two rings of some cyclodextrin dimers.  57   We saw evidence for such binding 
in both well - deﬁ ned cyclodextrin dimers and also in cyclodextrin polymers in which there 
were of course dimeric sections that could encompass both ends of the cholesterol in 
binding. 
 Even more strikingly, when we linked two cyclodextrins with a pair of linkers attached 
to the A and B glucose residues we saw two dimers that had very different binding prop-
erties (Figure  2.8 ). 58   When the linkage was from the A residue of one to the B residue of 
the other the result was a structure we described as the  ‘ clamshell ’ , in which it was pos-
sible for a substrate to bind simultaneously into the two rings. When the linkage was from 
the A residue of one cyclodextrin to the A residue of the other, and B to B, the result was 
that we had a structure we described as a  ‘ loveseat ’  in which no substrate could occupy 
both cyclodextrins at the same time because the linkers interfered with such binding. We

also described the clamshell version as  ‘ occlusive ’  while the loveseat was described as 
 ‘ aversive ’ . The aversive isomer showed normal binding of substrates with two binding 
ends, with no cooperative binding of both ends into the dimer. On the other hand the 
occlusive isomer had a binding constant as high as 10 10  M  − 1 . This corresponded to a free 
energy larger than additive, as expected for chelate binding.   
 We have found that what we called  ‘ antihydrophobic ’ agents could increase the solu-
bilities of hydrocarbon groups in water and would also decrease their ability to bind into 
cyclodextrin. In a quantitative study we saw that the free energies corresponding to these 
two processes were the same, indicating that the decreased binding principally resulted 
from effects on the substrate, not on the cyclodextrin.  59   We also examined these effects 
on the binding of cyclodextrin dimers. As described earlier,  60   we have looked at cyclo-
dextrin dimers with catalytic groups in the linker as catalysts for hydrolysis processes. A 
full paper summarized some of the results of these binding studies.  61 
 We also examined the synthesis and binding properties of some cyclodextrin trimers.  62 
With substrates that might be able to occupy all three of the binding cavities we did see 
improved binding compared with that for cyclodextrin dimers, but not by as large a factor 
as one might have expected. It seems likely that we have not yet achieved the correct 
non - ﬂ exible geometry in the case of the trimers. I will describe another example of 
binding to a cyclodextrin trimer in the section on mimics of cytochrome P - 450 enzymes. 
 We have examined some of possible applications of the strong binding by cyclodextrin 
dimers. In one study we examined the use of cyclodextrin dimers with a light - cleavable 
link as a possible carrier for the photosensitizer in photodynamic tumor therapy.  63,64 The 
idea, which was demonstrated, is that irradiating the complex would cause singlet oxygen 
to cleave the linker, whereupon the substrate would be released from the dimer since it 
did not have the advantage of chelate binding. If this occurred at the tumor site, because 
irradiation was directed there, this could lead to concentration of the photodynamic mate-
rial right next to the tumor. This should avoid the problem that photodynamic processes 
can otherwise occur throughout the body, usually with unpleasant or toxic effects. 
 We also examined the binding of various peptides to   β - cyclodextrin. Simple   β -
 cyclodextrin itself showed selective binding of particular dipeptides, reﬂ ecting the 
sequence of hydrophobic side chains.  65   Protein aggregation in solution normally involves 
the binding to each other of hydrophobic surfaces in the protein monomers, so cyclodex-
trin binding might well be expected to disrupt this. In one study we saw that indeed 
cyclodextrin dimers could disrupt protein aggregation, a ﬁ nding that could lead to selec-
tively useful processes.  66   In a cooperative study we saw that some of our dimers and even 
trimers acted as inhibitors of amyloid peptide aggregation, the process that is damaging 
in Alzheimer ’ s disease. 67 
 Helical structures are important in proteins, and the extent of helix formation in a given 
polypeptide can be inﬂ uenced by external factors. In a study related to this question we 
saw that with appropriate cyclodextrin dimers we could induce helix formation in some 
oligopeptides if the helix structure presented hydrophobic side chains in a geometry such 
that our dimer could bind to them, stabilizing the helix. 68

process in which the pyridoxal phosphate is then converted back to pyridoxamine phos-
phate by the sacriﬁ ce of a different amino acid, which is converted to its ketoacid. We 
have imitated the ﬁ rst part of this process, the conversion of pyridoxamine to pyridoxal 
while making a ketoacid into an amino acid, and studied how we could promote this 
process with the help of binding to cyclodextrins. In later work we have shown how 
some polyamine substances can also catalyse such a process, and can as well catalyse a 
reverse process in which the pyridoxamine is regenerated, so the overall process is in 
fact catalytic. We will describe this regeneration of pyridoxamine at the end of this 
section. 
 In our ﬁ rst study we attached a pyridoxamine unit to a primary carbon of   β - cyclodextrin 
(structure  12 ). 69   We saw that pyridoxamine alone is able to transaminate pyruvic acid to 
form alanine, phenylpyruvic acid to form phenylalanine, and indolepyruvic acid to form 
tryptophan, all with equal reactivity by competition experiments. However, when the 
cyclodextrin was attached to the pyridoxamine there was a 200 - fold preference for the 
indolepyruvate over pyruvate in one - to - one competition, forming greater than 98% of 
tryptophan, and in the competition with phenylpyruvate and pyruvate the phenylalanine 
was formed in greater than 98% as well. Thus the ability of the substrates to bind into 
the cyclodextrin cavity led to striking selectivities. In addition there was some chiral 
induction in these processes, since   β  - cyclodextrin is itself chiral, but the magnitudes of 
the induction were quite modest.

 We devised a method to perform the selective tosylation of the C - 2 hydroxyl group in 
 β - cyclodextrin, 70   and used it to attach the pyridoxamine to this secondary side of the 
cyclodextrin. 71   Again we saw some preference for transamination of the aromatic ketoac-
ids, but by less than we had observed with the pyridoxamine attached to C - 6. The tryp-
tophan synthesis was only 25 times as fast as that for alanine, while the phenylalanine 
formation was 18 times as fast as alanine in competitive reactions. Modest enantioselec-
tivities were observed as well with this C - 2 linked pyridoxamine, and they differed in 
detail from those produced with the C - 6 isomer that we had reported earlier.

 We also examined an interesting modiﬁ ed version in which the   β - cyclodextrin had a 
pyridoxamine attached to the primary C - 6 carbon but the other six hydroxymethyl groups 
on the primary side were deoxygenated to become methyl groups. This leads to quite a 
different hydrophobic cavity,  72   but it showed properties similar to those of the original 
compound that still had its primary hydroxyls unmodiﬁ ed. 
 In a full paper we described this work in detail, including some work on pyridoxamine 
derivatives that did not involve cyclodextrins and other work in which a synthetic binding 
group was used instead of the cyclodextrin.  73 
 We also set about to see whether we could get good chiral induction in the product 
amino acids, not by the simple accident of the chirality of the cyclodextrin but by basic 
groups that could direct the proton transfer involved in transamination so as to give a 
preference for one enantiomer of the product amino acid. We described some of this 
work, 74   and in it also referred to work reported by Tabushi in which the same general 
principle was applied. In our work only relatively modest selectivities were seen; the 
largest optical ratio (L/D) in the product was only 6.8. 
 In the meantime the Tabushi laboratory had prepared a somewhat different version of 
this idea and had reported outstanding optical ratios. 75   In his paper my name was included 
simply because I had proposed the original idea, but I did not have any interaction with 
the experimental evidence. In our later work we found that attempts to repeat the work 
reported in reference 75 did not lead to the reported results. 
 The pyridoxamine units linked to the cyclodextrins in these previous cases are rather 
ﬂ exibly attached, and do not perhaps have the optimum deﬁ ned geometry. Thus we pre-
pared a new series of compounds in which a pyridoxamine unit carried two sulfurs in a 
well - deﬁ ned geometry so that they could link to the A and B primary carbons of   β -
 cyclodextrin, using the same mechanism by which we had originally made the 6A, 6B 
bisimidazole cyclodextrin. With the new pyridoxamines we observed very high selectivi-
ties for hydrophobic substrates, and excellent control of their detailed geometries. 76 
 In a full paper we described detailed studies of our various approaches to chiral induc-
tion in the amino acid products of transaminations.  77   In that paper we also pointed out 
the odd fact that the Tabushi laboratory had reported the use of large concentrations of 
buffer in their reaction, which would have been expected to interfere with the selective 
proton transfer by an internal catalytic group if the buffer itself could start playing the 
role of protonating catalyst. 
 In our subsequent work we studied compounds in which a pyridoxamine was attached 
to C - 6 of  β - cyclodextrin and an imidazole unit was attached to C - 6 of the neighbouring 
glucose residue.  78   The two isomers are diastereomers, reﬂ ecting the chirality of their 
attachment and the chirality of the glucose units. We found that we could in fact get a 
reversal of the optical induction reﬂ ecting the different geometry of these two enantiom-
ers. Interestingly, we found that the imidazole as placed did not catalyse selective proton 
transfer, but instead performed a selective blocking of one face of the reaction intermedi-
ate so that protonation by the medium occurred on the side away from the imidazole ring. 
It was in this paper that we also reported the re - examination of the Tabushi case and our 
ﬁ nding that his isomers showed little enantioselectivity, unrelated to the position of the 
so - called protonating group.

instance, and in some interesting rearrangements of amino acids. Thus we examined a 
pyridoxal unit attached to   β  - cyclodextrin to see whether we could imitate the substrate 
binding and reactions involved in such pyridoxal catalysis. Pyridoxal catalyses the con-
densation of serine with indole to produce tryptophan, by a process in which the imine 
formed between pyridoxal and serine dehydrates to form a double bond to which the 
indole adds. We thought it likely that we could bind the indole into the cyclodextrin cavity 
and have it couple with the species that pyridoxal forms. We found that indeed this catalyst 
could couple d,l -   β  - chloroalanine to indole, in which the imine formed between pyridoxal 
and this alanine derivative eliminated HCl to form the unsaturated intermediate that reacts 
with indole to form tryptophan.  79   The results indicated some cooperativity in the process, 
but it was not very effective. 
 Pyridoxal phosphate is also the catalyst for the process by which glycine and for-
maldehyde are reversibly condensed in an aldol reaction to form serine. In a system 
that did not involve substrate binding with cyclodextrins we were able to show that we 
could duplicate that process, and that with sufﬁ cient geometric control we could obtain 
reasonable optical selectivity.  80   We also examined transamination in which the group 
that bound the substrate was a polyamine with a hydrophobic core, rather than a cyclo-
dextrin. 81  With this system we saw that we could reverse the transamination process 
 –  in the sense of converting the pyridoxal derivate back to pyridoxamine  –  by using a 
sacriﬁ cial  α - methyl amino acid that would undergo irreversible decarboxylation and 
transamination to afford the pyridoxamine and a ketone derived from the original sac-
riﬁ cial amino acid. 82 
 2.7  Mimics of Enzymes that Use Thiamine Pyrophosphate 
as a Co - Enzyme 
 Thiamine pyrophosphate ( 13 ) is the co - factor for a number of enzymes that can be 
described as stabilizing hypothetical acyl anion intermediates. For instance, it is the co -
 enzyme for the enzyme carboxylase that catalyses the conversion of pyruvic acid to 
acetaldehyde. We had early shown that this mechanism involves a thiazolium anion ( 14 ) 
whose second resonance form ( 15 ) is a carbene.  83   Ionization of the C - 2 proton of the thia-
zolium ring generates this species that can add nucleophilically to carbonyl groups such 
as that in pyruvic acid, forming an intermediate whose decarboxylation generates a sta-
bilized anion.

 In early studies of this chemistry we had examined the ability of such thiazolium 
salts to catalyse the benzoin condensation, a process which also formally involves an 
acyl anion but which is really of course the anion in which the thiazolium salt has 
been added to the carbonyl group (Figure  2.10 ). In this sense the thiazolium anion 
is very much like cyanide anion, the normal catalyst for simple benzoin condensa-
tions. Benzaldehyde would be expected to bind into a   β - cyclodextrin cavity, so we 
attached a thiazolium salt to a primary carbon of   β  - cyclodextrin and examined it as 
a catalyst. 84 We found that this was not a better catalyst for the benzoin condensation, 
apparently because there was no room in the   β  - cyclodextrin cavity for the binding 
of two benzaldehyde molecules. However it was clear that at least the reaction inter-
mediate was being formed; we got very rapid tritium exchange from the aldehyde 
by formation of the thiazolium adduct, and as well a very rapid oxidation of  para -
 t  - butyl benzaldehyde by ferricyanide ion since it was able to oxidize the reaction 
intermediate formed when the bound  t  - butyl benzaldehyde underwent addition of the 
thiazolium ring. 
 We then prepared essentially the same compound but based it on   γ - cyclodextrin, the 
molecule with eight glucose residues that has a cavity large enough to hold two ben-
zaldehyde groups.  85   This gave a 7 - fold to 9 - fold acceleration of the formation of benzoin 
relative to a simple thiazolium salt without the attached   γ - cyclodextrin binding group. 
In subsequent work we have shown that in this system the use of the polyamine with 
a hydrophobic core as a catalyst has led to even larger rate accelerations, up to 
2000 - fold.

 2.8  Aldol Condensations Catalysed by Cyclodextrin Derivatives 
 We prepared a series of catalysts with relatively simple groups attached to a cyclodextrin 
that would be able to catalyse an aldol condensation between acetone and some bound 
aromatic aldehydes, when the acetone formed an enamine with a catalytic group such as 
a simple amine.  86   We observed catalyses as high as 270 - fold relative to the uncatalysed 
aldol condensation with some of these cyclodextrin derivatives. 
 We also took advantage of our synthesis of three isomers of   β - cyclodextrin  bis - 
imidazoles  –  those with the imidazoles on neighboring glucose units (AB), with one 
intervening glucose unit (AC) and with two intervening glucoses (AD)  –  to examine the 
detailed geometry involved in the enolization of ketones, in which a proton is removed 
from an  α  carbon by a general base while another proton is added to the carbonyl 
oxygen by a general acid. We examined the rate of exchange of the methyl group of  p -
 t  - butylacetophenone with deuterium in D 2 O catalysed by these three  bis - imidazole isomers 
and by  β - cyclodextrin 6 - monotosylate. 87 
 The best catalyst was the AD isomer, the reverse of what we had seen in our ribonu-
clease model studies. The pH/rate proﬁ le indicated that there was bifunctional catalysis 
by imidazole and imidazolium groups. This indicated that proton removal has a prefer-
ential direction of attack by base that is not directly along the C - H bond line, but instead 
pushes the electrons toward the carbonyl group (Figure  2.11 ). Such subtle information is 
available only because of the deﬁ ned geometry in molecular complexes of cyclodextrin 
 bis - imidazoles.

 Subsequently we used the   β - cyclodextrin  bis  - imidazoles to perform aldol condensa-
tions. In our ﬁ rst such study we examined the aldol condensation of ketoaldehyde  16 . 88 
We saw that the best catalyst for this process was again the AD isomer of the  bis - 
imidazole, but there were some special features. First of all, the catalyst promoted deu-
terium exchange into the CH 2  next to the ketone group, so enolization was reversible and 
the addition of this enol to the aldehyde group was rate determining. Thus the bifunctional 
catalyst not only speeded the enolization to the point at which it was reversible and not 
rate - determining, it also catalysed the addition of the enol to the aldehyde group. 
Furthermore, the catalyst reversed the selectivity of enolization, promoting enolization 
next to the accessible keto group even more rapidly than next to the normally more reac-
tive aldehyde group. 
 We also examined aldol condensations of the dialdehyde  17 . 89 Without the special 
catalysis afforded by the cyclodextrin  bis - imidazoles there was an almost random reaction 
to form compounds  18  and  19 , as either aldehyde acted as the enolizing group. However, 
the cyclodextrin imidazole catalysts directed the selective formation of products  19 , with 
no selectivity among its stereoisomers. Interestingly, the least selective catalyst for  17 
was the cyclodextrin mono - imidazole, the AD isomer of the  bis - imidazole was more 
selective, and the most selective was the AB isomer. Obviously these results indicate that 
the cyclodextrin imidazole catalysts promote enolization of the aldehyde group closest to 
the cyclodextrin, as expected, but the subtlety of preferences among the  bis - imidazole 
isomers is not yet understood in this case.

 2.9  Mimics of Enzymes Using Coenzyme B 12 as a Cofactor 
 Coenzyme B 12 is involved in some remarkable catalytic processes, including in particular 
the reversible conversion of a succinic acid derivative to a methylmalonyl derivative 
and the reversible conversion of   β  - methylaspartic acid to glutamic acid. In these reac-
tions vitamin B 12  is covalently linked at its cobalt atom with an adenosine group, and 
the catalytic chemistry involves dissociation of the carbon - cobalt bond and subsequent 
reactions promoted by the resulting adenosyl radical. In our ﬁ rst study we synthesized 
a compound ( 20 ) in which the cobalt of B 12  is covalently linked to one of the primary 
methylene groups of cyclodextrin.  90   We saw that the carbon - cobalt bond easily dissoci-
ated to form a cyclodextrinyl radical. This could then form a substrate radical by group 
transfer from a substrate bound in the cyclodextrin cavity, although not yet by hydrogen 
transfer. 
 
20
Co(B12)
 
 In a subsequent paper we linked B 12  to the cyclodextrin not with a carbon – cobalt bond 
but with a bond to one of the B 12  side chains.  91   We examined the rearrangement and reac-
tion of a substrate that could bind into the cyclodextrin cavity, and for which the B 12 
component could initiate a free radical process with a rearrangement related to those one 
sees in the biochemical processes. Some such preference was seen for the binding sub-
strate compared to the non - binding substrate, indicating that this was a promising begin-
ning to an interesting approach to B 12 mimics. 
 2.10  Mimics of Cytochrome P - 450 
 Cytochrome P - 450 describes a group of enzymes that use a heme group to perform oxida-
tions, including in particular oxidations of carbon - hydrogen bonds. Many model systems 
had been examined for such processes, but they had not included any deﬁ ned binding of 
a substrate in such a way as to achieve pre - selected functionalization of particular carbon 
atoms. Thus we initiated a series of studies of such systems in which we used cyclodex-
trins as binding groups for the substrates to hold them, in water, in such a position as to 
achieve selective functionalizations. 
 In general we used steroids as the substrates. They are rigid and make it easier to 
achieve selectivity without concern about the substrate conformation, and the selective 
oxidation of steroids in particular positions is actually of practical interest. Currently there 
are steroid hormones that are produced by biochemical oxidation using the enzymes 
P - 450, but we wished to produce mimics that would not have the disadvantage of enzy-
matic reactions  –  with their problems in dealing with proteins and fermentation.

Cytochrome P - 450 models are generally used to insert an oxygen atom into either a double 
bond or a carbon - hydrogen bond, although we also demonstrated that such a model could 
insert nitrogen atoms instead, producing interesting and selective ways of synthesizing 
quite useful compounds.  92   We also showed that such nitrogen insertion can be done by 
the actual biological enzyme itself under some conditions.  93 
 We synthesized metalloporphyrins ( 21 ) carrying four   β - cyclodextrin rings attached to 
phenyl groups on the meso carbons of the porphyrin, and examined their use for selective 
oxidations. In our ﬁ rst work we used this system, as its manganese complex, to insert 
oxygens into double bonds of substrate that could doubly bind to cyclodextrins across the 
center of the porphyrin ring.  94   We saw quite good selectivity. As oxidant we use iodoso-
benzene as an oxygen transfer species, putting the oxygen on the manganese which then 
transferred it to the substrate. We also added a coordinating bulky carboxylic acid to the 
system so that it would bind to one face of the manganese, and direct both the substrate 
and the oxygen to the other face.

 We then used this same manganese porphyrin system carrying four   β - cyclodextrins to 
perform the hydroxylation of a saturated carbon in a steroid substrate.  95,96 The steroid ( 22 ) 
had binding groups attached to positions 3 and 17 in rings A and D, so it could dissolve 
in water and use these binding groups to insert into cyclodextrins on opposite sides of 
the porphyrin system. The catalyst was remarkably selective, inserting oxygen only into 
C - 6 of the steroid to make a steroidal alcohol ( 23 ). Furthermore, this alcohol was not 
further oxidized to a carbonyl group, which would normally be an easier oxidation than 
the insertion into a C – H bond. However, molecular models indicated that we could insert 
into the   α  - face of the steroid generating the   α  C - 6 alcohol, but that we could not reach 
the axial  β  - hydrogen on that carbon. Apparently the oxidation of such alcohols to ketones 
by this oxidation class occurs by hydrogen abstraction from the carbinol carbon, and that 
is geometrically impossible in this case.

 One problem with our system was that the catalyst itself was oxidized fairly easily, so 
we did not get many catalytic turnovers. Others working on cytochrome models had 
shown that the catalyst was much more oxidatively stable when the phenyl rings were 
perﬂ uorinated. Thus we synthesized a perﬂ uorinated version ( 24 ) of our previous com-
pound, easily prepared from the porphyrin with four pentaﬂ uorophenyl groups by simple 
reaction with   β - cyclodextrin 6 - thiol, which selectively replaced the  para ﬂ uorines in the 
phenyl rings.  97   While with the previous catalyst we only achieved three to ﬁ ve turnovers 
before the catalyst was destroyed, the new ﬂ uorinated catalyst performed the same selec-
tive hydroxylation of C - 6 in the steroid with 187 turnovers.

 The selective hydroxylation at C - 6 of an androstane ring was striking, but not neces-
sarily the most desired target. We really wanted to functionalize either C - 9 or C - 11 in 
order to be able to convert a simple steroid to a corticosteroid, a process that is currently 
performed by biological fermentation. Models indicated that if we could get triple binding 
of a steroid derivative with binding groups at carbons 3, 6 and 17, the hydrogen on carbon 
9 would be in reach of the oxygen atom on the manganese, so we examined this system.

We synthesized the substrate ( 25 ) using the C - 6 hydroxyl group that we had previously 
inserted, and performed its oxidation with our ﬂ uorinated catalyst. Indeed we saw that 
the result was the product  26  with the selective hydroxylation of C - 9  –  in line with 
molecular models indicating that the preferred geometry of the catalyst/substrate complex 
put the hydrogen at C - 9 in van der Waals contact with the oxygen on the manganese 
atom. 98   We described these studies in more detail and indicated that in some cases as 
many as 3,000 catalytic turnovers were achieved. 99

 Models suggested that we could achieve the desired hydroxylation at C - 9 using only 
two binding groups at carbons 3 and 6 of the steroid, but when this was tried with our 
original catalyst we saw that we obtained not only hydroxylation at C - 9 but also some 
hydroxylation at C - 15. This indicated that we had to adjust the geometry of the complex 
a bit by using a related molecule in which the cyclodextrins were attached to the meta 
positions of the phenyls in the porphyrin, not the  para  positions. To achieve the same 
geometry with an easier synthesis we prepared the porphyrin carrying tetraﬂ uoropyridine 
rings instead of phenyl rings. The cyclodextrins were then attached by substitution next 
to the nitrogen of the pyridine ring, achieving the desired geometry. We found that with 
new catalyst  27  we were able to achieve selective hydroxylation of C - 9 starting with 
oxygens only at C - 3 and C - 6 of the steroid in a doubly bound  –  not triply bound  – 
complex. 100   The entire system was described further in a full paper summarizing the work 
with iodosobenzene as an oxidant and porphyrins carrying four   β - cyclodextrin units as 
the catalyst. 101

oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or potassium persulfate. Such oxidants had been used 
previously in oxidations by metalloporphyrins, but not in an aqueous system. However 
we needed the water system both because we were interested in mimicking such aqueous 
chemistry and also because we needed the hydrophobic binding of the substrates into the 
catalyst cyclodextrin units. In the actual enzyme there is a thiol ligand coordinated to the 
iron in the porphyrin ring, and other work suggested that a thiol ligand as the thiolate 
anion made the porphyrin system a stronger reducing agent able to accept oxygen from 
simpler oxygen donor species. Thus we synthesized a system in which we coordinated a 
phenylthiolate anion to the manganese of the porphyrin and saw that we were able to use 
hydrogen peroxide as the effective oxidant in our water system.  102   We did this in two 
ways. 
 In one approach we synthesized a compound with a covalently linked bridge across 
the porphyrin carrying the phenyl thiol group, and with two cyclodextrins on the other 
two positions. In the other approach we synthesized a phenylthiol derivative with two 
linkers to binding groups, and used it with our original ﬂ uorinated porphyrin. It bound to 
two cyclodextrins on one face of the porphyrin, while the substrate bound to the other 
two cyclodextrins. This is much like the enzyme in which the thiol comes from a cysteine 
of the protein, not from a covalent link to the porphyrin. In both cases we saw that we 
could now use hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant for our selective C - 6 hydroxylation. 
Thus a major problem in the previous work  –  the use of an expensive oxidant  – was 
solved.

Cyclodextrins as Molecular Reactors  
 Christopher J.  Easton and  Hideki  Onagi 
 Research School of Chemistry, Australian National University, Canberra ACT 0200, Australia 
 3.1  Introduction 
 Cyclodextrins have been known for more than a century  1   and throughout that time they 
have been the subjects of continuous study, due mainly to their ability to act as molecular 
hosts and form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic guests in aqueous solution (Figure 
 3.1 ). 2   In recent decades these investigations have culminated in numerous applications of 
cyclodextrins in the pharmaceutical industry, as food additives, and in cosmetics and other 
personal care and household products.  3   One theme of our interest in these compounds, 
which is the subject of this chapter, has been their use as molecular reactors. 4 Like the 
other applications, this depends on the formation of inclusion complexes. In this particular 
case, the cyclodextrins are used as miniature reaction vessels and their tendency to form 
inclusion complexes is exploited to manipulate the assembly of reagents in the vessels in 
order to affect the outcomes of chemical transformations at the molecular level. In this 
regard the cyclodextrins are quite similar to the large scale vats and chemical reactors 
used for industrial chemical processing, beakers and ﬂ asks used in laboratory syntheses, 
and pots and saucepans used to prepare food  –  they are simply vessels for chemical reac-
tions. However, the important distinction is that only the molecular containers provide a 
means by which the individual chemical processes may be regulated. Where a variety of

different chemical reactions would take place in bulk media, molecular reactors provide 
a means to favour one or a particular combination. 
 This behaviour is in many ways like that displayed by enzymes and other authors have 
therefore used the term artiﬁ cial enzymes instead of molecular reactors.  5 However, the 
need for a different term has become more important since recent rapid advances in 
molecular biology have provided tools for protein engineering to produce entirely new 
catalysts that might be more obviously classed as artiﬁ cial enzymes, while molecular 
reactors encompass a much broader range of species. Another important distinction is

that while enzymes achieve their effects because they are catalysts and enhance reaction 
rates, molecular reactors frequently bias the balance between various chemical reactions 
to affect the overall outcome by slowing down reactions, but selectively to a greater or 
lesser extent. That is, a molecular reactor may accomplish a particular result either by 
enhancing the rate of a desired process or by decreasing the rate of an undesired one. 
 The molecular reactor concept is common to many parts of this volume, which describe 
a wide variety of such reaction vessels. Many groups other than ours have studied cyclo-
dextrins and other chapters, especially those by Breslow and Takahashi, also deal with 
their application in this context. This chapter is therefore focussed on our particular per-
spective and illustrated mainly with examples from our own laboratories. Much of our 
work has involved modiﬁ ed cyclodextrins 2   because these provide a greater range of 
functional groups and corresponding chemistry, and more opportunities to template reac-
tion geometries, but it would be inappropriate not to acknowledge the related pioneering 
work with the natural cyclodextrins that was carried out by the research groups of 
Cramer, 6 Bender, 7 and others, to provide the essential foundations of this ﬁ eld. 
 3.2  Regiocontrolled Electrophilic Aromatic Substitutions 
 The most straightforward examples of cyclodextrin molecular reactors are probably those 
that involve a change in the regioselectivity of a reaction, as a result of a substrate being 
included in a cyclodextrin in such a way as to restrict or control the geometry of access 
of a reagent. Breslow  et al ., 8,9   in particular have developed this approach to substituting 
hydrogen for functional groups in both aliphatic and aromatic compounds. In an illustra-
tive example we developed,  10   but which is derivative of related aromatic chlorinations,  8,11 
bromination of acetanilide with pyridinium dichlorobromate in water at room temperature 
gave a 56   :   44 ratio of the corresponding  ortho - and  para - substituted monobromides in 
the absence of a cyclodextrin, but that ratio changed to 79  :  21 when   β - cyclodextrin was 
added and, within the limits of detection, only the  para - isomer was produced in the pres-
ence of   α  - cyclodextrin (Figure  3.2 a). It appears that acetanilide includes in the cyclodex-
trins with an orientation that shields the  ortho  - positions, but leaves the  para - position 
exposed to attack by the brominating agent. The beneﬁ t provided by the cyclodextrins in 
the synthesis of  para  - bromoacetanilide is not just to increase the yield, even though with 
 α  - cyclodextrin this is almost doubled. Particularly for reactions carried out on a large 
scale, it is also relevant that less  ortho - substituted by - product is formed, reducing waste 
and simplifying product isolation by obviating fractional crystallisation or chromatogra-
phy. There are several other advantageous features of this system common to many 
involving cyclodextrins: the processes occur in water, which is attractive as an environ-
mentally benign solvent; the cyclodextrins substantially increase the solubility of the 
substrate in water, thereby reducing reaction volumes; and an aqueous solution of the 
cyclodextrin can be reused repeatedly in a batch - type process whereby the substrate and 
reagent are added and, after reaction, the products are separated by extraction, to leave 
the cyclodextrin solution which can be recycled.   
 The effect of the cyclodextrins on the regioselectivity of bromination of anisole is 
similar to that seen with acetanilide (Figure  3.2 b). With systems more activated to elec-
trophilic substitution, such as 3 - methylacetanilide and 3 - methylanisole, the cyclodextrins

also limit the extent of further bromination of the 4 - bromosubstituted initial product 
(Figure  3.2 c). For example, under conditions where treatment of 3 - methylanisole with 
1.1 equivalents of the brominating reagent afforded starting material and the 4 - , 2,4 - , 
4,6 - and 2,4,6 - substituted products in the ratio 23  :  37  :  19  :  20  :  1, addition of   α - cyclodextrin 
changed this ratio to 12  :  46  :  18  :  21  :  1, while in the presence of   β - cyclodextrin only the 
starting material and the 4 - , 2,4 -  and 4,6 - substituted products were detected, in the ratio 
4  :  86  :  5  :  5. Thus   β - cyclodextrin increases the yield of 4 - bromo - 3 - methylanisole from 37 
to 86% and proportionately decreases the amount of by - products from 63 to 14%. 
 The choice of which cyclodextrin is best to use to achieve a particular outcome is 
difﬁ cult to predict. It depends on a number of factors such as the extent of inclusion of 
substrates, reagents and products, that can be calculated from the association constants 
of the various inclusion complexes, but also on the orientation of inclusion and the effect 
of the cyclodextrin on reaction intermediates and the geometry of interactions between 
substrates and reagents, which are not easily determined. Interestingly,   α - cyclodextrin 
was more effective than   β  - cyclodextrin in controlling the bromination of acetanilide and 
anisole, while the opposite was seen with the corresponding reactions of the 3 - methyl -
 substituted substrates. In some cases a more signiﬁ cant effect is achieved with a modiﬁ ed 
cyclodextrin. For example, the bromination of 3 - phenylpropanoic acid gave the  para - and 
 ortho  - monobromides in the ratio 64   :   36 in the absence of a cyclodextrin, and in the ratios 
62  :  38 and 69  :  31 in the presence of   β - and   α  - cyclodextrin, respectively, but using the 
same concentration of the amino cyclodextrin derivative having an amino substituent in 
place of a primary hydroxyl group, only 3 - (4 - bromophenyl)propanoic acid was produced 
(Figure  3.2 d). 12   The substantially greater effect of the modiﬁ ed cyclodextrin in this system 
can be attributed to an ionic interaction between the amino group of the host and the 
carboxyl group of the guest, that are both ionised under the neutral experimental condi-
tions, to stabilise the inclusion complex and control the alignment of the host within the 
guest (Figure  3.2 e). 
 3.3  Catalysis of Hydrolytic Reactions 
 Some of the earliest examples of cyclodextrin molecular reactors involved their use as 
catalysts for hydrolysis of carboxylic acid derivatives, as demonstrated by Bender and 
co - workers 13   with phenyl esters and the natural cyclodextrins, in the original papers in 
this area. The reactions involve transient acylation of the cyclodextrin similar to that seen 
with serine and cysteine proteases. They exhibit kinetic characteristics, such as substrate 
saturation, non - productive binding and competitive inhibition, which are reminiscent of 
enzyme - catalysed processes. In addition, the discrimination displayed by cyclodextrins 
in binding guests and promoting their reactions is analogous to the substrate selectivity 
displayed by enzymes. One form of this type of substrate selectivity displayed by the 
cyclodextrins is chiral discrimination 14 and, for example,   β - cyclodextrin reacts diastere-
oselectively with the ( R ) - enantiomer of the acid chloride of the non - steroidal anti - 
inﬂ ammatory drug Ibuprofen (Figure  3.3 ).  15   The cyclodextrin ester formed through this 
acylation undergoes subsequent hydrolysis to release the drug, and the stereoselectivity 
of the hydrolysis is complementary to that of the acylation, also favouring reaction of the 
diastereomer derived from ( R ) - Ibuprofen. For the combined synthesis and hydrolysis of

Molecular Encapsulation
the cyclodextrin ester, the overall chiral discrimination in favour of the ( R ) - enantiomer 
is a factor of approximately ﬁ fty. 
 With the natural cyclodextrins, hydroxyl groups are the only functionality available to 
promote reactions of included guests. However, the introduction of a diverse range of 
new functional groups through modiﬁ cation of the natural cyclodextrins has resulted in 
catalysts that mimic the entire range of enzyme behaviour. In one particular example, 
Breslow  et al ., 16 constructed a series of bis - imidazole - substituted   β - cyclodextrins that 
catalyse the hydrolysis of 4 - tert - butylcatechol cyclic phosphate. With the 6 A ,6 B -
 disubstituted cyclodextrin, which has imidazole groups in place of the primary hydroxyl 
groups of two adjacent glucopyranose residues, there is good evidence that the reaction 
involves simultaneous bifunctional acid - base catalysis, where one imidazole ring acts as 
a base and the other, which is protonated and therefore present as the imidazolium ion, 
acts as an acid. In this case the controlled alignment of both functional groups and the 
cyclodextrin annulus optimises the geometry for binding and reaction of the included 
substrate. 
 The hydrolysis of organophosphate triesters is a particular challenge that is of interest 
in the remediation of soils and waters contaminated by insecticides of this type, and in 
the destruction of related chemical warfare agents. The natural and most modiﬁ ed cyclo-

dextrins either inhibit or only modestly accelerate breakdown of these phosphates in 
aqueous solution. However, the copper complexes of the   β - cyclodextrin derivatives with 
2 - aminoethylamino and 3 - aminopropylamino groups in place of one of the primary 
hydroxyl substituents efﬁ ciently catalyse the hydrolysis of 4 -  tert - butyl - 2 - nitrophenyl 
dimethyl phosphate at pH 7.0, increasing the rate of reaction of the cyclodextrin - bound 
species by more than 95,000 and 70,000 times, respectively (Figure  3.4 ).  17 The metal-
locyclodextrins are substrate selective and behave as true catalysts, in that there is multiple 
turnover of the triester. The reaction is most probably brought about by metal - bound 
hydroxide. Water bound to copper in the complex of the aminopropylamino - substituted 
cyclodextrin has a p K a of 7.84. 
 3.4  A Molecular Reactor for the Synthesis of Indigoid Dyes 
 In addition to molecular reactors that affect both the regioselectivity of introduction and 
rates of interconversion of functional groups, others have been developed to control the 
outcomes of carbon - carbon bond forming reactions. In this area, one of the systems that 
we have studied in some detail involves the use of a cyclodextrin dimer to template the 
synthesis of indirubin.  18,19   While this dye is of considerable interest in its own right,  18 it 
is most commonly known as a by - product of the formation of indigo, the compound used 
to colour denim. Indirubin has a ruby red colour and the presence of this material in indigo 
or indigo - treated denim results in a pinkish - purple tinge often associated with low quality. 
 Indoxyl, which is readily obtained by hydrolysis of indoxyl acetate, gives indigo 
through oxidative dimerisation, but competitive oxidation of indoxyl affords isatin, that 
also reacts with indoxyl to give indirubin (Figure  3.5 ). To bias these competing processes 
in favour of indirubin production, a dimer comprised of two   β - cyclodextrins joined by 
substituting a primary hydroxyl group of each one with a urea linkage was used as a

template. In principle such a template could have been chosen based on its ability to 
selectively bind the desired product but that was not possible to determine in this case, 
due to the very low solubility of both indirubin and indigo in water. Instead, the cyclo-
dextrin dimer was selected because it showed particularly strong binding of Tropaeolin 
000 No. 2, a water - soluble dye similar in shape to indirubin. The expectation was then 
that since the binding of the Tropaeolin showed the dimer readily adopted the shape of 
indirubin, it would complex both indoxyl and isatin in the orientation to form indirubin 
(Figure  3.6 ), but less readily include two molecules of indoxyl aligned to form indigo. In 
the event, under conditions in which isatin and indoxyl derived from indoxyl acetate 
reacted in the absence of a cyclodextrin to give indigo and indirubin in yields of 16 and 
13%, respectively, the corresponding yields of the dyes formed in the presence of the 
urea - linked cyclodextrin dimer were 0.03 and 1.0% (Table  3.1 ). The cyclodextrin dimer 
changed the ratio of production of the dyes by a factor of more than forty, in favour of 
indirubin.   β - Cyclodextrin and   β  - cyclodextrin dimers joined by oxalamide and succina-
mide groups also reduced the yields of both dyes but did not show the same bias towards 
indirubin formation.     
 The problem with this system is that the molecular reactor offers very little in the way 
of a real practical advantage! The ratio of formation of the dyes has been changed in 
favour of indirubin but only by reducing the overall yield of the two dyes by a factor of 
almost thirty and the yield of indirubin by thirteen times. This is almost certainly the 
result of complexation of indoxyl and isatin by the cyclodextrin, increasing their effective 
steric bulk and reducing the frequency of their productive collisions. At the same time 
the rates of hydrolytic decomposition of indoxyl and isatin are largely unaffected, so these 
processes become more dominant. Similar effects are likely to be common with molecular 
reactors unless complexation increases the desired reactivity in some other way.

 In the present case, this was accomplished with isatin - 5 - sulfonate instead of isatin, 
using the urea - linked cyclodextrin dimer to alter the ratio of formation of indigo, through 
oxidative dimerisation of indoxyl, to indirubin - 5 ′  - sulfonate, from indoxyl and the isatin-
sulfonate (Figure  3.5 ). The isatinsulfonate exists in solution in equilibrium with its 
hydrate, which deprotonates with a p K a  of 9.55 to give the corresponding anion

(Figure  3.7 ). Neither the hydrate nor the anion reacts with indoxyl. Complexation by a 
cyclodextrin decreases the extent of hydration of the isatinsulfonate and increases the p K a 
of the hydrate to above 10.0. For the condensation reaction carried out at pH 10.0, the 
cyclodextrin therefore substantially increases the percentage of the isatinsulfonate present 
at equilibrium in the neutral, non - hydrated, reactive form. Accordingly, under conditions 
in which indigo and indirubin - 5 ′  - sulfonate are formed in yields of 25 and 1.4%, respec-
tively, in the absence of a cyclodextrin, addition of the urea - linked cyclodextrin dimer 
results in a 22% yield of the indirubin and no indigo was formed within the limits of 
detection ( < 0.1%) (Table  3.1 ). Consequently the molecular reactor changes the ratio of 
formation of the dyes by a factor of more than three and a half thousand, with very little 
loss of yield. In this case   β - cyclodextrin and the dimers joined by oxalamide and succi-
namide groups also favour formation of the indirubinsulfonate by factors of approxi-
mately one hundred, ﬁ fty and three hundred, respectively, because their complexation of 
the isatinsulfonate also increases its reactivity, but their effects are less than those seen 
with the urea dimer because they do not simultaneously template the interaction between 
the sulfonate and indoxyl. 
 3.5  Manipulation of Cycloadditions 
 Cyclodextrins have also been studied as molecular reactors for cycloadditions. To some 
extent reactions of this class are obvious candidates for such investigations since they are 
generally solvent - independent, non - catalysed processes, and factors such as reaction rates 
and regio -  and stereo - selectivity are only affected by the concentrations of the reacting 
species and how those align to react. Through inclusion of the reactants in a cyclodextrin, 
their effective local concentrations can be increased and their relative alignment can be 
altered, to increase the reaction rates and change the product ratios.   β - Cyclodextrin has 
been found to alter the diastereoselectivity of Diels – Alder reactions of cyclopentadiene 
with maleic and fumaric acid derivatives,  20   and accelerate the rates of such reactions by 
factors ranging from ﬁ fteen to more than seven thousand.  21   Different natural cyclodextrins

 cyclodextrin produces the isomeric ( Z ) - stilbene, which undergoes electrocyclisation and 
oxidation to the corresponding phenanthrene, the analogous photolysis performed instead 
in the presence of   γ  - cyclodextrin gives only the [2+2] - cycloaddition products (Figure 
 3.8 ). 22 The difference reﬂ ects the formation of a 1   :   1 host - guest inclusion complex of the 
stilbene with   β - cyclodextrin compared with a 1  :  2 complex with   γ - cyclodextrin. 
 The effects of cyclodextrins on [4+4] - photodimerizations of anthracene derivatives 
have been studied quite extensively.  23,24   For example, it has been found that such reactions 
of anthracene - 2 - sulfonate and  - 2 - carboxylate in water are accelerated by both   β - and 
 γ - cyclodextrin.   γ  - Cyclodextrin has very little effect on the ratio of the four possible 
cycloadducts but, with each of the anthracene derivatives,   β - cyclodextrin increases the 
proportion of the  anti  - head - to - tail cycloadduct from less than 45% to more than 85% 
(Figure  3.9 ). 23 The effects observed with the natural cyclodextrins generally arise from 
the fortuitous way the reagents self - assemble in the cyclodextrin annulus. By comparison, 
modiﬁ ed cyclodextrins offer the additional beneﬁ t of providing a means to control the

assembly of the reacting species, so as to manipulate the outcomes of cycloadditions by 
design. Accordingly, bispyridinio - appended and capped   γ - cyclodextrin derivatives have 
been identiﬁ ed that induce a two -  to ﬁ ve - fold increase in the proportion of the  anti - head -
 to - head cycloadduct formed from anthracene - 2 - carboxylate. 24   They also afford that dimer 
with enantiomeric excesses as high as 35% and there seems to be a general correlation 
between the yield and enantiomeric excess obtained using a particular cyclodextrin 
derivative.   
 We have exploited modiﬁ ed cyclodextrins to reverse the regioselectivity of [3+2] -
 dipolar cycloadditions. Nitrile oxides (dipoles) undergo dipolar cycloadditions with 
alkynes and alkenes (dipolarophiles) to give isoxazoles and isoxazolines (cycloadducts), 
respectively. With monosubstituted dipolarophiles, in principle both 3,4 -  and 3,5 - 
disubstituted cycloadducts could form but, in practice, the reactions generally produce 
mainly the 3,5 - disubstituted - ring system (Figure  3.10 ). 25   Steric effects determine the 
regioselectivity, with the more hindered end of the dipolarophile bonding preferentially 
to the oxygen of the nitrile oxide. For example, the reaction of 4 -  tert - butylbenzonitrile 
oxide with propynamide in water at room temperature produces the corresponding 3,5 - 
and 3,4 - disubstituted isoxazoles in the ratio 4   :   1. However,   β  - cyclodextrin can act as a 
molecular scaffold to change the outcome. By attaching propynamide to the cyclodextrin 
through substitution of one of its primary hydroxy that is should be hydroxyl groups, 
reaction with the nitrile oxide then affords the 3,5 -  and 3,4 - cycloadducts in the ratio 1   :   15 
(Figure  3.11 ). 26   Whereas 80% of the 3,5 - disubstituted species is produced in the absence 
of the cyclodextrin, more than 90% of the opposite regioisomer is formed when it is 
present. This is consistent with the formation of an inclusion complex between the nitrile 
oxide and the modiﬁ ed cyclodextrin, in which the relative orientations of the dipole and 
dipolarophile are controlled (Figure  3.12 ). The importance of this inclusion to the reaction 
outcome is highlighted by the observation that the effect of the cyclodextrin is much less 
both when the reactions are carried out in  N , N  - dimethylformamide instead of water, where 
the extent of host – guest complexation is much less, and in water with nitrile oxides other 
than the  tert  - butylbenzo derivative, that are less hydrophobic and less inclined to include.   
 Similar effects have been observed with azide dipolar cycloadditions.  27   In the system 
directly analogous to that described in the preceding paragraph, reaction of 4 -  tert - 
butylphenylazide with propynamide produces a 2  :  1 ratio of the 1,4 - and 1,5 - disubstituted -
 1,2,3 - triazoles, whereas tethering the propynamide to   β - cyclodextrin changes the ratio

of the corresponding cycloadducts to 1   :   25 (Figure  3.13 ). That is, while 67% of the 
1,4 - disubstituted species is produced in the absence of the cyclodextrin, more than 95% 
of the opposite regioisomer is formed when the cyclodextrin is present. Either the dipo-
larophile or the dipole may be attached to the cyclodextrin to affect the regioselectivity. 
With the azido -   β  - cyclodextrin where azide is substituted for one of the primary hydroxyl 
groups, the reaction with  N - (4 - tert - butylphenyl)propynamide gave an 8  :  1 mixture of the 
1,4 -  and 1,5 - disubstituted triazoles, presumably through formation of a host - guest inclu-
sion complex of the reactants, but with  N - (3,5 - dimethylphenyl)propynamide, where the 
bulk of the aromatic group restricts complexation, the ratio was swapped to 1  :  6.

 Qualitatively, the cyclodextrin increases the rate of these cycloadditions as well as 
affecting the regioselectivity. The extent of reaction of 4 -  tert - butylphenylazide with pro-
pynamide in reﬂ uxing toluene after two days is less than that of the corresponding reaction 
of the cyclodextrin - substituted propynamide at room temperature in water after ﬁ fteen 
hours. A semi - quantitative analysis of this type of effect was performed in water using 
various nitrile oxides each at 1   mM concentration, in competing reactions with propyna-
mide (20   mM) and the cyclodextrin - substituted analogue (2   mM). Despite the use of a 
ten - fold excess of propynamide, benzo - , 4 - phenylbenzo - and 4 - tert - butylbenzo - nitrile 
oxide each reacts selectively with the cyclodextrin derivative, by factors of more than 
two, ﬁ fty and three hundred, respectively. This selective molecular recognition between 
alkynes by the nitrile oxides is complemented by a similar selection between nitrile oxides 
by the cyclodextrin - substituted alkyne. The cyclodextrin (25    µ M) shows a seventy ﬁ ve -
 fold selectivity for reaction with 4 -  tert - butylbenzonitrile oxide (50  µ M) in preference to 
benzonitrile oxide (500  µ M), despite the use of a ten - fold excess of the latter. 
 These trends correspond to pseudo - ﬁ rst order rate constants of 0.5    ×  10  − 3 , 2.0  ×  10  − 3 , 
 > 650  ×  10  − 3  and  > 30  ×  10  − 3  min  − 1  for production of the 3,4 -  and 3,5 - disubstituted isoxa-
zoles from reaction of 4 -  tert - butylbenzonitrile oxide (1  mM) with propynamide (5  mM) 
and the cyclodextrin derivative (5   mM), respectively (Figure  3.14 ). Thus, the cyclodextrin 
moiety increases the rate of formation of the 3,4 - disubstituted isoxazole by more than 
three orders of magnitude. Even the rate of formation of the 3,5 - disubstituted isoxazole 
is increased more than ﬁ fteen times by the cyclodextrin, despite templating of the 
other isomer being preferred. Under analogous conditions, the pseudo - ﬁ rst order rate 
constants for production of the 1,5 -  and 1,4 - disubstituted triazoles from reaction of 4 -  tert - 
butylphenylazide with propynamide and the cyclodextrin derivative are  < 0.1  ×  10  − 5 ,

 < 0.1  ×  10  − 5 , 40  ×  10  − 5  and 2    ×  10  − 5  min  − 1 , respectively (Figure  3.14 ). Therefore, in this 
case, the cyclodextrin moiety increases the rate of formation of the 1,5 - disubstituted tria-
zole by a factor of more than four hundred, and even the rate of formation of the 1,4 -
 isomer is accelerated by a factor of at least twenty. 
 The effects of   β  - cyclodextrin on the regioselectivity of cycloaddition reactions with 
alkynes are also seen with alkenes, as well as when the dipolarophiles are attached to the 
cyclodextrin through ester instead of amide linkages. Under conditions where 4 -  tert -
 butylbenzonitrile oxide reacts with methyl acrylate to give the corresponding 3,5 -  and 
3,4 - disubstituted isoxazolines in the ratio 20   :   1, the acrylate ester formed with   β -
 cyclodextrin through one of its primary hydroxyl groups produces the corresponding 
cycloadducts in the ratio 1   :   20. In this case the cyclodextrin changes isoxazoline formation 
from more than 95% of the 3,5 - disubstituted species to more than 95% of the alternative 
cycloadduct. Similar changes to the ratios of the cycloadducts are observed with the esters 
of  α - methylacrylic and crotonic acid.

 These reactions can be incorporated into a cycle where the cyclodextrin is used and 
then regenerated, although the effect of the cyclodextrin on the regioselectivity is some-
what reduced under these circumstances (Figure  3.15 ).  28   Accordingly, acylation of   β -
 cyclodextrin with 3 - nitrophenyl acrylate, in aqueous solution at pH 9.0 and room 
temperature for eight hours, gives the cyclodextrin acrylate, which undergoes cycloaddi-
tion with 4 - tert - butylbenzonitrile oxide. After a further hour at pH 12.0, to allow for ester 
hydrolysis, adjustment to pH 1.0 gives the 3,5 -  and 3,4 - disubstituted cycloadducts, which 
extract into organic solvent leaving the aqueous solution of the reformed cyclodextrin. 
The ratio of the 3,5 -  and 3,4 - disubstituted isoxazolines obtained in this way is 1   :   2, com-
pared with 20   :   1 from acrylic acid and 1   :   20 from the cyclodextrin acrylate. The inter-
mediate value indicates that not all of the reaction of the 3 - nitrophenyl ester proceeds 
through the cyclodextrin acrylate. 
 3.6  Conclusion 
 The examples described above are just a selection of those reported, chosen to illustrate 
what has already been achieved using cyclodextrin - based molecular reactors. The con-
cepts have been clearly demonstrated and it is reasonable to expect that practical applica-

tions will follow, once the methodology becomes accepted as a way to address particular 
types of problems faced in synthetic chemistry. Meanwhile, there remains a lot of scope 
to develop further methodology in the ﬁ eld. In the last few years entirely new applications 
of cyclodextrin molecular reactors have been developed, for example, in the ring - opening 
polymerisation of lactones,  29   while perhaps the most interesting and potentially important 
report in this area is of the ﬁ xation of nitrogen, through the use of a 1   :   2 complex of 
buckminsterfullerene (C 60 ) with   γ  - cyclodextrin (Figure  3.16 ) in aqueous sodium bisulﬁ te, 
irradiated under nitrogen at atmospheric pressure.  30   These reports indicate that molecular 
reactors, and artiﬁ cial enzymes as they were known earlier, still have considerable poten-
tial for further development and their study continues to be a fruitful area for research.

 4.1  Introduction 
 Cyclodextrins (CDs) are naturally occurring torus - shaped molecules composed of 6, 7, 
or 8 D - glucose units. A fascinating property of CDs is their ability to incorporate other 
organic compounds into their cavities in aqueous solution.  1   Since their discovery, CDs 
have served as prototypes for novel host compounds and catalysts. The use of CDs as 
 microvessels  to perform chemical reactions has attracted the interest of chemists since 
the 1960s.  2   Effects of CDs on reactions are mainly divided into two categories. The ﬁ rst 
effect is the catalytic effect, designated as the  ‘ enzyme model. ’  CD and the reactant ini-
tially form a CD - reactant reaction intermediate involving a covalent bond, which then 
proceeds to product. The second effect does not involve a covalent bond. The cavity of 
CD presents a new reaction environment to the reactant, an  ‘  extra reaction ﬁ eld ’ , in which 
the reactivity, such as rate or selectivity, changes. In these cases, the role of the CD does 
not always catalyze, but  mediates  the reaction. The CD cavity is less polar than the bulk 
aqueous medium. The permittivity in the CD cavity is known to be nearly the same as 
that of dioxane. The microenvironment around the reactant in the CD cavity is different 
from that in the reaction media. Three distinct microenvironmental effects are expected: 
a) microsolvent effects, b) the protection of unstable intermediates or products, and c) the 
solubilization of the reactant. In addition, conformational effects can also be expected:

d) control of the reactant conformation, e) control of the orientation between reactants, 
and f) control of the size of molecule. A combination of several of these effects is evident 
in organic reactions. 
 Many organic, photochemical, radiochemical, electrochemical, and biochemical reac-
tions have been carried out with CD cavities under various conditions, such as in the solid 
phase, in a heterogeneous suspension of water, or in organic solvents. These reactions 
were reported in a previous review. 3   Although the main driving force for formation of an 
inclusion complex between a CD cavity and a guest molecule is the hydrophobic interac-
tion, appreciable selectivity has been achieved in organic solvents such as pyridine, DMF, 
THF, toluene, and CCl 4 . The results in the solid state and in organic solvents suggest that 
other interactions must also be considered. 
 On the other hand, water is of particular interest, because it is a safe, inexpensive, and 
environmentally friendly solvent, which makes its use favorable both in academic labo-
ratories and in industry. The pioneering studies of Diels – Alder reactions in water by 
Breslow 4   in the early 1980s triggered a more widespread interest in the use of water as 
a medium for organic synthesis, not only because these reactions eliminate the necessity 
of vigorously drying solvents and substrates, but also because of the unique reactivity 
and selectivity found in water. Thus, considerable effort has been made in developing 
water - based synthetic organic reactions.  5   Studying organic reactions mediated by CD is 
important not only in supramolecular chemistry but also in green chemistry. The number 
of papers reporting reactions mediated by CDs has been increasing exponentially and it 
would be impossible to cover them in the present limited space. In this chapter, the author 
wishes to indicate the origin of the concept and some representative reactions mediated 
by CDs in water. The  ‘ now ’ and  ‘ then ’ in CD science will be indicated. 
 4.2  The Inclusion Phenomena of Cyclodextrins 
 Before describing organic reactions mediated by CDs, some explanation of the inclusion 
phenomena with CD is warranted, focusing on the complexation mode and interactions. 
Most of our understanding of CD inclusion phenomena has been derived from studying 
the aqueous phase in an equilibrium state. In this state, hydrophobic forces are assumed 
to be responsible for driving a guest into the CD ’ s hydrophobic interior, where a 1   :   1 
host – guest complex usually forms and where there is no interaction with other CD 
molecules. 
 The complexation mode :  stoichiometries ,  conformations ,  and dynamics : The possibility 
of simultaneous formation of complexes with different stoichiometries must also be con-
sidered. Cooperative binding, a bi - molecular process, has been observed, as well as the 
uni - molecular process, producing a 1   :   1 complex in either a  ‘ head - to - tail (HT), ’  ‘ tail - to -
 tail (TT) ’  or  ‘ head - to - head (HH) ’  state. Moreover, a study of the ﬂ uorescence decay of a 
number of anilinonaphthalene sulfonates in the presence of CD supported the view that 
a 1   :   1 complex can be present in several slightly different conformations. There are, in 
fact, various conformations and orientations of reactants as well as varying mobilities in 
reactant - CD complexes. 
 Interactions : The complexation is based on a combination of several intermolecular 
interactions depending on the solvent and the nature of the host and guest: steric ﬁ t, van 
der Waals interactions, dispersive forces, dipole – dipole interactions, charge - transfer

interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. The choice of reaction 
media used in CD systems also depends on the above combination of interactions. The 
study of organic reactions mediated by CDs means the study of interactions in the CD 
molecule. It should be noted that CD can also include guest molecules in the solid state. 
Such host – guest complexes must clearly be discriminated from other host compounds, 
i.e., clathrates only in the solid state and crown ethers only in solution. Inclusion complex 
formation in the gas phase is expected to be different from that in liquid phases. Short -
 range London forces or polar interactions are responsible for host – guest complexation in 
nonaqueous environments. Clearly, there is the possibility of many kinds of interactions 
to comprise the inclusion phenomena both in solid and solution states. This is the advan-
tage of using CDs for supramolecular functions. 
 4.3  Origin of Microvessels as Molecular Flasks 
 4.3.1  Ternary Complex Formation with  γ - CD 
 γ  - CD has a large cavity, which can accommodate two molecules of naphthalene deriva-
tives. This two - guest inclusion phenomenon in CD chemistry was ﬁ rst reported in   γ - CD -
 induced excimer ﬂ uorescence. 6   Solutions containing only sodium   α - naphthylacetate (NA) 
at a high concentration exhibit a structureless band appearing at a longer wavelength than 
the normal band in the ﬂ uorescence spectrum. This band can be attributed to excimer 
emission since the ratio of intensities of excimer to monomer ﬂ uorescence is proportional 
to the concentration of naphthalene derivatives. Upon addition of   α - ,   β - , and   γ - CD, both 
normal and excimer ﬂ uorescence intensities were markedly enhanced only upon increas-
ing  γ  - CD concentration. The accompanying enhancement of the normal ﬂ uorescence 
might be attributed to the formation of a 1   :   1 complex, but this rationalization was incon-
sistent with the observation that a dilute solution of NA (10  − 4  mol  L  − 1 ) showed no enhance-
ment despite the presence of excess   γ - CD (10  − 2  mol  L  − 1 ). Thus, the enhancement of normal 
ﬂ uorescence was attributed to a 1   :   2 complex formation. This is the ﬁ rst example in which 
two identical molecules were included into a CD cavity. The excimer ﬂ uorescence 
depended on the structure of the naphthyl derivative. It is impossible to predict what kind 
of monosubstituted naphthalene derivatives would be included in the   γ - CD cavity with 
1  :  2 stoichiometry. (Figure  4.1 a). The ﬂ uorescence study also suggested that two different 
kinds of guest molecules could be included in the   γ - CD cavity. 7 The ﬂ uorescence intensity 
of   α  - naphthyloxyacetic acid in aqueous solution was slightly enhanced by the addition 
of  γ  - CD, but markedly enhanced in the presence of both   γ - CD and cyclohexanol, showing 
a ternary complex formation among   γ - CD,   α - naphthyloxyacetic acid and cyclohexanol 
(Figure  4.1 b). These properties of   γ  - CD enabled us to make use of   γ - CD as a reaction 
medium in which two different kinds of molecules, such as a catalyst and a substrate, 
could be brought together effectively. Ueno commented that this phenomenon showed 
that CD  mediates the reactions, in other words,  ‘ CD acts as molecular ﬂ ask ’ in water. 8 
 4.3.2  Organic Reactions Mediated by  γ - CD 
 A modiﬁ ed   γ - CD bearing an  O - 2 - naphthylacetyl substituent produced larger overall ester 
hydrolysis rates in water (pH 8.7)  9   than native   γ - CD. A 12 - fold increase was observed 
for  p  - nitrophenyl acetate, arising from both an increased rate of intracomplex hydrolysis

and stronger binding, and an 11 - fold increase for  m - nitrophenyl acetate, arising from 
stronger binding. The results were presumed to be due to spacer effects of the appended 
naphthalene moiety, which narrows the large   γ - CD cavity. 
 Redox reactions can be controlled by complexes between one host and two guest mol-
ecules. For example, the redox reaction between  N - benzylnicotinamide and ninhydrin was 
affected by the addition of CD.   γ  - CD facilitated the formation of the ternary complex of 
catalyst - substrate -  γ - CD in a 1  :  1  :  1 ratio, in which the redox reaction proceeded. However, 
 β  - CD inhibited the formation of the catalyst - substrate complex, decreasing the reaction 
rate. This is an example in which the CD cavity controlled the catalyst - substrate complex 
formation.  10 
 When   γ  - CD has one naphthyl pendant, it shows normal ﬂ uorescence whose intensity 
is enhanced by the addition of ( − ) - borneol, reﬂ ecting that the naphthyl pendant is included 
with the guest molecule in the   γ  - CD cavity. When naphthalene is added to a solution of 
the host, excimer emission appears as the result of the face - to - face interaction between 
the naphthalene pendant and the naphthalene guest in the cavity. When two molecules 
of the anthracene derivative were attached to the primary hydroxyl side of   γ - CD, 
photoirradiation yielded the capped   γ  - CD with a rigid anthracene dimer on the primary 
hydroxyl side of   γ - CD. The bis(anthracene - 9 - carbonyl) -  γ  - CD system gives only the  trans -
 photodimer as a stable photodimer, but it may be possible to produce several stable 
photodimers if an anthracene - 1 - carbonyl unit was used in place of an anthracene - 9 - 
carbonyl unit. From this viewpoint, Ueno  et al . prepared a series of bisanthracene 
modiﬁ ed - γ  - CDs and used photodimerization in a   γ  - CD as a template. The anthracene 
groups of   γ  - CDs AB, AC, AD, and AE isomers underwent reversible dimerization upon 
irradiation, and afforded capping compounds. Although the  trans - head - tail (HT) or  trans -
 head - head (HH) dimer is usually the favored conﬁ guration in C - 9 - substituted, photoin-
duced anthracene dimers, the product from AB dimers displays a  cis - head - head (HH) or 
 cis - head - tail (HT) geometry only. AB - capped CD was the least stable of the AB, AC, 
AD and AE substituted CDs, owing to the strain within the short bridge. As a result, it 
was demonstrated that the stereochemistry of these bimolecular reactions can be control-
led by this   γ  - CD method. Inoue has also reported that native   γ - CD afforded HT photodim-
ers in good yield and enantioexcess (ee).  11   The stereoselectivity for HH photoproducts 
improved in the anthracenecarbonyl -   γ  - CD system and depended on external effectors, 
such as temperature, solvent and pressure (Figure  4.2 ). 12 
 Higher selectivity has been reported using 3,6 - anhydro -  γ - CD instead of native   γ - CD. 13 
It has been known that anhydro - CD has a distorted cavity. Interestingly, the isomer -  and

enantioselectivity of the photocyclodimerization are switched in the solid state. Solid - state 
photolyses gave inherently disfavored HH photodimers in much higher chemical and 
optical yields than in aqueous solutions. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra indicated that 
the switching of the stereoselectivity is primarily attributable to the varied arrangement 
of anthracene derivative pairs in the ground state. 
 Recently, the efﬁ ciency of CD for the enzymatic synthesis of neoglycolipids, which 
are barely water soluble, was described.  14   Increasing the concentration of   γ - CD led to an 
increase in the limitation of the concentration of the sugar peptide substrate, which sug-
gested that CDs did not work as surfactants or phase transfer systems but as molecular 
recognition systems. CD did not affect the HPLC puriﬁ cation and did not cause any 
lather. These merits are superior to the surfactants commonly used in such cases. In this 
study, a bridge between oligosaccharide synthesis using cell function  in vivo  and enzy-
matic synthesis  in vitro  was constructed which established the possibility of cellular -
 chemoenzymatic synthesis (Figure  4.3 ). 
 4.3.3  Ternary Complex Formation with  β - CD 
 Since the cavity size of   γ  - CD is wider than that of   β  - CD, there should be more reactions 
mediated by   γ  - CD. However, there have been fewer reports of  ‘ mediation ’  with   γ - CD 
than with   β  - CD. Why? To mediate organic reactions with CD, at least two molecules 
must aggregate closely in the CD cavity. We have searched for reports showing a nar-
rower cavity sized CD including two or more guest molecules. Azo - capped CD (AzCD), 
which was prepared from   β - CD and 4,4 ′ - bis(chlorocarbonyl)azobenzene, can form a 
ternary complex with some organic guest molecules (Figure  4.4 ).  15 These remarkable 
complexation properties were studied with the help of CD spectra. The  trans - cis mixture 
in a photostationary state and the  trans  - isomer have distinctly different CD traces, as can 
be seen in Figure  4.5 . The CD bands lose some of their intensity in the presence of guest 
molecules. From the concentration dependence of the ellipticity, conclusions can be 
drawn on both the stoichiometry and the association constant of the inclusion compound. 
The guest molecule, e.g., toluene, cyclohexanol, or methoxybenzene, and the conﬁ gura-
tionally isomeric terpenes, e.g., nerol and geraniol, were included in  cis - AzCD with a 1  :  2 
host – guest stoichiometry, but only in a 1   :   1 ratio in the  trans - AzCD. The complexes of

 cis  - AzCD are more stable than those of the corresponding native   β - CD, whereas the 
 trans  - isomer shows less binding properties. It is interesting that the 1   :   1  cis - AzCD - 
geraniol complex is more stable than the corresponding nerol compound, but that in the 
1  :  2 complexes the situation is reversed. 
 The different complexation properties of the  trans - and  cis  - AzCD are attributed to the 
difference in cavity size induced by the conﬁ guration of the azo double bond. It is assumed 
that the cavity of  cis  - AzCD is deeper than both that of  trans - AzCD and native CD. The 
cavity of  trans  - AzCD might be shallow and broader. This is the reason why the ﬁ rst guest 
molecule binds more strongly than the second.  p - Nitrophenylacetate was hydrolyzed

preferentially by  cis - AzCD over the  trans  - isomer, as deduced from the 5 - fold increase in 
the apparent overall hydrolysis rate.  16   In addition, AzCD displays catalytic activity in the 
hydrolysis of  m - nitrophenylacetate, whereas native   β - CD has  m - selectivity. This inver-
sion is triggered by the deeper cavity space provided by  cis - AzCD, which allows binding 
of the  p - isomer in  cis - AzCD. 
 With chiral guests, both  trans - and  cis - AzCD were found to form 1  :  1 and 1  :  2 host –
 guest complexes, 17   with the  cis  - complex being much more stable. The inclusion behavior 
towards chiral guests was of particular interest. The formation constants for 1   :   2 com-
plexes are summarized in Table  4.1 . Those for the 1   :   1 complex could not be determined 
since the values are too large to be measured. Differences in the formation constants of 
the enantiomeric guest molecules were observed, where the  trans - and  cis - AzCD show 
exactly opposite enantioselectivities. These results could be attributed to the changed 
depth of the CD cavity, from a shallow cavity to a deep one upon  trans  to  cis photo-
isomerization of the cap azobenzene. The stereoselectivity observed might arise from the 
interactions of the guest molecule with the CD rim or wall corresponding to the shallow 
or deep depth of the cavity, although the chiral guest itself might also participate in the 
chiral discrimination. It is assumed that interactions of the guest with the rim or the wall 
of the CD are at the origin of the selectivity. Even though the enantioselectivity of chiral 
guests with AzCD complexes is relatively poor, this can nonetheless be called photocon-
trolled chiral recognition by complexation. 
 These results hold particular interest in the reversed photoregulated system of molecu-
lar functions. Thus, the AzCD results suggested that the cavity of   β - CD can include more

than two molecules in different conformations as in the wide cavity sized   γ - CD (Figure

the inclusion with interactions with the wall or cap of the cavity. One of the developing 
ﬁ elds in CD chemistry is  ‘ self - guest modiﬁ cation ’ , 18   in which a   β - CD sensoring system

 4.4  Organic Reactions Mediated by  CD in Water 
 The main characteristic effect of CDs is improvement of reaction selectivity. Herein, 
several examples of reactions mediated by CD are introduced. The reactions proceed in 
natural and mild conditions, in the presence of CD with water as the solvent. The reac-
tions were achieved in good yields (over 80%) and CD could be reused in the system. 
The reaction conditions are described in the Schemes. 
 4.4.1  Catalytic Systems Based on Metal Complexes 
 Recently, there have been many reports on the effects of CD on metal catalytic systems. 
A potentially interesting approach for the modiﬁ cation of catalytic systems based on metal 
complexes, such as Zn, Mo, Fe, In, Sn, Pd or Ru, involves the use of CD as a protective 
agent. There are many reports on the interaction between CDs and metallic nanoparti-
cles. 20   Immobilized CD on Pd nanoparticles was employed as an efﬁ cient mediator in 
aqueous biphasic hydrogenation reactions (Figure  4.6 a,b). 21 
 Randomly hydroxylated and methylated CD (RM -   β  - CD) with different cavity sizes 
have been used as biphasic aqueous catalysts in a palladium catalyzed Tsuji – Trost reac-
tion with water - insoluble alkylallylcarbonates and alkylallylurethanes as substrates 
(Figure  4.6 c). 22   The reaction rate and substrate selectivity strongly depended on the cavity 
size of the CD. The cavity size is a crucial factor in controlling the substrate selectivity. 
Moreover, phosphanes that did not interact with the methylated CD were the most

efﬁ cient mass - transfer promoters in an aqueous biphasic palladium - catalyzed Tsuji – Trost 
reaction. 23 
 The Suzuki reaction is the reaction of an aryl or vinyl boronic acid with an aryl or vinyl 
halide catalyzed by a palladium(0) complex. It is widely used to synthesize polyoleﬁ ns, 
styrenes, and substituted biphenyls, and has been extended to incorporate alkyl bromides. 
Experimentally, the coupling reactions between aryl halides and arylboronic derivatives 
were mainly performed using a phosphine - palladium catalyst in homogeneous, hetero-
geneous, or biphasic systems.  24 RM -  β  - CDs have shown polyvalent properties in a bipha-
sic Pd/C - catalyzed Suzuki – Miyaura reaction (Figure  4.7 ). 25 In addition to their mass 
transfer ability, CDs favored the dispersion of the catalyst in water. With the RM -   β - CDs, 
the gains in initial activities were multiplied by factors between 3.8 and 343 depending 
on the nature of the substrates. This could be explained by assuming adsorption of the 
CD on the surface of the Pd/C catalyst. Indeed, adsorption of CD increases the hydrophilic

character of the support, making its dispersion easier in the aqueous phase. The perform-
ance of this catalytic system is likely a consequence of a combination of two effects: the 
well - known mass transfer promoter properties of the CDs and their dispersing role on the 
Pd/C catalyst. This was the ﬁ rst example of CD - stabilized Pd/C particles for a catalytic 
application. PPV - based polyrotaxanes were prepared by coupling vinyl boronic acids to 
aryl iodides in the presence of   α - or   β  - CDs. The crystal structure of the [2]rotaxane of 
this type was also determined. 26 
 Chiral ruthenium complexes with a monoaminoalcohol modiﬁ ed   β - CD were shown to 
catalyze the reduction of aliphatic ketones with up to 97% ee and in excellent yields in 
the presence of HCO 2 Na. 27   The ratio of catalyst, substrate and sodium formate was 
1  :  10  :  100. Although a number of highly enantioselective ruthenium - based hydrogen -
 transfer catalysts are known, 28 including one example that functions in water, none of 
these systems have been shown to reduce unconjugated ketones.  29   CD made the complex 
soluble in water and played an important role in the enantioselectivity through preorgani-
zation of the substrates in the hydrophobic cavity. 
 The use of CDs in molybdenum - catalyzed oleﬁ n epoxidation may be particularly 
advantageous in cases where the  ‘ free ’  catalyst is initially highly active but loses activity 
during the reaction as a result of decomposition. CD may help to stabilize the metal cata-
lyst and also facilitate subsequent recycling.   η - C 5 H 5 Fe(CO) 2 Cl,   η - C 5 H 5 - Mo(CO) 3 Cl, and 
 η - C 5 H 5 - Mo(CO) 3 CH 2 CONH 2  are included in   β - CD with a 1  :  1 stoichiometry. The latter 
could be used directly as precursors of catalysts for the epoxidation of cyclooctane with 
 t - BuOOH 30 or H 2 O 2 .   β  - CD adducts have the potential to be used both in heterogeneous 
solid - liquid systems and biphasic liquid - liquid systems. The structures of single crystals 
of the   η - C 5 H 5 Fe(CO) 2 Cl and permethylated -  β - CD, heptakis - (2,3,6 - O - methyl) -  β - CD, 
were described. The metal - complex – CD exhibited signiﬁ cant catalytic activity in the 
oleﬁ n epoxidation system with H 2 O 2 , with cyclooctane oxide being the only observed 
reaction product. 31 
 Homoallylic alcohols were directly prepared from aromatic acetals and dioxolanes 
( ≥  80%) using a Barbier - type allylation, Zn/allyl bromide/NH4Cl, in the presence of   β - CD 
in water at 50    ° C (Figure  4.8 ). 32   The synthesis of enantiomerically enriched homoallylic 
alcohols is an important goal in organic synthesis. An enantioselective metal - mediated 
allylation of substituted benzaldehydes with   β - CD was achieved. 33 The reaction proceeds 
in short reaction times (1  h) at room temperature. The homoallylic alcohols are obtained 
in moderate yields with up to 93% enantioexcess. 
 4.4.2  Ring Opening Reactions 
 Reductive ring opening of epoxides with NaBH 4  has also been inﬂ uenced by the addition 
of CDs (Figures  4.9  and  4.10 ). Styrene oxide smoothly underwent a ring - opening reaction 
with NaBH 4  and 2   mol equiv. of a   β  - CD to give 1 - phenylethanol with up to 90% selectiv-
ity. 34   Chiral recognition in the complex formation was excluded as the reason for the 
enrichment of the enantioselectivity. The reaction rate of the NaBH 4  reduction for the 
 β - CD - R  form is faster than that for the   β - CD - S  form, this rate difference giving prefer-
entially the  S  form. Similar phenomena have been reported in oxidations in crystalline 
complexes. 35   The reactions of other aryloxyepoxides were affected by the presence of 
 β - CD to proceed regioselectively. 36   Highly regioselective ring opening of epoxides to

halohydrins has been carried out with hydrogen and lithium halides in the presence 
of  β - CD. 37 
 The   β  - CD inclusion complexes of aryloxyepoxides with amines afforded amino-
alcohols enantioselectively in the solid state. 38   When carried out in water as the reaction 
medium, nearly racemic aminoalcohols were produced. 
 N  - Activated aziridines are versatile intermediates for the synthesis of many biologically 
active compounds. Aziridines can be easily prepared and the inherent ring strain leads to 
high reactivity with various nucleophiles, such as organometallic reagents, Wittig rea-
gents, amines, hydroxyl compounds, and metal halides (InX 3 , NaX, MgBr 2 , CeCl 3 /7H 2 O/
NaI, TMSI). In the presence of   β  - CD, a variety of  N - tosylaziridines underwent regioselec-
tive ring opening with tetrabutylammonium halides (TBAX) at pH 4 and room tempera-
ture to afford the corresponding haloamines ( ≥ 84%). 39 
 α  - Tosylaminoketones could be generated directly from easily accessible aziridines with 
 β - CD and  N - bromosuccinimide (NBS) ( ≥ 85%) in a single step. 40 With the combination 
of  β - CD and NBS,   α  - hydroxymethylarylketones were prepared from oxiranes at room 
temperature within 1 – 2 days. 41   α  - Aminoarylketones provide starting materials for the 
synthesis of biologically active   β  - aminoalcohols. Only a few direct methods have been 
reported for their synthesis. However, these methods have various limitations such as the 
use of transition metal catalysts, organic solvents, controlled temperatures, long reaction 
times, and hazardous reagents. Thus, there is still a need to develop cleaner synthetic 
methodologies for the generation of   α - aminoketones. 
 NBS is a commonly used oxidizing reagent. Selective oxidation of sulﬁ des and addition 
to oleﬁ ns was also mediated by CD. A simple and highly selective oxidation of sulﬁ des 
to sulfoxides with NBS in the presence of   β - CD has been reported (Figure  4.11 a). 42 A 
series of sulﬁ des were oxidized selectively without overoxidation to sulfones ( ≥ 90%). 
The reaction proceeded under neutral and mild conditions and could be carried out easily 
with recycling of CD and regeneration of NBS (Figure  4.11 b).   
 vic - Halohydrins (bromo - and iodohydrins) were synthesized regioselectively in a one -
 step procedure by treating the corresponding oleﬁ ns at room temperature with NBS and

cleaved regioselectivity (Figure  4.11 c). 44 
 The direct one - pot synthesis of   β  - hydroxy selenides was reported. In the presence 
of   β  - CD, highly regioselective ring - opening of oxiranes with benzenesenol was achieved 
( ≥ 75%). 45  β - CD could also be recovered and reused. 
 In the presence of   β  - CD, ring opening of epoxides with various thiophenols proceeds 
with high regioselectivity.   β  - CD can also be recovered and reused in various runs without 
affecting the efﬁ ciency of the process.  46   Highly regioselective ring opening of oxiranes 
to  β  - hydroxy ethers with phenoxides has been achieved ( ≥ 94%). 47   β - hydroxynitriles and 
 β  - aminoalcohols have been synthesized regioselectively from epoxides and  N - tosyl azi-
dines in the presence of   β - CD. 48 
 2 - Iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) is attractive due to its low toxicity, ease of handling, and 
moisture stability. Various epoxides and aziridines were cleaved with IBX to afford 
 α - hydroxyketones and   α - aminoketones, respectively. 49   Carbonyl compounds were also 
prepared from the corresponding tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ethers directly with IBX and 
 β  - CD. The yields obtained were up to 96% (Figure  4.12 ).  50 No overoxidized products 
were detected in the case of aldehydes. In these reactions, the role of CD appears to be 
to activate the THP ethers by hydrogen bonding and thereby facilitating the hydrolysis. 
Since the   β  - CD cavity is hydrophobic, it may also be forming reversible complexes with 
the THP ethers. When the reaction was performed without IBX, only deprotection 
occurred and no oxidized product was isolated. Without CD, no deprotection took place 
and hence no oxidation occurred.

 4.4.3  Addition 
 Allylation of carbonyl compounds is an important carbon – carbon bond forming reaction 
in organic chemistry for the preparation of homoallylic alcohols. Homoallylic alcohols 
are useful tools for the construction of complex molecules and are important building 
blocks for the synthesis of natural products. A highly efﬁ cient allylation of aldehydes 
with allyltributyltin has been developed mediated by   β  - CD in the presence of HCl without 
any metal catalysts to afford the corresponding homoallylic alcohols ( ≥ 88%: Figure 
 4.8 a). 51   CD can be recovered and reused for a number of runs without signiﬁ cant loss of 
activity. The key process is inclusion in the CD cavity. This process is more important 
than hydrogen bonding between the aldehyde and hydroxyl group on the rim of the CD 
cavity. As described earlier, homoallylic alcohols could be prepared by adding CD to the 
metal catalyzed reaction systems (Figure  4.8 ). 
 The aza - Michael reaction, which is an important reaction for the synthesis of hetero-
cycles containing a  β  - amino carbonyl unit, could be mediated by CD in water to produce 
the corresponding   β - amino compounds ( > 80%) under mild conditions, at room tempera-
ture and for 6 – 8  h reaction time (Figure  4.13 a). 52   Interestingly, Michael additions of 
nitroalkanes to methyl vinyl ketone are also known to occur in the presence of sugars.  53 
No reaction was observed without CD. Hydrogen bonding of amines with the CD hydroxyl 
makes the N – H bond weaker, enhancing the nucleophilicity of nitrogen for addition to 
electron - deﬁ cient alkenes. 
 Michael addition of thiols from the secondary side of   β - CD to   α , β - unsaturated com-
pounds at the primary side was described (up to 97%: Figure  4.13 b).  54   Products of unde-
sirable side reactions resulting from polymerization were not observed. In addition, the 
use of CD precludes the use of either acid or base and the catalyst can be recovered and 
reused.

 3 - Indolyl - 3 - hydroxy oxindoles were prepared by   β  - CD complexes with indoles under

 Phosphorus – carbon bond formation has attracted growing attention because of its 
application in organic synthesis and bioorganic chemistry.   α - Functionalized phosphonic 
acids are valuable intermediates for the preparation of medical compounds and synthetic 
intermediates. 1 - Aminophosphonic acids are important substrates for the corresponding 
 α  - amino acids in biological systems. The Kabachnik – Fields synthesis, which is the most 
convenient method to synthesize 1 - aminophosphonic acids, is catalysed by base or acids 
such as SnCl 2 , BF 3 .Et 2 O and MgBr 2  and cannot be carried out in a one - step operation. 
However,   α - aminophosphonic esters were obtained in a one - pot synthesis with   β - CD 
(45 – 82%) with good purity under mild conditions by the reaction of diethyl phosphate 
with a mixture of aldehyde and amine at reﬂ ux for 12 – 24  h (Figure  4.14 ). 56 
 The Strecker reaction that is the nucleophilic addition of trimethylsilyl cyanide

and the catalyst can be recycled a number of times without loss in activity. No reaction

was observed without CD. The mechanism was suggested as follows: hydrogen bonding 
of the CD hydroxyl with the nitrogen of the imine increases the electrophilicity of the 
imine carbon, thus activating it for attack by the cyanide ion. 
 Monoprotection of amines/amino acids with Cbz – Cl proceeded in only 1   h in high yield 
( ≥ 90%) with 0.1  mol% of   β - CD. 58   This reaction proceeds without the formation of by -
 products and has advantages over existing methods (Figure  4.15 b and  4.15 c). 
 The thiazole ring system is a useful structural motif found in numerous biologically 
active molecules. Addition of thioamide or thiourea to the aqueous solution of phenacyl 
bromide - β  - CD complex gave the corresponding thiazole or aminothiazole, respectively 
( ≥ 82%), without the formation of by - products or rearranged products (Figure  4.16 ).  59 
The role of CD appears to be to activate and solubilize the phenacyl bromide, and 
drive the reaction to completion in decreased reaction times. Without CD, the reaction 
took place but the yields were poor (20%). Selenazoles were also prepared from   α -
 bromoketones and selenourea in the presence of   β - CD at 50  ° C under atmospheric 
pressure. 60 
 The aldol reaction is an important carbon – carbon bond formation reaction in organic 
chemistry. To get high enantioselectivity, the use of a chiral secondary amine, such as 
proline, has been reported. Interestingly, proline - catalyzed aldol reactions do not show 
any non - linear effects. This strategy allows the otherwise challenging cross - aldol reac-
tion between two aldehydes. Proline modiﬁ ed   β  - CD catalyzes the asymmetric aldol 
reaction. 61 The aldol reaction of various aromatic aldehydes with cyclohexanone is 
mediated by the inclusion complex of a proline derivative and  β - CD, yielding hydroxy -
 ketones with an  anti / syn  ratio of up to 99   :   1 and ee values well above 90%.  62 The 
asymmetric catalytic system mediated by sulfated   β  - CD, which can bind an organo-
catalyst of  tert  - butylphenoxyproline and associated hydrophobic reactant in a water –
 organic solvent phase system, has been developed.  63   With this system, only 10   mol% 
of CD induces the highly enantiopure aldol products in near quantitative yields. 
 The use of CD provides a unique way to study the reactivity of cation radicals of small 
oligothiophenes and oligopyrroles in water,  64   especially in the case of bithiophene and 
terthiophene for which the lack of water solubility does not allow such a study. After 
photochemical oxidation, the cation radical leaves the CD host to undergo coupling with 
another cation radical, similar to reactions occurring in organic media, with no reaction 
between cation radicals.

and synthetic points of view. The most important method for their synthesis is the conver-
sion of oxiranes to thiiranes by an oxygen – sulfur exchange reaction. Oxiranes react 
smoothly with thiourea in the presence of   β  - CD to afford the corresponding thiiranes and 
the  β - CD can be recycled (Figure  4.18 ). 66 
 4.4.4  Oxidation and Reduction 
 After precomplexation with   β - CD, a variety of alcohols, including aromatic alcohols, 
were oxidized to their corresponding carbonyl compounds in good yields with NaOCl –
 KBr in aqueous solution.  67 A substrate - selective and transition metal - free oxidation 
of benzoic and allylic alcohols with NaOCl oxidant mediated by   β - CD in water was 
developed.  68   In the presence of one molar equivalent of   β - CD, benzyl alcohol, 4 - 
methoxybenzyl alcohol and some primary aromatic alcohols were oxidated to form 
benzaldehyde, 4 - methoxybenzaldehyde and aromatic aldehydes, respectively, at 50    ° C for 
1 – 4  h. When 20% of acetone was added to the reaction system, the yield of aldehyde was 
dramatically decreased. 
 NaBH 4  is the most generally used reduction reagent in aqueous solution, albeit with 
poor selectivity. The highly asymmetric reduction of ketones with NaBH 4 has been per-
formed with crystalline CD complexes since the 1970s.  69,70   It was suggested that hydrogen 
bonding between the carbonyl group of the substrate and the   β - CD secondary hydroxyl 
groups may result in the enantiomeric face - selective attack of the hydride anion.

 Doussot  et al . have reported that regio -  and stereoselectivity in the reduction of sub-
stituted epoxides and aromatic ketones with NaBH 4  in the presence of CDs depended 
mainly on interactions with the wider rim, the secondary hydroxyl side, of the CD. This 
indicates that an alkoxyborohydride intermediate is formed in the ﬁ rst step of the 
reaction. 71 
 Various   α  - azido alkyl ketones were reported to be reduced with good enantiospe-
ciﬁ city by NaBH 4  in the presence of   β  - CD. High enantioselectivity was induced 
by the interaction between the substrate and hydroxyl groups on the wider rim of CD. 
The high selectivity may be due to the stability of the CD – substrate complexes and 
the orientation of the carbonyl group within the complex. Sodium dithionate, which 
is also easily handled and is a water - soluble reducing reagent, has been used with 
 β  - CD for the stereoselective reduction of (R) - ( − ) - carvone, 72 menthone, 73 and compounds 
having carbon – carbon double bonds next to the   α , β - carbonyl group. 74 Interestingly, a 
remarkable effect by CD on the menthone product was found in mixed - solvent systems. 
Aqueous DMF (1   :   1) increased the yield from 14% without CD to 76% with   β - CD 
in water, the menthol/neomenthol ratio being 3.6/1.0 under phase - transfer conditions. 
Lipophilic CD, heptakis(2,6 -  O - methyl) -  β  - CD (DMCD), in a water – benzene mixture 
gave an 82.0% yield with good stereoselectivity (the menthol/neomenthol ratio being 
2.0/1.0). DMCD also affected the reaction of compounds that have carbon – carbon 
double bonds next to the   α , β  - carbonyl group in a water – toluene mixture (1  :  1). Both 
complexation and reduction seem to occur mainly in the organic phase, leading to a 
very high yield. 
 In aqueous or organic solvents, it is possible that the reagent or substrate can still form 
a host – guest complex through speciﬁ c interactions with the CD. Adequate modiﬁ cation 
of the CD to form new interaction points or adequate change of the cavity can be expected 
to result in appreciable ee in an asymmetric reaction. 
 Higher enantioselectivity in the reduction of benzoylformic acid (BFA) using NaBH 4 
has been reported using mono - 6 - deoxyamino -  β - CD (ACD) as the host, instead of   β - CD, 
in neutral aqueous solution.  75   The phenyl group is used to control cavity size and the sp 3 
carbons between the parent CD cavity and the phenyl group act as a ﬂ exible arm. As 
shown in Figure  4.19 , the enantioselectivity was related to the orientation of the substrate 
in the presence of a  ‘ self - guest group ’ . In the case of BFA, when the substrate is held 
between the cavity and the bulky hydrophobic substituent of the modiﬁ ed CD, a higher 
ee is obtained. When BFA cannot participate in self - inclusion, then lower ee ’ s are 
observed. In the case of an oval - shaped substrate, such as indol - 3 - pyruvic acid (IPA), 
which cannot participate in the self - inclusion, but can form an outside complex near the 
rim of the CD derivative, high enantioselectivities were observed with almost all of the 
amino - CD derivatives, irrespective of the position of the substituent.  76 These results 
suggest that the rim of the CD cavity also may lead to substantial improvements in organic 
reactions. 
 Reduction of mononitroarenes mediated by   β - CD has been reported 77 using hydroxide 
ion as a reductant. Ordinarily the reducing ability of OH  −   in water is very low as a result 
of its stabilization by hydration. Reductions by OH  −   have only been observed in aprotic 
organic solvents. CD includes the reactant (nitrobenzene) and the reaction is carried out 
near the rim of the cavity.

 4.5  Conclusion 
 Many organic reactions have been carried out with CD cavities in water. In the early 
stages of CD chemistry, the subject was limited to organic chemistry. Many reactions 
related to the inorganic ﬁ eld have since been reported. The most attractive advantage of 
CD is its  ‘ selectivity ’ , however, the solvation effect cannot be ignored. To develop CD -
 mediated reactions, it is necessary to clarify the reaction mechanism in detail. Complexation 
certainly induces selectivity. Although it is difﬁ cult to elucidate the role of the CD, 
complex orientation in the reaction transition state must be made clear at the molecular 
level. 
 The early stages in CD chemistry presented many chemists with a very impressive 
concept, that of a host – guest complex which has been described as a ball in a bottomless 
pail. We have shown that the ball or guest is not always in the pail cavity. Other interac-
tions play sufﬁ ciently signiﬁ cant roles in that they recognize the ball and thus mediate 
the reaction. Indeed, hydrogen bonding between the guest and secondary hydroxyl groups 
at the wider rim of the cavity are suggested to explain the reaction mechanism. The so -
 called  ‘ rims ’  of the pail also have to be considered. The rims have great potential to 
interact with the guest molecules through hydrogen bonds polar interaction supported by 
the hydrophobic cavity. Without rims, CD cannot mediate that many reactions. This is

the reason why   β  - CD derivatives can mediate many reactions. More recently, computa-
tional chemistry has played a role in understanding CD chemistry. However, the relation-
ship between CD chemistry and molecular modelling has not yet been established. A 
simple and easy method to express the molecular structure based on the practical results 
is needed. CD is not a bottomless pail. Where are the  ‘ hydrophobic ﬁ elds ’ ? Which CD 
has a symmetrical round cavity? CD has carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms forming 
glucose rings. The molecular structure of CD which is drawn in molecular level can 
provide new applications in supramolecular chemistry. For example, molecular drawing 
of the inclusion complex between two   γ  - CDs and two Congo red molecules with MOPAC 
are indicated in Figure  4.20 .  78   The methods with CD are very simple, generating high 
yields in water. Water is a safe, economical and environmentally friendly solvent. Since 
green chemistry has become such an important issue in the 21 st  century, reactions medi-
ated by CD warrant increased attention.

     Zeolites are naturally occurring minerals found in volcanic rocks where they have been 
formed by hydrothermal processes. The term  ‘ zeolite ’  has been introduced by the Swedish 
mineralogist Cronstedt who gave the name according to the observation of the large 
amount of water they release upon heating.  ‘ Zeolite ’  is indeed derived from the Greek 
 ‘ zein ’ (to boil) and  ‘ lithos ’ (stone). 
 Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates materials that possess ordered and intercon-
nected microporous channels with diameters ranging from 0.2 – 20     Å
´ . Their unique proper-
ties (microporosity, high surface area, acid – base character, shape) have made them a 
material of choice in a great number of applications. Zeolites are intensively used in gas 
separation due to their ability to adsorb selectively a large variety of molecules and are 
also known as molecular sieves. Furthermore, these materials are also used as ion exchang-
ers (water softeners) and catalysts in petrochemistry. Currently, the world ’ s annual pro-
duction of natural zeolite is about 4 million tons. Of this quantity, 2.6 million tons are 
shipped to Chinese markets to be used in the concrete industry. The amount of synthetic 
zeolites produced is about 1.5 million tons (Figure  5.1 ).   
 The number of known zeolitic structures is currently 174 but, according to theoretical 
work based on these existing stable structures, there might be several million structures 
available which would be more or less stable. Hence designing a zeolitic material for a

chemical reaction or chemical storage should be feasible and may open new opportunities 
for the use of these materials in the future.  1   Existing computational methods may allow 
to select a zeolite for a targeted reaction product.  2   For instance in biomass conversion, 
novel large pores zeolites may be very adapted to convert oligosaccharide to fuels. 
 Zeolites tridimensional porous structure arises from a framework of [SiO 4 ] 4 −  and 
[AlO 4 ] 5 −  tetrahedra TO 4  linked together by their corners. During the synthesis, these 
primary building blocks assemble by sharing O atoms, thus creating an inﬁ nite lattice 
with identical unit cells. Each Si ion has its 4+ charge balanced by the four surrounding 
O, so that Si tetrahedron is electrically neutral. Hence pure siliceous zeolites are electri-
cally neutral. By replacing part of Si ions with Al (with a formal charge 3+), a negatively 
charged tetrahedron is created. Therefore each Al ion requires a 1+ charge from a cation 
which can be Na + in most of the case and also  NH4
+ or Ca 2+ , K + , and so on. 
 These ions can be reversibly exchanged giving zeolites their most important application 
in ion exchange such as water softener in detergent (largest use) and water puriﬁ cation. 
Among others, H +  counterions may compensate the negative charge as well. The protons 
are formally assigned to be bonded to the bridging O of a Si − O − Al bond, forming 
hydroxyl groups that act as a Br ø nsted acid. The so - called Br ø nsted acid sites are char-
acterized by their acid strength, which depends on their environment, i.e. on the chemical 
composition (density of protonic sites, heteroatoms such as P) and the structure of the 
zeolite (geometry, cages and conﬁ guration).

 The local environment of the acid site is determined by the zeolite topology that 
imposes a deﬁ ned coordination of the TO 4  tetrahedra in the framework. This leads to 
different amounts of topologically non - equivalent TO 4  sites which induce heterogeneity 
in the acid strength distribution as well as a difference in accessibility. Together, the acid 
character of these materials and the pore size of the channels that falls in the range of the 
kinetic radii of many organic molecules give a unique synergy for the use of zeolites as 
acid catalysts in numerous industrial key reactions. 
 As catalysts, zeolites have found their most important application in petroleum reﬁ ning 
processes. Their acid function is used in Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), in hydroisom-
erisation of light alkane fraction as well as in oligomerisation and isomerisation steps to 
upgrade the liquid fuels into gasoline and diesel. The combination of two different zeolites 
in the same industrial process is illustrated in the Shell – UOP TIP process: an acidic 
zeolite, MOR, is used for isomerisation and the neutral LTA is used as molecular sieve 
for separation as shown in the scheme below (Figure  5.3 ).   
 In 1999, Tanabe and Hoelderich  3   have reviewed 74 industrial processes ranging from 
cracking to ﬁ ne chemical synthesis in which zeolites are used as a catalyst. 
 Numerous books and reviews have already been published concerning organic reac-
tions catalysed by zeolites.  4 – 6   Due to their pore sizes, their internal shapes and their 
compositions,  7   zeolites are well known for their selectivity properties, discriminating 
reactants, intermediates, transition states or products. 8

Molecular Encapsulation
 Zeolites can be considered as microreactors and one may ﬁ nd some analogy with 
enzymatic - like systems:  9 
 •      the differential diffusion in the zeolite channels between products and reactants of dif-
ferent size allows a control on the selectivity on chemical reactions,  
 •      the preferential adsorption of molecules in the channels as a function of their polarity 
offers a selective activation of chemical compounds. The electrostatic ﬁ eld inside the 
cavities and channels, depending strongly on the Si/Al ratio, can be tuned by isomor-
phous substitution of Si and Al in the framework. Hence one can drive the adsorption 
selectivity towards hydrophilic/hydrophobic and polar/non - polar molecules by the syn-
thesis of a zeolite with an appropriate Si/Al ratio, 
 •      molecules that are absorbed in a channel or cavity tend to optimize their conﬁ guration 
towards the most favourable Van der Waals interaction with the cavity or channels walls 
under the conﬁ nement effect. When the molecular size of an adsorbate is close to the 
dimension of the cavity or channels, its frontier molecular orbitals HOMO – LUMO are 
strongly affected. It has been evidenced that adsorbed molecules inside a zeolite channel 
or cavity show increased basic character and greater reactivity.    
 Last but not least, as easily recoverable and reusable catalysts, zeolites also allow to 
perform acid - mediated transformations with a clear environmental beneﬁ t, since it avoids 
the formation of huge amounts of salts which is typically encountered in acid catalyzed 
processes. Noteworthy, zeolites can also host active catalytic species such as metals or 
organometallic complexes for ﬁ ne chemical synthesis.

 5.1  The Conﬁ nement Effect 
 The so - called  conﬁ nement effect in microporous and mesoporous materials is known to 
strongly affect diffusion and catalytic properties.  10   Various approaches have been used to 
characterise this effect. Denayer and Baron, in a chromatographic study of the adsorption 
properties of linear alkanes in various mesoporous materials, proposed to deﬁ ne a conﬁ ne-
ment factor Z as the ratio of adsorption entropy over adsorption enthalpy.  11 For non - polar 
molecules, the adsorption enthalpy reﬂ ects the energetic interaction between the molecule 
and the zeolite force ﬁ eld and increases with decreasing pore size. The adsorption entropy 
relates to the amount of freedom lost by going from bulk state to adsorbed state. Using 
calorimetry, gravimetry and in - situ infrared spectroscopy, Lercher and Eder showed that 
the apolar alkanes are very locally adsorbed via hydrogen bonding. By monitoring the 
disappearance of infrared absorption bands of O − H groups from the zeolite, they were 
able to distinguish a precise population of protons that are involved in the adsorption of 
alkanes. For instance, with  n  - hexane and zeolite Mordenite (MOR), they convincingly 
showed that only protons in 12 and 10 membered ring pores were involved in hydrogen 
bonding with the alkane whereas the protons located in 8 membered ring pores the sorp-
tion was hindered. The hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group of the zeolite and 
the hydrocarbons induces a dipole in the hydrocarbon that is at the origin of their 
reactivity. 12,13 
 The conﬁ nement effect has been evidenced both by quantum chemical calculations as 
well as spectroscopic investigations on naphthalene molecule entrapped within a zeolite 
by the group of A. Corma.  9,14 – 17   As an example, the aromaticity of anthracene was strongly 
perturbed due to limitation of the   π  - orbital spatial extension induced by the proximity of 
the pore walls depending on the size of the pores. This  ‘ electronic conﬁ nement effect ’ is 
particularly large when a tight host – guest conﬁ guration occurs. It has been suggested that 
this effect implies important consequences in terms of reactivity, particularly for the reac-
tions involving electric charge donation from the guest molecule to the zeolite framework 
atoms. Reactions, like proton transfer for example, will be favoured in conﬁ ned systems 
where the rise in the frontier occupied molecular orbitals will make the electronic transfer 
easier. An other example is provided in a computer modelling study of acetonitrile adsorp-
tion in Mordenite:  19   the nitrogen atom of the molecule in the side pockets favours interac-
tion with the proton of an OH group in these conﬁ ned sites. The role of side pockets has 
also been demonstrated in many other cases.  18,19 
 Remarkably, the conﬁ nement in the small channels of Mordenite zeolite (side pocket) 
polarizes signiﬁ cantly the acetonitrile molecule toward protonation. It leads to a long 
residence time of the adsorbate in the neighbourhood of the acidic hydroxyl group, and 
modiﬁ es greatly the charge distribution (even in a silicic zeolite), contributing to the 
explanation of the preferred protonation of acetonitrile in side pockets of acidic Mordenites. 
 In a more intuitive way, Derouane 20 proposed that zeolites should be considered as 
solid solvents, a concept very familiar to organic chemists. 
 By the characterisation of the acidic OH groups in zeolites of different types, Hunger  18 
interpreted NH 3 – TPD results in the light of conﬁ nement effects: in the Faujasite (FAU) 
structure, a bimodal distribution of adsorption energies in both the supercages and the 
sodalite cages was found, with the stronger acid sites being more common in the super-
cages. In contrast, essentially the same acid strength for different regions in MOR is seen,

though the acid strength for the sites located in the side pockets may be slightly higher. 
For FER and MFI, the TPD gives unimodal distributions and therefore prohibits distinc-
tion between different regions.   
 Using a mesostructured aluminosilicate of the MCM - 41 type with the same composi-
tion but varying the pore size from 2.3 to 9.3   nm, Tanchoux  et al . 21   measured the adsorp-
tion energetics and the catalytic isomerisation of 1 - hexene. The authors could demonstrate 
that the geometry - dependent contributions dominated catalytic behaviour over all other 
factors. 
 However, for the understanding of catalytic hydrocarbon conversion over solid acid 
catalysts, there is still a sharp contrast between the general agreement on the similarity 
with carbocation chemistry and the lack of experimental information on the mode of 
formation or the nature of the carbocationic intermediates.  22,23   Many years ago, on the 
basis of the initial product distribution in the cracking of light alkanes at high temperature, 
the Haag – Dessau mechanism 24,25 (sigma - bond protolysis as in superacids 26 – 28 ) was sug-
gested, but hydride abstraction, oxidation and alkene impurities have also been suggested 
as possible ﬁ rst step in the formation of the reaction intermediates. 29 – 31 
 It has been shown that simple carbenium ions can only be considered as transient 
species (unless with a large charge distribution) within the zeolite channels and that the

most stable intermediates are the framework - bound alkoxy species  32 – 34 . However, the 
existence of carbocations as short - lived reaction intermediates  35   in equilibrium with the 
alkoxy species is supported by the Koch reaction,  36,37   halogen switch reaction  38 or H/D 
exchange reactions 29,30 observed in reactions catalysed by zeolites. 
 Based on  ab initio  calculations using a FAU supercage as model, Van Santen and 
Pitko 39   demonstrated that the role of the zeolite framework in the photooxidation of 
alkenes with molecular oxygen is the complexation of the hydrocarbon and O 2  to the 
exchanged cations, resulting in conﬁ nement of these molecules with a speciﬁ c relative 
orientation. This leads to the formation of a   π – π  intermolecular complex. The interaction 
between alkene and oxygen in this complex occurs with a ﬁ nite overlap of the involved 
orbitals. The formation of such a complex results in a signiﬁ cant transition moment of 
the intermolecular charge transfer. The role of the electrostatic ﬁ eld of the zeolite is only 
indirect. It stabilizes the reagents in a suitable  ‘ pre - transition state ’ conﬁ guration. For the 
model DFT calculations a Mg 2 Al 14 Si 12 O 20 H 24 cluster was chosen. 
 Partial oxidation of aromatics is one of the most challenging reactions in the ﬁ eld of 
organic synthesis. Oxidation of benzene to phenol using N 2 O as oxidant on ZSM - 5 - type 
catalysts between 300 and 400    ° C could be achieved with a selectivity close to 100%.  40,41 
A substitution mechanistic scheme involving the formation of a hydroxyl group bonded 
to the zeolite surface (HO – ZSM - 5) and its further attack on benzene was proposed. 42 
 The density functional theory study considering the possible reaction intermediates also 
conﬁ rmed the possible formation of protonated nitrous oxide, leading to a Wheland - type 
intermediate, thus supporting an electrophilic aromatic substitution assisted by the con-
ﬁ ned environment provided by the active zeolite framework. 
 Acid form of zeolite H – ZSM - 5 (MFI type) has particularly attracted attention since 
researchers at Mobil have developed the methanol to gasoline process. In this process, 
small pores zeolites with 8 -  to 12 - membered rings have shown outstanding catalytic 
activities in the transformation of methanol (C 1 alcohol) into alkanes in the gasoline range

but also into oleﬁ ns in the methanol to oleﬁ n reaction (MTO).  43,44 Interestingly, the 
product distribution can be controlled by the zeolite properties among other parameters. 
For instance, the reaction could be directed towards the production of light oleﬁ ns such 
as the key industrial ethylene and propylene using a small pore zeolite with a modiﬁ ed 
chemical composition (silica – alumina – phosphate known as SAPO, AlPO … ). As a typical 
example, the SAPO - 34 being an 8 - membered ring zeolite (chabazite - type, CHA) is less 
acidic compared to its silica – alumina (H – CHA) equivalent and allows a very high selec-
tivity to ethylene and propylene when used in a properly designed reactor. Hydro/UOP 
process, which is developed in Norway, allows the selective production of ethylene or 
propylene using a silico – alumino – phosphate zeolite. 45 Methanol conversion to valuable

 Scheme 5.4   Methanol to oleﬁ ns general simpliﬁ ed reaction scheme  
products is obviously of primary importance and will probably gain even more importance 
as oil resources are progressively depleted. 46 
 From a mechanistic point of view, the C − C coupling is of utmost interest because it 
may eventually allow the selective synthesis of valuable alkanes and oleﬁ ns (Scheme  5.4 ). 
Despite experimental observation of formation of methyl groups on the surface of zeolites 
at the early stage of the reaction  47 – 50   and an ongoing research on the possible impurities 
triggering the ﬁ rst C − C formation, there is still a debate over the molecular mechanisms 
involved at the beginning of the reaction. Although computational studies usually exclude 
the formation of oxonium ylide  51   (Scheme  5.5 ) due to the lack of basicity of the zeolites 
framework, the role and the nature of impurities at the origin of the so called carbon pool 
are still quite obscure. 
 For the latter steps, there is a general agreement that the production of light alkanes 
and oleﬁ ns in zeolite is auto catalyzed by large aromatic rings  52   that are formed within 
the zeolites channels and have been evidenced by spectroscopy.  53 – 56 Although a similar 
chemistry is also observed on non - zeolitic materials,  57 – 60   the selective production of eth-
ylene and propylene may probably be enhanced by the zeolites cage effects. 
 Strong effects of the pore size and the shape of zeolites have been clearly evidenced 
in the case of alkanes having comparable molecular dimensions. Remarkable contribu-
tions have shown that the adsorption enthalpy of alkanes is strongly dependent on both 
the topology of the zeolite and the branching and geometry of the alkanes  12 . The adsorp-
tion enthalpy becomes higher as the number of carbons in the alkane increases. Some 
critical carbon numbers have been recently found by Denayer  et al . depending on the 
cage size of the zeolite. These authors have rationalised their results by the spatial demand 
of the alkane within the zeolite.  61   As long as the alkane can ﬁ t inside a single zeolite cage, 
they have observed the well known linear increase of enthalpy of adsorption with increased 
number of carbons. At some point, they showed that the enthalpy does not increase lin-
early anymore and they have argued that the spatial constraint within the zeolitic cage 
impose a geometrical rearrangement of the alkane itself. Further, for higher carbon 
numbers, the linear increase of adsorption enthalpy has again been observed with increas-
ing carbon numbers. That phenomenon was attributed to the adsorption of large alkane 
in two neighbouring cages.

 Another remarkable demonstration of the conﬁ nement effect was described in the 
carbonylation of dimethyl ether by Iglesia and co - workers.  62   Surface methoxy groups are 
the simplest and most stable alkoxide species because they cannot deprotonate to give 
more stable products under mild conditions. The reactivity of surface methoxy with CO 
is very different from one zeolite to another. In their experimental work Iglesia  et al . have 
observed that the rate of carbonylation of dimethyl ether is much higher in the case of 
H – MOR than for other zeolites. H – MOR consists of 12 - membered ring main channels 
intersecting 8 - membered ring channels (also known as  ‘ side pockets ’ ). They have been 
able to show experimentally that methyl groups located in these side pockets are much 
more prone to the carbonylation than those located in the 12 - membered ring main chan-
nels. The molecular architecture of the side pockets may be particularly favourable to 
stabilize the acylium like transition state or may impose the reaction between approaching 
CO and surface methyl groups because of the constrained space. These studies clearly 
demonstrated the role of the local structure of the zeolites on the reactivity of methoxy 
groups with CO which acts as a nucleophile in this case. Furthermore, Iglesia  et al . have 
published a note about the thermodynamics in small alkanes (C3 – C6) C − C bond activa-

tion. In monomolecular cracking of these alkanes the turnover rate increases with the 
number of carbons of the alkane chain while the activation energy remains size independ-
ent. The increase of turnover rates of the cracking reaction was explained by the con-
comitant increase of activation entropies. 63 
 Last but not least, the versatility of zeolites is demonstrated by exchanging the acidic 
proton with deuteron which enables investigation of interesting mechanisms related to 
catalysis and by exchanging the proton with transition metal cations, such as Cu(I), and 
opens new areas of environmentally friendly organic chemistry. For these reasons, we 
are including in this chapter acidic - zeolite catalysed reactions from our own work which 
can be best understood as examples of conﬁ nement effects: superelectrophilic, Cu(I) cata-
lysed Click chemistry, and speciﬁ c H/D exchange reactions. 
 5.2  Superelectrophilic Activation in Zeolites 
 The term  ‘ Superelectrophile ’  was suggested by Olah in the early seventies when it was 
noticed that acylation of chlorobenzene by acetyl tetraﬂ uoroborate was substantially 
accelerated in the presence of the corresponding Br ø nsted acid. 64 
 Superelectrophilic intermediates 64   are typically generated when a cationic electrophile 
is further protonated or coordinated by a Lewis acid to produce a dicationic species.

 Similarly, superelectrophilic solvation  65   may also involve weaker interactions without 
forming limiting dications resulting in enhanced electrophilic reactivity. In order to be 
involved in superelectrophilic activation the starting molecule is best bifunctional. 
 In the last two decades many useful reactions and synthetic approaches involve supere-
lectrophilic activation of reagents mediated by liquid superacids or by excess of alu-
minium halides. As an example,   α , β  - unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, acids or amides, 
readily condense with aromatics such as benzene and dichlorobenzene which are poor 
nucleophiles, but only in the presence of a large excess of aluminium chloride or triﬂ ic 
acid. This reactivity has been interpreted by the intermediacy of dicationic species. 
 Reaction kinetics, 66 theoretical calculations 67 and ﬁ nally the observation of such species 
by NMR in superacids  68   as stable dications point out the reliability of this mechanistical 
hypothesis under superacidic conditions. 
 Zeolites have been successfully applied in similar reactions. As the acidity of 
H – zeolites 69 – 70  , is generally considered to be well below that of superacids  26 
( − 12  <  Ho  <  − 24), the hypothesis of identical dicationic intermediates may be easily 
discarded, but we assume that conﬁ ned space may allow a strong activation by imposing 
a strong interaction between protons of the surface and the electrophile. In other words, 
the framework of the solid acid may provide close proximity of acidic sites enabling the 
formation of diprotonated (or coordinated) species. Moreover, an effective compensation 
of comparatively low proton acidity of zeolites may be obtained due to nucleophilic 
assistance of the lattice oxygens in the transition state of a concerted mechanism resulting 
in an increase of the protonation rate.  71   Similarly, the enzyme mediated protonation of a 
heterocyclic carbocation  72   provides an example showing that structural factors of acids 
can have a profound inﬂ uence in electrophilic activation.

 The arylation of naphthol, which does not occur in the presence of triﬂ ic acid was 
successfully achieved by using benzene as solvent in a pressure tube at 130    ° C with 
H - USY with 72% yield. 73 
 As a further example,   α , β  - unsaturated carbonyl compounds possess two sites which 
can undergo reduction: the carbonyl group and the adjacent C − C - double bond. While an 
abundant literature is available on the selective reduction of the carbonyl group, often 
achieved with relative ease, the selective hydrogenation of the double bond suffers from 
the lack of simple methods using practical chemicals. Selective ionic hydrogenation 
of   α , β  - unsaturated carbonyl compounds with cyclohexane was previously known to 
proceed only in superacidic conditions due to the necessity of dicationic, superelec-
trophilic activation of the enones. H - form zeolites with acidity well below superacidity 
are however also able to induce the reduction of   α , β - unsaturated carbonyl compounds 
with cyclohexane, in analogy, or sometimes even better than the  ‘ parent ’ , superacid medi-
ated reactions. 52,74 
 Furthermore, arylvinylketones were efﬁ ciently converted to indanones using zeolite 
to  promote cyclization. 75   Indanones are indeed one of the most useful family of com-
pounds, which can be obtained from arylvinylketones, since they are the basis of many 
biologically active compounds including indacrinones, indanoyl isoleucine conjugates, 
indanocines and other medicinally important products. 
 The zeolite nature and the substitution pattern in the starting materials proved critical: 
2 - substituted arylvinylketones reacted more readily in H – ZSM5, giving high yield ( > 90%)

of the corresponding indanones, while the 3 - substituted are more efﬁ ciently converted to 
the corresponding indanones by H – USY. However in the presence of a more nucleophilic 
aromatic solvent such as toluene competitive alkylation is observed. 
 The interaction of   α , β  - unsaturated carboxylic acids with benzene derivatives was 
investigated in H – zeolites and led to two distinct but competing processes, cycliacyaryla-
tion and decarboxyarylation. Interestingly, H – USY selectively induced the cycliacyaryla-
tion cascade reaction, whereas H – ZSM5 selectively promoted decarboxyarylation. 76 
 Recently, for the ﬁ rst time, copper(I) - exchanged zeolites were developed as catalysts 
in organic synthesis. 77 These solid materials proved to be versatile and efﬁ cient hetero-
geneous ligand - free catalytic systems. Cheap and easy to prepare, these catalysts exhibited 
a wide scope and a good compatibility with functional groups. They are very simple to 
use, easy to remove (by simple ﬁ ltration) and they are recyclable. 
 5.3  Huisgen [3+2] - Cycloadditions 
 The ﬁ rst application we found was the Huisgen [3+2] - cycloaddition, between a terminal 
alkyne and an azide, to date the most practical and useful  ‘ click ’  reaction, regioselectively 
affording 1,4 - disubstituted 1,2,3 - triazoles (Scheme  5.14 ). 
 Investigations with deuterated alkynes and deuterated zeolites proved that this Cu(I) –
 zeolite - catalysed  ‘ click ’  reaction exhibited a mechanism different from the one reported 
for the Meldal – Sharpless version. which relies on the intermediate formation of copper 
acetylides (Scheme  5.15 ). Therefore, if such species were also formed within zeolites, 
deuteroalkynes would not give deuterated triazoles as observed. (Scheme  5.16 ) 
 We have also shown that copper(I) - modiﬁ ed zeolites can be used as catalysts for the 
[3+2] cycloaddition of pyrazol - 3 - one ylides with alkynes. 78 This heterogeneous method 
offers a mild and efﬁ cient access to tetrahydropyrazolo[1,2 - a]pyrazol - 3 - ones with a rea-
sonably wide scope, tolerating various functional groups, and with high regioselectivity.

 Experiments with labelled materials suggested in this case involvement of copper

 5.4  Multicomponent Reactions 
 One of the fundamental aspects in  ‘ Green Chemistry ’  is linked to the number of steps in 
organic synthesis as well as atom economy. Multicomponent reactions (MCR) are thus 
becoming a more and more important class of reactions since they allow combining 
several starting materials in usually a single compound and in a one - ﬂ ask operation. 
 Cu(I) - modiﬁ ed zeolites, especially Cu(I) – USY, proved to be very efﬁ cient catalyst in 
multicomponent reaction. 80   Such catalysts allowed for an efﬁ cient,  solvent - free synthesis 
of propargylamines from aldehydes, amines and terminal alkynes with high yields. 
 Propargylic amines are high value building blocks in organic synthesis, and the 
corresponding structural motif has been found in various natural products, and in com-
pounds of pharmaceutical or phytoprotective relevance. They can be obtained by addition 
of alkynes to imines, but since imines are easily formed from aldehydes and amines,

3 - component versions are known, either as such or promoted by various transition metals. 
A few supported versions or versions based on heterogeneous catalysts have recently been 
described, but zeolite - catalyzed version has only been reported recently. 
 Based on the use of deuteroalkynes the mechanism was suggested to involve copper –
 acetylides (Scheme  5.19 ). 
 In our experimental work on small alkanes activation on solid acids and zeolites we 
have also observed a very close relationship between zeolitic structure and alkane reac-
tivity. The ﬁ rst observable interaction of hydrocarbons with the acidic protons on the 
surface of the catalyst consists of a fast hydron exchange that can be monitored using 
isotopic labelling. 81 This technique has been applied with various small alkanes as probes 
in order to understand the activation mechanism. For instance in the case of isobu-
tane 29,82,83 a regiospeciﬁ c exchange on the methyl groups was observed in the H/D 
exchange reaction with solid acids being in agreement with a general mechanism based 
on intermediate carbenium ions (classical trivalent carbocation). Once the carbocation is 
generated it is in equilibrium with its corresponding oleﬁ n on the surface by a fast 
deprotonation/reprotonation step. Similarly, we  84,85 and others 86,87   have studied more 
recently both the H/D exchange and the skeletal rearrangement in the reaction between 
propane and sulfated zirconia as well as zeolite using deuterium and carbon - 13 as labels. 
With the help of  in situ  solid state MAS NMR the intra -  and intermolecular rearrange-
ments in propane were fully characterized providing strong evidences for a mechanism 
based on carbenium ions. Again the fast deprotonation/reprotonation process involving 
the equilibrium between the  sec  - propyl carbenium and propene, explains the Markovnikov -
 type incorporation of deuterium in the methyl group. In the aim to correlate better the 
acidity to the proton transfer it is preferable to study alkanes that cannot form an oleﬁ n 
by deprotonation such as methane and neopentane (2,2 - dimethylpropane). As methyl 
cations are not generated under mild condition, due to their high energy, methane does 
undergo H/D exchange on solid acids without secondary reaction.  88,89 This exchange can

only be possible via a concerted mechanism in which the transition state resembles that 
of a carbonium ion presenting a 2electron - 3centre bond as in protonated methane. This 
species can be considered as the conjugated acid of methane. Non - classical cations were 
earlier suggested as transition state or strongly solvated intermediates in the H/D exchange 
reaction between methane and superacids DF/SbF 5 90 or DSO 3 F/SbF 5 . 91 While the reactiv-
ity of hydrocarbons in liquid superacids is clearly due to the   σ - basicity of their C − H 
bonds, 66,92   the mechanistic pathway involves the surface of solid acids and the participa-
tion of nucleophilic oxygen lone pairs compensating the lack of superacidity and stabiliz-
ing charges. 93 – 95 
 2,2 - Dimethylpropane (neopentane) is a  ‘ limiting ’  case on the   σ - basicity scale for 
alkanes 96   because protolysis can only take place either on a primary C − H bond or on a 
C − C bond. Its behaviour in superacids has been studied in the late 1960s by Olah  et al . 
in HSO 3 F/SbF 5 97,98   and Hogeveen  et al . in HF/SbF 5 . 99   Depending on the acidity and steric 
factors, protolytic cleavage takes place either on the C − H bond or on a C − C bond, dem-
onstrating the close basic character of both   σ  - bonds. Neopentane cracking has been previ-
ously studied over solid acids such as silica – aluminas, protonic zeolites  100 – 102 metal 
exchanged zeolites,  103,104   promoted and unpromoted sulfated zirconia.  105 The analysis of 
products distribution has revealed a protolytic cleavage of the C − C bond yielding methane 
and the adsorbed  t - butyl cation as primary products. 
 The C − H bond activation characterized by H/D exchange with solid acids allows 
ranking solid acids by their activity and acidity.  106   Moreover neopentane being a bulky 
probe 107 is sensible to steric hindrance and conﬁ nement effect. 108 
 In full agreement with Haag and Dessau hypothesis,  24 the ﬁ rst step consists in the 
protolysis of a C − C bond leading to the carbonium species (I) as a discrete intermediate 
or a transition state. In the next step methane and the adsorbed  t - butyl cation are simul-
taneously formed and further deprotonation of the latter leads to various oligomerisation/
cracking reactions (Scheme  5.20 ). Intermediate II was generally discarded in the litera-
ture, mainly because it would generate the primary highly energetic neopentyl cation. 
While this second pathway was highlighted in superacidic media by the formation of  t -
 amyl cation resulting from the 1,2 methyl shift, several authors described the C − C bond 
protolysis as the major pathway on solid acids rather than the C − H bond protolysis. 106 – 111 
We have shown that the species II should not be neglected as a direct exchange between 
primary protons and the solid acid was observed.  106 
 5.4.1  H / D Exchange Between Neopentane and Zeolites 
 Neopentane was recirculated on deuterated zeolites (D – MOR, D – FAU, D – ZSM - 5, 
D – BEA) at temperatures between 473 and 573  K. H/D exchange took place without any 
side reaction at the beginning of the reaction and the ﬁ rst order rate of deuteration of 
neopentane itself was determined at short contact times. It should be pointed out that the 
isotopomers of neopentane are formed in a consecutive way: D1 → D2 → D3 → D4  … and 
so on. This corresponds to an H/D exchange reaction where one hydron is exchanged at 
a time. At higher temperatures, the competitive C − C bond cleavage takes place in a non 
negligible rate. For this reason we have limited our study to the H/D exchange of neo-
pentane as follows: on D – USY between 523 and 573   K, D – BEA 513 – 548  K as well as 
D – ZSM5 (513 – 543  K) following the same experimental procedure.

 5.4.2  H / D Exchange Between Neopentane and Zirconia 
 Sulfated zirconia is known to activate hydrocarbons at low temperature.  109   In the case of 
the well studied  n  - butane isomerization, but also for propane rearrangement the ﬁ rst step 
is most probably an oxidative dehydrogenation.  110,111   The synthesis of the material con-
stitutes also a crucial point for its activity towards alkanes.  112,113   The catalyst we used in 
this study readily exchanged its deuterons with the hydrons of neopentane in the tempera-
ture range of 483 – 513  K. At higher temperature C − C protolysis competes signiﬁ cantly 
with H/D exchange. The experimental results have highlighted the ability of acidic sites 
of sulfated zirconia to generate a carbonium ion (species II, scheme  5.20 ) at such moder-
ate temperature. Sulfated zirconia apart from its well known oxidative properties exhibits 
sufﬁ ciently strong acid sites allowing the generation of a pentacoordinated carbon simi-
larly to carbonium - type ions in liquid superacids. 
 5.4.3  H / D Exchange and Acidity 
 The analysis of kinetic data of the H/D exchange allowed us to determinate the activation 
energies for each solid acid. The Eyring equation separates the free enthalpy from the 
entropic contribution for a better comparison and comprehension of the transition state 
involved in the proton transfer process. 
 Figure  5.8  shows that the free enthalpy of activation   ∆ H# of the H/D exchange between 
neopentane and zeolites is very close for all zeolites tested. The similarity of these values 
is consistent with a common transition state in the H/D exchange step on zeolites. Further

 Scheme 5.20   Protolysis and H/D exchange in the activation of neopentane on solid 
acids 106 
MFI, USY, respectively) revealed an important participation of the surface in the transition 
state, constraining the transition in a deﬁ ned geometry. In other words, the signiﬁ cant loss 
of entropy evidenced a strongly concerted mechanism with the surface. 
 Species II (Scheme  5.20 ) should rather be represented as an activated complex in which 
the surface of the solid acid delocalizes extensively the charge as proposed earlier.  97 – 99 
Accordingly, the value   ∆ H# calculated for sulfated zirconia differed markedly from those 
of zeolites, most probably due to the difference in chemical composition of the surface. 
This result constitutes a further proof of the strong involvement of the surface in the 
transition state. This situation is nevertheless very similar to what happens in liquid 
superacids for the activation of methane. In a previous study, the H/D exchange between 
methane and DSO 3 F/SbF 5  –  varying the SbF 5  concentration  –  showed not only a unique 
transition state for all systems but also a strong participation of the anionic part in the 
transition state. Hence, an analogy between these superacidic media and zeolites was 
proposed on the basis of kinetic analysis, and the rate of exchange at a given temperature 
should correlate directly with the acidity of the system. 
 Remarkably, at 523   K the rates of exchange were found to be in the same order of 
magnitude for all zeolites tested. In agreement with the previous studies on neopentane 
cracking, mordenite showed the highest activity among zeolites. Again, in full analogy 
with previous results in superacids,  98   since the transition state is unique for all zeolites as 
well as in the case of the exchange between CH 4  and DSO 3 F/SbF 5 , we suggested that the 
activity in H/D exchange can be related to the acidity of zeolites. The order of activity 
appears to be the following: MOR > MFI > BEA > FAU. Generally the Si/Al ratio is consid-
ered as a major parameter to characterize the acidity of the zeolites. Nevertheless Si/Al 
ratio difference in this study was not sufﬁ cient to explain the difference observed for the 
activity in H/D exchange. In fact the activity of zeolites seemed to ﬁ t more with the size

of the pores. Considering the most conﬁ ned space or the smallest pore of zeolite allows 
ﬁ nding the order of activity of zeolites in H/D exchange with neopentane. The closer the 
molecular size of the probe ﬁ ts with the pores, the more basic the probe becomes, thus 
facilitating the acid catalysis. Busca  et al . and Thibault - Starzyck  et al . have very recently 
published their results concerning the adsorption of nitriles and pyridines in zeolite.  114 – 117 
It is very interesting to note that acetonitrile can enter such small pores as the  ‘ side 
pockets ’  of Mordenite (3.4    ×  4.8  Å ) at low temperature. In contrast these authors demon-
strated by IR spectroscopy that pivalonitrile could not enter these small pores and remains 
in the main channel of Mordenite. Neopentane is an isolobal analog of pivalonitrile having 
a diameter of 6.2    Å  which prevents the entry in the  ‘ side pockets ’ . However, computa-
tional studies showed clearly that a methyl group having a critical diameter of 4    Å enters 
the  ‘ side pockets ’  of mordenite when temperature is increased.  117   Indeed the increase of 
temperature implies a greater ﬂ exibility of the framework and allows the distortion of the 
molecular probe. 118,119 On the same basis Nascimento has also shown that neopentane can 
enter the MFI channel (5.3    ×  5.6  Å ). 120   Taking into account these results, it seems that the 
order of activity of the zeolites we present here emphasizes the conﬁ nement effect. 
Mordenite is the most active catalyst for the H/D exchange of neopentane as well as for 
its cracking and H/D exchange takes place at lower temperature than with the other zeo-
lites. Considering the  ‘ side pockets ’  as ideal sites where the methyl group of neopentane 
can be optimally protonated can explain these experimental data. Therefore the order of 
activity found for H/D exchange between zeolites and neopentane seems to be strongly 
related to the size of the pores.  
 5.5  Conclusion 
 Never has the need for Green Chemistry and clean technology using processes that gener-
ate little or no waste, been greater than at present. 
 Zeolites are important molecular sieves or heterogeneous catalysts which may operate 
under mild and environmentally benign conditions preferably without use of non - aqueous 
or any other solvents. They present the advantages, in comparison with previously used 
alumina - based catalysts, of having a better long - term stability, and yielding higher product 
selectivity. The higher selectivity of this class of catalysts originates from the well - deﬁ ned 
micropore structures of the zeolite crystals, which lead to size - and shape - dependent 
adsorption, reaction, or diffusion of the reactants or products. It is therefore of interest to 
study the behaviour of well - documented probes with novel zeolitic materials in order to 
assess whether new topological effects, not previously found in conventional zeolites, can 
be observed. The adsorption strength is strongly dependent on the molecule to pore size 
ratio via the so - called  ‘ conﬁ nement effect . ’  Because in different types of zeolites the OH 
groups, as well as the metals, are located in pores, channels, and cages of different size 
and shape, the  conﬁ nement effect  should be considered when comparing the properties of 
zeolites on the basis of adsorption of probe molecules. Zeolite micropores have also a 
stabilizing effect on the reaction transition states. This stabilization has been demonstrated 
to be of a short - range electrostatic nature and to involve polarization of zeolite oxygen 
atoms, which is of course related to the molecule to pore size ratio. Nevertheless the 
problem of selecting the optimal pore size for a given reaction has no unique solution.

which underline the ability of zeolites to operate selectively under mild, environmentally

 6.1  Introduction 
 Supramolecular chemistry, deﬁ ned by Jean - Marie Lehn as the  ‘ chemistry beyond the 
molecule ’ , is the application of programmed molecules that assemble into larger molecu-
lar architectures via intermolecular non - covalent bonds.  1,2   An important class of supramo-
lecular structures is that of the host – guest assemblies, where the host is a receptor that 
selectively binds (generally smaller) guest molecules.  3 – 5   For some time now, a lot of 
attention has focused on mimicking Nature and controlling non - covalent host – guest 
interactions in synthetic systems, with the aim to arrive at artiﬁ cial supramolecular 
catalysis, i.e. deﬁ ned substrate orientation and pre - activation at an encapsulated catalyti-
cally active centre or in a cavity.  6   It has appeared to be a major challenge to go beyond 
the  ‘ straightforward ’  assembly of appropriate known catalysts, functional groups and 
substrates, e.g. in bioinorganic chemistry, as this in general has so far not resulted in 
catalytic activities or selectivities that can match those displayed by nature ’ s machinery, 
although many an astounding (structural) feat has been accomplished.  7 To fully capture 
all beneﬁ cial aspects displayed by enzymes it should be emphasized that several effects 
contribute to the unique properties exhibited by the (metallo)enzyme active site, such 
as substrate preorganization, restricted substrate motion, protein dynamics, covalent

Molecular Encapsulation
binding of the transition state and desolvation of the substrate,  8   most of which are induced 
by the speciﬁ c micro - environment created inside the enzyme cavity. Especially desolva-
tion, i.e. the exclusion of typical  ‘ organic ’  solvent or aqueous media in which generally 
speaking homogeneous catalysis is taking place, and which tend to heavily inﬂ uence 
chemical reaction, and the substitute governing role taken on by the speciﬁ c micro -
 environment created around the substrates are largely underestimated and two of the 
challenging features of enzyme - mimicking. The conditions created within the micro -
 environment depend on precisely constructed favorable interactions as well as a dissimilar 
dielectric constant. However, such cavity effects are difﬁ cult to study and have mainly 
been put forth on the basis of computational studies. Synthetic approaches to selectively 
assemble such nanosized reaction chambers, i.e. nanoreactors, are therefore highly 
desired, since they would enable experimental veriﬁ cation with synthetic analogues. In 
addition, the ability to control the reaction environment by creating a conﬁ ned and well -
 deﬁ ned nanospace around the substrates could provide new entries and opportunities to 
develop sustainable catalytic processes. 
 6.2  Self - Assembled Nanocapsules 
 Molecular capsules are a special class of host molecules with a very deﬁ ned three -
 dimensional structure, including a hollow interior which under judicious conditions could 
engage in  ‘ binding ’  of guest molecules by encapsulation within the enclosed internal 
space, i.e. the cavity. 9 Besides mere physical entrapment, it can be easily envisioned that 
additional attractive forces, e.g. hydrophobic interactions,   π – π  interactions, or weak 
coordinative interactions can aid in the selective encapsulation of particular guest mole-
cules. Two types of these nanometer - sized molecular capsules can be distinguished; the 
covalent based capsules and the non - covalent based capsules i.e. self - assembled or 
supramolecular capsules.  10 Guest exchange in - and - out of non - covalent capsules can, in 
addition to a gating mechanism, i.e. diffusion of molecules through voids in the supramo-
lecular skeletal construction, proceed via (partial) dissociation of the capsule ( vide infra ). 
Consequently, guest exchange is often, but not always, more facile for non - covalent 
capsules compared to their covalent counterparts. Another advantage of non - covalent 
capsules can be the circumvention of tedious multistep syntheses that are necessary for 
the formation of covalent capsules. In this review we will focus on the chemistry taking 
place inside self - assembled capsules with closed cavities, however, one should keep in 
mind that the boundaries between capsules with open - and closed cavities are not always 
very clear. 
 Since the nineties of the last century, research groups around the world have explored 
the application of nanocapsules as nanoreactors, i.e. reaction vessels for chemical trans-
formations, and the inﬂ uence of different cavity effects.  11,12   In this chapter the focus will 
mainly be on recent developments concerned with synthetic nanoreactors that can be 
obtained in a selective and controlled manner through the use of self - assembly principles 
and rational design, and on their application as catalytically active capsules for respective 
chemical reactions. For the sake of clarity, each speciﬁ c type of nanoreactor will be dis-
cussed in a separate section. Particular types of nanocapsules to be reviewed include 
assemblies held together by hydrogen bonding, metal - ligand interactions and hydrophobic

effects. At the end of the chapter we will shortly address some recent developments in 
the application of micellar and vesicular self - assembled structures. 
 6.3  Encapsulation Effects in Catalysis 
 It is important to realize that the selectivity of a reaction is a matter of relative reaction 
rates between competitive pathways. Also the isolation (or trapping) of otherwise instable 
reaction intermediates by encapsulation and issues such as product inhibition can be 
explained in terms of reaction rates as this is a matter of changing the relative rate of a 
sequence of reaction steps. It is of great relevance to understand how the rate equation 
of a reaction changes when the process takes place inside the capsule. 
 6.3.1  Encapsulation Effects in Terms of Rate Equation 
 In order to understand encapsulation effects of chemical processes, the rate equation 
should be analyzed rather than making a comparison with enzymes. For a simple bimo-
lecular reaction where substrates A and B are giving product C (Equation  6.1 ) the general 
rate equation can be used (Equation  6.2 ). If reactions take place inside a capsule, substrate 
encapsulation and product release in - and - out of the nanoreactor (NR) should be taken 
into account, resulting in a more complex rate equation as all three events have to be 
considered (Equation  6.3 ). In an ideal case where the reaction between A and B inside 
the nanoreactor (NR) is the rate - determining step, the rate equation simpliﬁ es analogously 
to Michaelis – Menten kinetics and depends solely on the rate - constant of this step, i.e.  k b , 
and on the capsule concentration with the encapsulated substrates (NR    ⊃  A  •  B) (Equation 
 6.4 ). 13   In terms of energy proﬁ les these equations can be translated to the energy diagrams 
depicted in Figure  6.1 a.

 The rate - constant  k  is a function of the thermodynamic activation parameters i.e. the 
Gibbs free energy of activation (  ∆ G # ) and hence the activation enthalpy (  ∆ H # ) and the 
activation entropy (  ∆ S # ) via the Eyring and Arrhenius equations:   ∆ G #  =   ∆ H #  –  T  •   ∆ S #  
=  – RT(lnk)  +  c. (T  =  temperature, R  =  gas constant, c  =  a constant). Two extreme sce-
narios can be distinguished when reactions take place inside a capsule (a practical situa-
tion might be a combination of the two): 
  1.     The nanoreactor does not alter the activation parameters (i.e.   ∆
∆
G
G
NR
bulk
#
#
=
) and the 
only effect to be expected is the effect of physically bringing substrates together. In 
essence, the reaction goes from a bimolecular to an intramolecular reaction pathway. 
Since the activation parameters in equations (2) and (4) are the same, the rate constant 
remains the same,  ka  =  kb , and the difference in rate is due to the fact that 
[(NR  ⊃  A  •  B)]  >    [A][B]. In this chapter we have referred to this as  effective concen-
tration . 14   For a reaction that is carried out at a millimolar concentration, the increase 
in reaction rate will be a factor 1000 (using a millimolar capsule), whereas the increase 
in reaction rate at higher concentrations is much smaller. At extremely high substrate 
concentrations (above 1 molar) other issues will become important and the current 
simpliﬁ cation will no longer hold. 
  2.     The nanoreactor does change the activation parameters (i.e.   ∆

). Like 
enzymes, nanoreactors can  stabilize transition states (  ∆ G # ) of the reactions taking 
place in the capsule, which lowers the activation energy barrier (i.e.   ∆

of the reaction, as is depicted in Figure 1a.  15   Besides the obvious enthalpic stabilization 
( ∆ H # ) via non - covalent interactions between the transition state and the surrounding, 
entropy (  ∆ S # ) can also play a key - role in this stabilization. The speciﬁ c size, shape 
and chemical environment of the conﬁ ned nanospace  preorganizes encapsulated sub-
strates  towards the transition state by restricting their translational and rotational 
degrees of freedom and directing their orientation within the enclosed cavity. Generally, 
a precise ﬁ t between the cavity and the substrates results in a more effective preor-
ganization, reducing the potential negative entropy of a reaction. The cavity can also 
activate substrates by forcing them to adopt the most reactive conformation of those 
populated in the bulk, i.e. a statistical effect.  15 
 6.3.2  New Reactivities and Selectivities 
 The speciﬁ c size, shape and hydrophobic environment of the cavity as well as partly 
desolvation and isolation of the substrates from the bulk solvent can induce new activities 
and selectivities. 16 The new microenvironment within the nanoreactor can for example 
enforce the substrates to adopt conformations which are not or less populated in the bulk 
or it can stabilize certain reactive intermediates. In bimolecular reactions the cavity can 
direct the relative spatial orientation of the two substrates, facilitating selective reactions

by e.g. blocking bulk solution pathways that require an orientation which is not possible 
within the cavity.  17   Indeed, manipulation of reaction energetics and environment through 
encapsulation might provide access to reaction pathways which are otherwise inaccessible 
because of their high energy - barrier i.e. the energy landscape within the nanoreactor might 
be different from that outside. The former can be illustrated by considering a kinetic 
controlled reaction between A and B which can give two products: D and E. The speciﬁ c 
interactions between the nanoreactor and the encapsulated substrates can alter the reaction 
activation energy barrier   ∆ G #  of products D and E compared to the bulk. The transition 
state leading to product E can be stabilized upon encapsulation and thereby favouring its 
formation. In contrast, the transition state leading to product D can be destabilized upon 
encapsulation, thereby favouring the formation of product E (Figure  6.1 b). The former 
example describes a situation where the activity and selectivity of a reaction can be 
reversed upon replacing the bulk solvent with a nanoreactor. 
 Substrate size -  and shape - selective reactions can also be explained in terms of effective 
concentration and transition state stabilization. 1) In a mixture of substrates a higher 
concentration can be achieved for those having a complementary size and shape to the 
nanoreactor portals and cavity (and thus can enter the nanoreactor) compared to those 
substrates that can not easily enter or do not ﬁ t within the cavity. In some cases, when 
the substrate encapsulation is a slow process (slow diffusion), substrate encapsulation can 
become the rate - determining step. 2) One can also imagine that substrates of identical 
size and shape can both enter the cavity, but the transition state of one of the reaction 
pathways is stabilized to a greater extent than the other. Importantly, for all encapsulated 
reactions one should keep in mind that the substrate residence time within the nanoreactor 
and the kinetic rates of the encapsulated reaction should at least have a comparable 
magnitude. 18 
 For nanoreactors with an active site such as transition metal species, similar effects as 
described above can be expected.  19 – 21   The rate equation (Equation  6.4 ) is of course dif-
ferent and it might include the catalyst concentration. However, the principles remain the 
same: capsules can bring reactant and catalyst together or the activation parameters can 
be modiﬁ ed. Transition metal - catalyzed reactions consist of several steps, i.e. the catalytic 
cycle, with one of these steps being the rate - determining step. A transition metal - catalyzed 
reaction carried out in a restricted environment could change the rate - determining step of 
the catalytic cycle as a consequence of the change in activation parameters, resulting in 
new selectivities.  22   The cavity can also modify the structure of the encapsulated active 
site, giving rise to inherently different properties.  23,24   Similar to the above discussion, the 
second - coordination - sphere around the active - site can induce substrate size - , shape - , and 
regio - selectivities. Active - site encapsulation can also result in stabilization of the active 
site, which strongly interrelates to preventing catalyst decomposition. For transition metal 
catalysis this stabilization effect might be one of the driving forces towards application. 
 6.3.3  Product Stabilization 
 Nanoreactors might give rise to product inhibition when the nanoreactor has a higher 
afﬁ nity for the product compared to the substrate(s). Inhibiting product release prevents 
a catalytic turnover or at least lowers the reaction rate. In the case of product inhibition, 
the encapsulated product, i.e. (NR    ⊃    C), is very low in energy and the barrier for product

Molecular Encapsulation
release from the nanoreactor cannot be overcome (Figure  6.1 a). This higher preference 
for the product can be enthalpic, e.g. the product has multiple attractive interactions with 
the host. Entropic disadvantages in bimolecular reactions arise from the need to replace 
a single product by two substrates, which can also contribute to product inhibition effects. 
In some cases, product inhibition can be circumvented, for example by implementing a 
follow - up (domino) reaction with the product to yield a compound which exhibits lower 
afﬁ nity for the nanoreactor.  15   Product inhibition is occasionally observed in metallo - cages 
when the product is too large to leave the nanoreactor through its portals. This steric 
barrier can be overcome by using a less constrained, more open shaped nanoreactor or 
by aiming for products that are too small to cause product inhibition.  17 The reverse has 
been shown for H - bonded capsules, where formation of compounds with dimensions 
larger than the  ‘ side - pockets ’  of the capsule enforce a (partial) disrupture or opening of 
the structure to allow for guest exchange.  25   Interestingly, product inhibition can also be 
used for the stabilization of reactive intermediates or labile products that are otherwise 
difﬁ cult to isolate and analyse.  26   The stabilization of reactive intermediates can provide 
new information on mechanism of the particular chemical reaction. 
 6.4  Hydrogen Bonded Capsules 
 Hydrogen bonds can be typiﬁ ed as weak, non - covalent interactions that are highly 
directional and dynamic, all of which make them ideally suited as a motif for the con-
struction of supramolecular capsules. If properly designed, and even when using a non - 
stoichiometric mixture, solvation of the respective building blocks will lead to the spon-
taneous and instantaneous formation of such hydrogen bonded assemblies, albeit in a 
dynamic fashion, displaying fairly high rates of dissociation and recombination compared 
to e.g. coordinative interactions. As a result of this, and dependent on the speciﬁ c multi-
plicity of the H - bonding motifs present in the supramolecular system, the lifetime of the 
resulting capsules can range from microseconds to hours.  27 – 29   Capsule assembly is induced 
by encapsulation of appropriate guests (templating agent), which can be solvent molecules 
or speciﬁ c guests. Rebek and co - workers have shown that optimal guest occupation is 
approx. 55% of the available volume of the cavity.  30 However, stable self - assembled 
capsules with guests that occupy much more or less than 55% of the volume exist as well. 
Most H - bonded capsules do not have sizeable apertures for guest exchange and conse-
quently guest exchange occurs via partial or complete rupture of the capsule structure, 
depending on the properties of the host, guest and solvent. The residence time of the guest 
within the capsule is in the order of milliseconds to hours. H - bonded capsules are stable 
in apolar organic solvents such as dichloromethane and mesitylene while competitive 
solvents like DMSO and water lead to capsule dissociation. 
 Rebek and co - workers have developed the cylinder - shaped capsule  A . 27 – 29 This capsule 
consists of two self - complementary vase - shaped cavitands, i.e. resorcinarenes, substituted 
with four imide - functionalities on their upper rim (Figure  6.2 a). The cavitands dimerize 
in solution into the cylindrical capsule  A upon the formation of a seam of eight bifurcated 
hydrogen bonds (i.e. sixteen H - bonds). Capsule  A  has a cylindrical cavity with an internal 
volume of  ca . 425  Å 3 . The cavity contains a gradient of polarity and shape along its length 
and accommodates elongated guests. The capsule can simultaneously encapsulate two

different guests, i.e. selective pairwise recognition, such as one molecule of benzene 
together with one  p  - xylene molecule, which can be of interest for coupling reactions. 
During guest exchange two ﬂ aps of the capsule open, allowing guest exchange without 
capsule dissociation. 
 6.4.1  Stoichiometric 1,3 - Dipolar Cycloaddition 
 Rebek and co - workers have applied the cylindrical capsule  A  as a nanoreactor for the 
1,3 - dipolar cycloaddition between phenylazide  1  and phenylacetylene  2 (Scheme  6.1 ). 31 
Nanoreactor  A  simultaneously encapsulates reagents  1  and  2  to give [ A  ⊃  1  •  2 ] (this 
notation denotes that  A  encapsulates  1  and  2 ) next to the homo combinations [ A  ⊃  12 ] 
and [ A  ⊃  22 ] which are formed slightly less than the statistical distribution would predict. 
It was already shown that the cylindrical cavity of  A constrains the orientation of the 
guest molecules in an edge - to - edge fashion, so that their substituents are forced to interact. 
The cycloaddition within nanoreactor  A  results exclusively in the 1,4 - triazole after several 
days at millimolar concentrations. In contrast, the reaction in the absence of  A produces 
a 1   :   1 mixture of regioisomeric products of 1,4 -  and 1,5 - triazoles and has a half - life of 
several years. The observed rate enhancement is explained by an effective concentration 
of 3.7 M within  A . The high regioselectivity results from preorganized orientation of the 
substrates within  A , imposed by the nanoreactor boundaries. Nanoreactor  A  has also been 
shown to impose substrate size selectivity; the encapsulated cycloaddition between the 
larger azides 1 - naphthyl azide or 4 - biphenyl azide and phenylacetylene was not acceler-
ated. The system suffers, as expected, from product inhibition and therefore stoichiomet-
ric amounts of  A  have to be used. The product could be liberated upon addition of DMF 
resulting in denaturation of the capsule. 
 The  ‘ softball ’  capsule  B  (Figure  6.2 b), also developed by Rebek and co - workers, is 
composed of two multi - ring structures having a bridged bicyclic centrepiece and two 
glycoluril units on both ends of the multi - ring, providing proper rigidity, curvature and 
functional groups necessary for capsule assembly (Figure  6.2 b).  27 – 29 The self - complemen-
tary glycoluril - based building blocks dimerize in solution into capsule  B  due to the forma-
tion of a seam of sixteen hydrogen bonds.  ‘ Softball ’  B  is a closed - shell capsule of roughly

spherical shape with an internal volume of  ca . 400  Å 3 . The  ‘ softball ’  can simultaneously 
encapsulate two different guests such as one molecule of deuterated benzene together 
with one molecule of deuterated monoﬂ uorobenzene. Guests encapsulation occurs by 
opening of two separate ﬂ aps of the  ‘ softball ’  and subsequently departure of the guest as 
the incoming guest approaches, i.e. a gating mechanism. 
 6.4.2  Catalytic Diels – Alder Reaction 
 Rebek and co - workers have used  ‘ softball ’  B  as a nanoreactor for bimolecular Diels –
 Alder reactions. 25 The Diels – Alder reaction between  p - benzoquinone ( 3 ) and cyclohexa-
diene  4a  within nanoreactor  B , present in stoichiometric amounts, has been accelerated 
170 - fold compared to the bulk and resulted in the encapsulated adduct [ B  ⊃  5a ] (Scheme 
 6.2 a). Even though nanoreactor  B enhances the rate of the encapsulated reaction, no true 
catalytic behaviour was observed because of product inhibition by  5a . After encapsulating 
two quinones  3 within  B , one molecule is occasionally replaced by a thiophene dioxide 
 4b , which leads to the encapsulated Diels – Alder product  5b . Product inhibition is partly 
suppressed if thiophene dioxide derivative  4b  is used as the diene (Scheme  6.2 b). This is 
because two molecules of the  p - benzoquinone ( 3 ), i.e. [ B  ⊃  ( 3 ) 2 ] have a higher afﬁ nity 
for nanoreactor  B  than derivative  5b , the corresponding Diels – Alder product of the thi-
ophene dioxide. After each turnover the encapsulated product is released and replaced by 
two quinone reactants and true catalysis can take place. When catalytic amounts of  B (10 
mol%) are used, a tenfold rate enhancement (at 10 mM substrate concentration) compared 
to the background reaction was observed, which is still lower than can be expected on 
the basis of the effective concentration.     
 6.5  Capsules Based on Metal – Ligand Interactions 
 Metal – ligand interactions are strong and highly directional and lead to the self - assembly 
of robust stable coordination cages.  32 Kinetically labile metal - ligand (M – L) interactions

are essential for converting initially formed kinetic products to the more stable thermo-
dynamic product. Therefore appropriate conditions should be applied for the assembly of 
M – L based capsules in high yields. The metal coordination geometry in combination with 
multidentate organic ligands are used as codons for curvature. The preorganized and rigid 
nature of the ligands results in stable and well deﬁ ned capsules with cage - like architec-
tures. Unlike H - bonded capsules, guest exchange in and out of the coordination cages 
occurs by expansion of the cage apertures without M – L bond rupture.  33 Consequently, 
the size and shape of the cage apertures function as a gate keeper as they dictate the 
permitted size and shape of the guests. Besides the encapsulation of substrate molecules 
to facilitate certain conversions, also catalytically active metal centres can thus be encap-
sulated. Indeed sufﬁ cient space should be available to allow the transformation of encap-
sulated substrates at the active site.  
 6.6  Tetrahedral Cages Based on Octahedral M 3+ Ions 
 Raymond and co - workers have developed the chiral tetrahedral [M 4 L 6 ] 12 −  coordination 
cage  C  consisting of four metal ions with an octahedral coordination geometry, e.g. Ga 3+ , 
and six naphthalene - based bis - bidentate catechol amide ligands (Figure  6.3 ). 19 
 The metal ions are situated at the corners of the tetrahedron and the ligands span the 
edges of the tetrahedron. The tris - bidentate chelation of the metal atoms renders them 
chiral (  ∆  or   Λ ), and the mechanical coupling between the metals through the rigid ligands 
results in the exclusive formation of the homochiral assemblies   ∆ , ∆ , ∆ , ∆  and   Λ , Λ , Λ , Λ . 
Resolution of both enantiomers by means of selective precipitation upon association with 
the chiral cation  S - nicotinium was recently described. 34 The desired M 4 L 6 stoichiometry 
with a tetrahedral shaped cage is achieved by the presence of an appropriate guest

template during the assembly process such as   NR4
+ (R   =   Me, Et, Pr). The highly negatively 
charged tetrahedral cage is soluble in water and other polar solvents and contains a hydro-
phobic cavity of  ∼ 300 – 500  Å 3 . The highly anionic character of the cage allows for exclu-
sive encapsulation of monocationic guests such as alkylammonium ions and cationic 
organometallic complexes such as [CpRu(C 6 H 6 )]  +  (Cp  =   η 5 - C 5 H 5 ). Recently, tetrahedral 
nanocages with even larger interior voids have been assembled by the group of Raymond, 
through modiﬁ cation of the ligand backbone, using binaphthyl as the central framework 
instead of the formerly employed mononaphthyl skeleton. Calculated inner volumes in 
excess of  ∼ 700  Å 3  were reported, leading to favourable encapsulation of guests such as 
tetraphenylphosphonium ions.  35 
 6.6.1  Hydrolysis 
 The tetrahedral coordination cage  C  has been used by Raymond, Bergman and co - workers 
as a catalyst for the acidic hydrolysis of orthoformates in basic solutions.  36 This is an 
example where the inner phase facilitates reactions that are not possible in the exterior 
environment. Nanoreactor  C  has a much higher afﬁ nity for monocationic guests over 
neutral guests. Addition of neutral and even weakly basic compounds such as amines, 
phosphines and orthoformates, HC(OR) 3 , to aqueous solutions of  C  resulted in encapsula-
tion of their protonated form. The protonation is thermodynamically driven by stabiliza-
tion of the protonated species. Hydrolysis of orthoformates involves a protonated 
intermediate. Indeed catalytic amounts of  C  (1 mol %) in basic solution (pH 11) gave 
rapid hydrolysis of orthoformates to the corresponding formate esters, HC(O)(OR), which 
is subsequently hydrolyzed by OH  −   to formate,   HCO2
− (Scheme  6.3 a). Product inhibition 
is not taking place and the empty nanoreactor  C  can re - enter the catalytic cycle like a 
true catalyst. Rate accelerations of up to 890 - fold were observed for tris(isopropyl)ortho-
formate. As expected, nanoreactor  C  exhibits substrate size selectivity and only orthofor-
mates smaller than tripentyl orthoformate are readily hydrolyzed.

Chemistry in Self-Assembled Nanoreactors 
155
 A mechanistic study of the catalytic reaction has revealed a catalytic cycle in which 
the neutral orthoformate is ﬁ rst encapsulated within nanoreactor  C (Scheme  6.3 b). 
Protonation of the encapsulated substrate, presumably by deprotonation of water, results 
in the stabilized monoprotonated orthoformate. Subsequently, two successive hydrolysis 
steps within  C  liberate two equivalents of the corresponding alcohol. Finally, the proto-
nated formate ester is ejected from  C  and is further hydrolyzed by OH  −   in solution. The 
shift in the effective basicity of the encapsulated guests compared to the free analogue is 
four orders of magnitude, typically also found for enzymes that modify basic properties 
of the encapsulated substrates. This example is clearly based on stabilization of the transi-
tion state by interactions between the capsule and the encapsulated transition state. The 
mechanism of the encapsulated reaction involves an initial pre - equilibrium step followed 
by a ﬁ rst - order rate - limiting step. This Michaelis – Menten kinetics is parallel to enzymatic 
pathways. An inhibition study with   NPr4
+, a strongly interacting but reversible guest 
for  C , has revealed that the encapsulated hydrolysis reaction exhibits competitive 
inhibition. 
 The unimolecular Aza - Cope rearrangement of ally  15,19 and propargyl 37 enammonium 
cations within nanoreactor  C was also investigated by Raymond, Bergman and co -
 workers. The former reaction was catalyzed by 13 mol % of  C  and a rate acceleration of 
up to 850 - fold was observed, whilst with propargyl enammonium cations, the substoi-
chiometric [3,3] - sigmatropic rearrangement was found to be enhanced up to a factor of 
184 in the presence of nanocage  C . Since this is an intramolecular reaction, it represents

a clear - cut example in which the capsule preorganizes the substrate to reduce the entropic 
contributions to the activation energy. The nanoreactor induces substrate size -  and shape -
 selectivity and acts as a true catalyst, since release and hydrolysis of the iminium product 
circumvent product inhibition. 
 Raymond and co - workers have encapsulated cationic transition metal complexes such 
as [Cp * (PMe 3 )Ir(Me)(C 2 H 4 )] +  and [(PMe 3 ) 2 Rh(COD)] +  within their tetrahedral coordina-
tion cage  C via non - directional, non - covalent bonds (Figure  6.4 ). 38,39 Concerning the 
former, the group of Raymond in conjunction with Bergman and co - workers have studied 
the thermal C – H bond activation of aldehydes and ethers by an Ir(III) - complex encapsu-
lated within nanoreactor  C . This encapsulated iridium complex [ C  ⊃  Ir - complex] induced 
highly speciﬁ c substrate size and shape selectivities. However, product inhibition has 
prevented this system to achieve catalytic turnover.  19,38 
 6.6.2  Allylic Alcohol Isomerization 
 More success was garnered when the cationic rhodium complex [(PMe 3 ) 2 Rh(COD)] + , 
encapsulated within the tetrahedral coordination cage  C , was used as an isomerization 
catalyst for allylic alcohols (Table  6.1 ).  39   The size selection by nanoreactor  C only 
allowed encapsulation of the catalyst precursor [(PMe 3 ) 2 Rh(COD)] +  and not the PEt 3 -
 equivalent. The encapsulated precursor was hydrogenated to give the encapsulated active

2], i.e. [ C  ⊃  6 ], which remained encapsulated for 12 h. 
[ C  ⊃  6 ] is not the thermodynamic product as longer reaction times result in release of  6 
from the capsule. Therefore, the application of [ C  ⊃  6 ] is restricted to fast reactions such 
as allylic alcohol isomerisation, where substrate entrance and product release are rapid 
and occur prior to active site release. In contrast to the non - encapsulated catalyst  6 , the 
encapsulated catalyst [ C  ⊃  6 ] only isomerized small allyl alcohols (Table  6.1 , entries 
1b – 3b). Encapsulation within nanoreactor  C  imposes two - fold substrate selectivity, i.e. 
size -  and shape - selectivity, to the active site. The origin of this dual - selectivity lies in the

deﬁ ned apertures of the cage, which inhibit inclusion of larger branched substrates. 
Terminal substituted crotyl alcohol inhibits the catalyst (Table  6.1 , entry 4a), as is con-
ﬁ rmed by the simultaneous addition of both allyl alcohol and crotyl alcohol to the non -
 encapsulated catalyst  6 , which did not result in isomerization of either substrate. However, 
addition of both allyl alcohol and crotyl alcohol to [ C  ⊃  6 ] led to selective isomerization 
of the allyl alcohol. Hence, nanoreactor  C  protects the encapsulated catalyst  6 against 
decomposition and poisoning of the complex. 
 Using a slightly different approach, Hupp and co - workers have described the assembly 
of an open box structure, encapsulating a Mn(III) - porphyrin via direct metal - ligand inter-
actions between the guest molecule and the host structure.  20   The open box is based on 
four Zn(II) - porphyrins coordinated to four [Re(CO) 3 Cl] complexes via their pyridyl 
ligands. The encapsulated Mn(III) - porphyrin appeared to be a stable and selective epoxi-
dation catalyst. Although the open box type assemblies are somewhat beyond the scope 
of this chapter, it is important to realize that these more open assemblies can also provide 
interesting catalysts.

such as 2,4,6 - tris(4 - pyridyl) - 1,3,5 - triazine ligand in a 6   :   4 relative stoichiometry, sponta-
neous self - assembly results in the formation of octahedral nanocage  D , as described by

Fujita and co - workers (Figure  6.5 ). 40,41 By a slight adjustment in the architecture of the 
linking unit, i.e. employing 2,4,6 - tris(3 - pyridyl) - 1,3,5 - triazine, and using the same rela-
tive ratio of 6  :  4 (M  :  L) the related half - open, square - pyramidal cage  E was formed. 
 Within these aggregates, the corners of the octahedron are deﬁ ned by the metal com-
plexes, whereas the faces of the octahedron are occupied by the planar tripodal ligand 
scaffolds. As a consequence of the use of neutral donor ligands, the resulting hexanuclear 
complex carries a high overall positive charge and thus shows appreciable solubility in 
aqueous media, featuring a hydrophobic inner environment. As a result, these cages are 
very suitable hosts to accommodate a range of neutral and anionic guest molecules, 
including ferrocene and adamantane. Guest exchange can take place via the relatively 
large pores of the host. The large inner cavity has a diameter of approx. 2.2   nm and allows 
encapsulation of one to four guest molecules per cage, depending on the guest size. The 
coordination cage  D  can selectively recognize two different guests, such as one anthra-
cene - type molecule and one maleimide - type molecule, in a pair - wise manner. Remarkably, 
no external guests are needed in order to selectively form the Pd - based octahedral cage 
and the cage can be prepared at large scale (up to 50 g). This indicates that also polar 
solvents such as water can be included under judicious conditions. The Fujita group has 
reported many other types of cage structures, but cage  D  has been mostly used as reaction 
vessel. 
 6.7.1  Diels – Alder Reaction 
 The octahedral coordination cage  D  described by Fujita and co - workers has been applied 
as a nanoreactor for bimolecular Diels – Alder reactions in water.  17 Suspending

near - stoichiometric quantities of  D resulted in the selective formation of [ D  ⊃  7  •  8a ] 
(Scheme  6.4 a). Upon warming the reaction mixture, the Diels – Alder product  9a formed 
in excess of 98% and could be subsequently isolated by extraction with chloroform. The 
nanoreactor induces unusual regioselectivity by promoting reaction at the terminal anthra-
cene ring to give the syn - 1,4 - Diels – Alder adduct  9a , while reaction in the bulk solvent 
yields the product bridging at the central anthracene ring, the 1,9 - Diels – Alder adduct, in 
44%. The unusual stereo -  and regioselectivity observed for the encapsulated Diels – Alder 
reaction are explained by the ﬁ xed orientation of the two substrates within  D , preventing 
interaction at the 9,10 position of the anthracene  7 . This is an example where preorganiza-
tion within the nanoreactor prevents the energetically most favoured product. However, 
product inhibition by strong complexation of  9a within  D prevents catalytic turnover. 
 Interestingly, the Diels – Alder reaction of the anthracene  7  and  N - phenylmaleimide  8b 
could be performed in a catalytic fashion using 10 mol % of a square - pyramidal bowl  E . 
In this reaction the conventional regiochemistry of the 1,9 - Diels – Alder adduct  9b (Scheme 
 6.4 b) was obtained, but in excellent yield (99%), whereas without the nanoreactor present, 
only 3% conversion was observed under the same conditions.  17 Bowl  E  does not suffer 
from product inhibition because its open structure allows facile guest exchange (no kinetic 
traps), and the afﬁ nity for the substrate and product is based on aromatic stacking, which 
is more pronounced for the substrate than for product  9b . It is unknown if the rate 
acceleration is caused by effective concentration and/or transition - state stabilization. 
Remarkably, nanoreactor  D  can also efﬁ ciently promote the Diels – Alder reaction of 
highly stable and relative inert aromatic molecules such as triphenylene and perylene with 
 8a  to give the corresponding  endo Diels – Alder adduct with  syn  stereochemistry in high

yields. 42   The steric demand of the  N - cyclohexyl group on  8a  is important as it directs the 
orientation of the substrate within the cavity of  D . 
 6.7.2  Oleﬁ n Photodimerization 
 The octahedral coordination cage  D  has been used by Fujita and co - workers as a 
nanoreactor for the bimolecular [2+2] photodimerization of oleﬁ ns. 43 Suspending bulky 
oleﬁ ns such as acenaphthylenes  10a  or  10b  in an aqueous solution of  D  resulted in 
complexes [ D  ⊃  ( 10a ) 2 ] and [ D  ⊃  ( 10b ) 2 ], respectively (Scheme  6.5 a). Isolation and 
irradiation of these complexes yielded the encapsulated  syn - dimers [ D  ⊃  11a ] and 
[ D  ⊃  11b ] in  > 98%. The products were isolated by extraction with chloroform. Compared 
to the non - encapsulated photodimerization of  10a  in benzene, the nanoreactor acceler-
ated the reaction and improved the stereoselectivity for the  syn - dimer  11a  from 53% 
to 100%. In addition, the nanoreactor protected the encapsulated product  11a against 
photodissociation. Photodimerization of the non - symmetrically substituted 1 - methyla-
cenaphthylene  10b  can yield up to four different isomers. Under standard conditions, 
however, no dimerization occurs due to the steric hindrance of the methyl group, but 
photodimerization of  10b  within nanoreactor  D  does occur with a high stereo -  and 
regioselectivity, as is demonstrated by the exclusive formation of the head - to - tail 
 syn - dimer  11b . 
 The cross - photodimerization reaction represents a great challenge because it requires 
 D  to selectively recognize two different oleﬁ ns in a pair - wise fashion prior to irradiation, 
whereas the cross - coupling reaction under standard conditions shows no preference over 
the homo - coupling. The cross - photodimerization of acenaphthylene with substituted 
naphthoquinones within  D  resulted in exclusive formation of the cross syn - dimer only

for 5 - ethoxynaphthoquinone, while the less steric oleﬁ ns, having no substituent or a 
5 - methoxy group, yielded mixtures of homo -  and heterodimers (Scheme  6.5 b).  44 In addi-
tion, even relatively inert polycyclic aromatic compounds such as pyrene, phenanthrene 
and ﬂ uoranthene were selectively [2+2] cross - photodimerized with  N - cyclohexylmaleimide 
within  D , resulting in high stereo -  and regioselectivity.  42   Again, the steric demand of the 
 N  - cyclohexyl group of the maleimide is essential, as less sterically demanding groups 
were not reactive in the photodimerization with pyrene. 
 Subsequent work has established the formation of chiral derivatives of nanoreactor  D 
through the use of chiral diamine end - capping groups instead of ethylenediamine as ligand 
on the Pd building blocks and subsequent self - assembly with functionalized triazine 
frameworks. These chiral nanocages are able to remotely control the chiral [2+2] photo 
addition of ﬂ uoranthenes and several maleimides, a reaction previously unknown to be 
performed in an asymmetric fashion, in up to 50% ee. 45 
 Substrate desolvation and the hydrophobic environment within the cavity create a  new 
inner phase  for new applications. Indeed, the water - soluble nanoreactor  D  with a hydro-
phobic cavity has been used as phase - transfer catalyst for Wacker oxidation of styrene in 
an aqueous phase.  46   Another interesting feature of nanoreactors is their molecular frame 
that can play an active role during reaction of encapsulated molecules. For example, the 
triazine ligands of Fujita octahedral cage  D  can be photochemically excited; subsequent 
electron transfer from an encapsulated alkane (i.e. adamantane) to the cage induces sub-
strate oxidation by O 2  (or H 2 O, depending on reaction conditions), via the intermediacy 
of an adamantyl radical and the triazine - based radical anion of cage  D . 47 Also, the pho-
tochemical cyclization of diphenylethanedione, concomitant with effective suppression 
of photolytic cleavage of the substrate was reported to be enhanced by nanoreactor  D . 48 
Photomediated 1,4 - radical additions to quinones are another example where the con-
strained enclathration of substrate molecules in  D  enforces unusual reactivity.  49 No 
mention was made on the potential interaction or involvement of the photoactive cage -
 faces (the triazine scaffolds) in the latter two cases. 
 As mentioned previously, nanoreactors can also stabilize  in - situ  generated reactive 
intermediates and labile products like in the oligomerization of trialkoxysilanes within  D , 
which could not be isolated in the absence of this nanoreactor.  26 
 6.8  Hydrophobic Effects as the Driving Force for the Self - Assembly 
of Nanocapsules 
 Gibb and co - workers have used water - soluble cavitands that self - assemble into capsule 
 F . The assembly process is based on hydrophobic effects (and possibly on non - directional 
 π – π  stacking between the two building blocks) and the capsule formation occurred only 
in the presence of hydrophobic guests that function as template. 50 
 The template plays an important role in the formation of capsule  F  because no direc-
tional non - covalent bonds such as H - bonding and M – L interactions are involved in the 
self - assembly process. In addition, an external hydrophobic template is necessary because 
aqueous solvent does not template the formation of  F . Capsule  F  consists of two octa -
 acid, deep - cavity cavitands with a pseudo - conical hydrophobic cavity (Figure  6.6 a). The 
eight carboxylic acid groups are located at the periphery of the cavitand, thereby inducing

Molecular Encapsulation
high water - solubility under basic conditions. The cavitands dimerize upon encapsulation 
of complementary hydrophobic templates, e.g. a rigid steroid or two smaller alkanes 
(Figure  6.6 b). As mentioned above, the capsule is also held together by non - directional 
 π – π  stacking interactions between the aromatic rings on the wide hydrophobic rim of the 
two cavitands; therefore the structural integrity of these capsules is not ﬁ xed. Capsule  F 
has a calculated internal cavity of approx. 500  Å 3 . 
 6.8.1  Photooxidation 
 The cavitand - based capsule  F  has been applied by Gibb and Ramamurthy as a nanoreactor 
for the oxidation of methyl cycloalkenes by singlet oxygen to give allylic hydroperox-
ides. 50,51   Addition of a stoichiometric amount of ethyl cyclohexene  12  to the deep - cavity 
cavitand in a basic aqueous solution (which is necessary for capsule formation) resulted 
in formation of the host – guest complex, wherein nanoreactor  F  encapsulates two substrate 
molecules, i.e. [ F  ⊃    122] (Scheme  6.4 a). In the photooxidation reaction a singlet oxygen 
( 1 O 2 ) is added to the alkene bond and simultaneously one of the allylic hydrogens is 
abstracted, which can result in three different allylic hydroperoxides  13a ,  13b  and  13c 
(Scheme  6.6 a). Two different photosensitizers were used to generate singlet oxygen, 
namely the water soluble Rose Bengal (RB) or the water insoluble dimethyl benzil 
(DMB). In the later case, DMB was itself encapsulated within nanoreactor  F [ F  ⊃  DMB], 
 vide infra . Irradiation of [ F  ⊃    122] in the presence of photosensitizer RB or [ F  ⊃  DMB] 
yielded the allylic hydroperoxides  13a  and  13c  in 60 – 70% with 90 – 95% selectivity 
towards the regioisomer  13c . The products were isolated by extraction with chloroform.

photosensitizer RB) three hydroperoxides are formed,  13a (44%),  13b (20%) and  13c 
(36%). Thus, nanoreactor E exhibits very high regioselectivity in this particular oxidation 
reaction. NMR studies suggested that the methyl groups of the encapsulated substrates 
are anchored at the narrowest parts of the nanoreactor (Scheme  6.4 a). Hence, the encap-
sulated substrate is oriented such that singlet oxygen is prevented from approaching the 
methyl group. It is important to note that it is very difﬁ cult to control selectivity in reac-
tions with singlet oxygen. In addition, the NMR studies also support the observations that 
the allylic hydrogen H 3  of  12  is the most accessible of the three allylic hydrogen sets (H 3 , 
H 6  and H 7 ). Interestingly, nanoreactor  F  also stabilizes the product because the encapsu-
lated hydroperoxides [ F  ⊃  132] remained stable for weeks. 
 A very interesting aspect of this study is the use of the photosensitizer dimethyl benzil 
(DMB). This photosensitizer does not dissolve in water, unless it is encapsulated within 
nanoreactor  F , [ F  ⊃    DMB] (Scheme  6.6 b). It is important to notice that when [ F  ⊃  DMB] 
and [ F  ⊃    122] were mixed no guest exchange was observed and the capsules remained 
independent. The oxidation reaction of  12  involving [ F  ⊃    DMB] starts with the generation 
of excited DMB, i.e. [ F  ⊃     * DMB]. Next, the former nanoreactor opens and allows contact 
between oxygen and  * DMB, resulting in the formation of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ). In a 
subsequent step, the singlet oxygen diffuses from [ F  ⊃  DMB] to [ F  ⊃  122], resulting in 
regioselective oxidation of  12 . This system has properties related to those important for 
biological signaling. 52

 6.9  Ligand Template Approach Using Lewis Acid/Base Interactions 
 Our own work in the area of supramolecular self - assembly and the application of cap-
sular structures for catalytic conversions has dealt mainly with the introduction and 
application of ligand - template approaches as a new strategy for the encapsulation of 
transition metal catalysts.  21 – 24,53   The template ligands have a bifunctional character in 
that they contain functional groups for capsule assembly as well as a donor - atom site 
for metal coordination. This results in the encapsulation of the metal within the ligand -
 template capsule. Tris(pyridyl)phosphines, P(Py) 3 , are privileged template ligands as the 
nitrogen atoms of the pyridyl groups selectively and strongly coordinate to Zn(II) -
 porphyrins or Zn(II) - salphens, [Zn], resulting in the ligand - template capsule  G , i.e. 
P(Py) 3  •  [Zn] 3 (Figure  6.7 a). 
 The zinc building blocks create a hemispherical capsule around the tris(pyridyl)phos-
phine. Subsequently, the phosphorus atom can coordinate to a transition metal such as 
Rh or Pd, resulting in selective encapsulation, i.e. [ G  ⊃    Rh or Pd] (this notation denotes 
that  G  encapsulates Rh or Pd). Addition of the zinc building blocks to the rhodium - 
bis - tris( meta - pyridyl)phosphine - complex, Rh(P( m - Py) 3 ) 2 (CO)(acac), creates sterical hin-
drance around the encapsulated metal and results in the facile dissociation of one of the 
two pyridylphosphine ligands to give [P( m - Py) 3  •  [Zn] 3  ⊃  Rh(CO)(acac)] i.e. [ G  ⊃  Rh(CO)

(acac)] (Figure  6.7 b). The encapsulated rhodium catalysts were shown to have unusual 
reactivity and regioselectivity in the hydroformylation reaction ( vide infra ). 
 We have also reported a ligand - template approach for metal encapsulation in which the 
ligand - template is an integrated part of the capsule.  54   This example involves a concave 
shaped bifunctional diphosphine ligand which can complexate a transition metal and also 
contains functional groups for capsule formation. Self - assembly of the tetracationic 
diphosphine ligand with a tetraanionic calix[4]arene leads to the formation of a reversible 
heterocapsule based on ionic interactions ( H ). Coordination of palladium to the template -
 ligand results in metal encapsulation [ H  ⊃  Pd – Ar] (Figure  6.8 ). 
 6.9.1  Hydroformylation 
 Transition metal catalysts encapsulated within the ligand - template nanoreactor  G , 
P(Py) 3  •  [Zn] 3 , have been applied to catalyze industrially relevant processes such as 
hydroformylation and Heck reaction. 22 – 24 Nanoreactor [ G  ⊃  Rh(CO)(acac)] encapsulates 
a Rh - species that contains only one tris( meta - pyridyl)phosphine ligand, P( m - Py) 3 , sur-
rounded by three Zn - porphyrins or Zn - salphens. Under syngas pressure (H 2 /CO), rhodium 
species like Rh(CO)(acac)P(Py) 3  transform into a complex of type HRh(CO) 3 P(Py) 3 , 
which is the active species for the hydroformylation reaction. In this reaction terminal 
alkenes are converted into linear and/or branched aldehydes, and the ratio of these prod-
ucts strongly depends on the speciﬁ c catalyst applied. Hydroformylation of 1 - octene by 
encapsulated rhodium, [ G  ⊃  HRh(CO) 3 ], resulted in a 10 - fold rate enhancement compared

to the non - encapsulated rhodium catalyst (Scheme  6.7 a).  23,24   In addition, the selectivity 
for the product has reversed; nanoreactor [ G  ⊃  HRh(CO) 3 ] containing Zn(II) - porphyrins 
provides 63% of the branched aldehyde compared to 26% observed for the non - encapsu-
lated species. The unusual selectivity and increased rate can only partly be explained by 
modiﬁ cation of the catalytically active species upon encapsulation. Indeed, upon encap-
sulation the rhodium complex goes from bisphosphine to monophosphine, which gener-
ally produces more branched aldehydes along with higher rates compared to the 
bisphosphine species. In addition, a part of the effect was ascribed to complete encapsula-
tion of the catalyst, as open cage analogues containing only two porphyrins instead of 
three, and which were shown to also have only one phosphine ligand coordinated to the 
rhodium, proved less active and less selective toward branched aldehyde.   
 An advantage of the ligand - template approach for capsule assembly is the possibility 
to modify the shape of the capsule by only minor changes of the template - ligand, as 
demonstrated by using either tris( meta - pyridyl) - or tris( para - pyridyl)phosphine. Addition 
of Zn(II) - salphen scaffolds to these two ligand templates resulted in selective formation 
of nanoreactors  G and  I , respectively (Scheme  6.7 ). 23 Hydroformylation of 1 - octene by 
the tris( meta - pyridyl)phosphine based nanoreactor [ G  ⊃    Rh] gave a preference for the 
branched aldehyde (Scheme  6.7 a), whereas the tris( para - pyridyl)phosphine based nano-
reactor [ I  ⊃    Rh] predominantly gave the linear aldehyde, as with the non - encapsulated 
Rh – bisphosphine complex (Scheme  6.7 b). These selectivities imply that nanoreactor 
[ G  ⊃    Rh] corresponds to a Rh – monophosphine complex whereas the more open structure 
of nanoreactor [ I  ⊃  Rh] allows the formation of Rh – bisphosphine species. 
 More recently, nanoreactor [ G  ⊃    Rh] has operated as a high - precision catalyst for the 
regioselective hydroformylation of internal alkenes.  22 The non - encapsulated complex 
HRh(P( m - Py) 3 ) 2 (CO) 2  yields a near statistical mixture of the two expected internal alde-
hydes 2 - methyloctanal and 2 - ethylheptanal. However, nanoreactor [ G  ⊃  Rh], encapsulat-
ing the Rh - catalyst, exhibits a strong preference to form 2 - ethylheptanal in 88% (Scheme 
 6.8 ). This outstanding selectivity is unprecedented in the hydroformylation of internal 
alkenes. A similar selectivity was found in the hydroformylation of 3 - octene. Experiments 
using various partial H 2  and CO pressures resulted to the proposition that the hydride 
migration is the selectivity - determining step. This step requires a rotation of the coordi-
nated alkene which is hampered by the steric restrictions imposed by the interior of the

capsule. Apparently, rotation of the intermediate oleﬁ n complex leading to the 2 - 
ethylheptanal product is more facile, explaining the observed regioselectivity. Therefore 
it can be concluded that the nanoreactor determines the regiochemical outcome of the 
reaction by imposing its sterical restrictions during a speciﬁ c step in the catalytic sequence. 
It is interesting to note that there are no other reactions that can distinguish between the 
two carbon atoms of 3 - octene, demonstrating that reactions carried out in nanoreactors 
can result in unprecedented selective reactions. 
 In related work, we have employed   α  - diimine ligands with pyridine functionalities in 
conjunction with our Zn - porphyrin self - assembly protocol to arrive at supramolecular 
ligands for the Pd - catalyzed copolymerization of styrene and CO.  55   It was shown that 
both the reactivity of the catalyst and the stereoregularity of the polymer formed can be 
controlled in a supramolecular fashion, by subtle changes of the building blocks involved 
in the catalyst assembly. These supramolecular catalysts among the most active and selec-
tive catalysts for this reaction, and the origin of the selectivity is currently being studied. 
It is hypothesized that the effective encapsulation of the metal center by the porphyrin 
units has a signiﬁ cant impact on the overall dynamics of the system. 
 So far we have not used the chromophoric character of the porphyrin building blocks, 
but we recently studied systems in which we capitalize on these light capturing devices. 
We reported a catalyst system that is formed by assembly, which is able to use light as 
primary energy source to generate molecular hydrogen (Scheme  6.9 ).  56 The primary bio-
mimetic [2Fe2S] hydrogenase catalyst is utilized with supramolecular handles to assem-
ble the light capturing chromophore in close proximity of the active diiron centre to 
facilitate the photo - induced electron transfer. Importantly, closely related [2Fe2S] com-
plexes with very similar electrocatalytic properties show a distinctively different behavior 
upon (photo)reduction. For this reason the supramolecular approach has been important 
as it enables the easy modular variation of complexes. In addition, we found an active

catalyst that is difﬁ cult to prepare by traditional strategies and which we did not predict 
in advance. Detailed studies show that in both experiments with complexes  14  the assem-
bly  14  •  ( 15a )( 15b ) is the active species formed, either directly or via light induced dis-
proportionation. The hydrogen producing system requires two different chromophores 
( 15a  and  15b ) present in solution, suggesting that  14  •  ( 15a )( 15b ) is an active species. 
This study reconﬁ rms the observation that small changes in the parent [2Fe2S] complex 
can result in different and unpredictable reaction pathways upon reduction. The supramo-
lecular approach is highly promising for further development in this important area, as 
the modular nature of the building blocks applied also facilitates rapid optimization. 
 6.10  Virus Capsids, Proteins and Micellar Systems 
 Several approaches have recently been developed that directly apply natural architectures 
for artiﬁ cial chemical reactions, some of which are detailed in different chapters of this 
book. Although not classiﬁ ed as homogeneous catalysis, the reduction of metal salts 
inside nanoreactors could be the ﬁ rst step on the way to reactivity with the corresponding 
metal colloids or nanoparticles in e.g. hydrogenation reactions. A variety of carrier 
systems have been studied lately, including virus capsids, polymeric micelles, mini -
 emulsions and hollow core - shell particles, as nanoreactors and hosts for the synthesis and 
encapsulation of well - deﬁ ned, stable nanoparticles. 57 
 Viruses and proteins such as ferritin or streptavidin 58 are large self - assembled micellar 
aggregates of bio - amphiphiles that naturally function as carriers for RNA. Removal of 
this RNA core yields the corresponding  apo  - capsids that can be further functionalized. 
Hence, apoferritin has been used as a container for the formation of Cu and Ag nanopar-
ticles, by reduction of corresponding metal salts inside the virus capsid interior.  59 Also 
Fe - nanoparticles have been synthesized in a controlled manner within the cavity of geneti-
cally engineered human H - chain ferritin protein.  60   The groups of Nolte and Cornelissen 
have published initial results on the use of virus capsids as nanoreactors for single enzyme 
catalysis. 61

 6.11  Micellar Systems 
 Catalysis inside micellar systems is an attractive approach that might also ﬁ nd application 
in recycling and recovery of homogeneous catalysts, which would enable introduction to 
continuous catalysis. Besides covalent approaches, using crosslinked, unimolecular 
micelles or latex particles and electrostatic interactions between the surfactant head 
groups and the cationic metal species,  62 non - covalent, dynamic micelles charged with 
catalytically active transition metal complexes have also been employed. Recent examples 
include the work by Weberskirch on the dual - catalyst hydroaminomethylation of 1 - octene 
in aqueous media through the use of phosphane - functionalized macromonomers. 63 
Reasonable n/iso ratios of up to 11 and turnover frequencies of up to  ∼ 600 h  − 1 were 
obtained. In a similar fashion, micellar systems derived from 2 - oxaline based amphiphilic 
block - copolymers, partially functionalized with Co – salen complex at the hydrophobic 
interior, were used for the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of epoxides in water.  64 Excellent 
ee ’ s for both the epoxide and the diol product were obtained, but catalyst recycling experi-
ments showed loss in selectivity after a few runs. The droplets present in speciﬁ c inverted 
(water - in - oil) mini - emulsions have been employed as nanoreactors to perform a polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR).  65   Micelles built - up in part from amphiphilic dendrons have been 
exploited as vessels for the aqueous - phase Diels – Alder addition reaction between C 60 and 
polycyclic hydrocarbons.  66   Inverted block - copolymeric micelles, featuring a poly(4 - vinyl-
benzoic acid) interior and a polystyrene corona in toluene, were utilized as hosts for 
Fe - bis(imino)pyridine based single - site alkene polymerization catalysis of ethene.  67 Rod -
 coil based amphiphiles, wherein the rod - fragment consisted of linear polyphenylene 
moieties and the coil - tail was represented by poly(ethylene glycol) chains, were shown 
to aggregate into micellar structures in water. The speciﬁ c architecture as well as the 
strict hydrophobic interior were shown to provide a good platform to perform the Suzuki 
coupling with standard aryl boronic acids and halides in water at room temperature 
at low catalyst loadings.  68   Our own group reported on functionalized, xanthene based 
diphosphine ligands that were decorated with surface - active pendant groups 
(i.e. - 4 - C 6 H 4 O(CH 2 ) n C 6 H 4 (SO 3 Na)), which spontaneously self - assembled into vesicular 
aggregates in water. These supramolecular structures proved stable even at elevated tem-
perature (90  ° C), so upon introduction of a suitable Rh - precursor, the selective aqueous 
biphasic hydroformylation of higher alkenes (e.g. octene), which typically show very low 
solubility in water, could be carried out, coupled with repetitive recycling of the catalyst 
system. 69 
 The groups of Rowan and van Hest have jointly reported on the use of polymersomes 
 –  enlarged liposomes with a vesicular structure containing a hydrophobic bilayer  – as 
nanoreactor vessels for a three - step cascade reaction.  70   The stepwise, controlled incorpo-
ration of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and glucose oxidase (GO) in separate inner -
 domains of the polymersome structure was conﬁ rmed by ﬂ uorescence microscopy. More 
speciﬁ cally, GO was selectively located inside the hydrophilic core enclosed by the 
bilayer, which itself contained HRP, whilst a third enzyme,  Candida antarctica  lipase B 
(CALB), was not encapsulated but was added to the bulk solvent surrounding the reactors. 
The following reaction sequence was studied as a proof - of - principle: i) conversion of 
1,2,3,4 - tetra - O - acetyl - β  - glucopyranoseglucose into glucose by CALB, ii) oxidation of 
glucose to the corresponding lactone concomitant with formation of H 2 O 2  by GO and iii)

lecular micelles, polymers and biomacromolecules the reader is referred to the recent 
review literature. 11 
 6.12  Conclusions and Outlook 
 A wide array of self - assembled molecular capsules based on various building blocks and 
non - covalent interactions has been developed in the last decade. The nanospace within 
these supramolecular capsules is generally in the range of 300 – 500  Å 3  (although larger 
examples are known as well), which is sufﬁ cient for the selective encapsulation of appro-
priately sized guest molecule(s). A number of distinctly different capsule architectures 
have been characterized, highly dependent on the speciﬁ c type of non - covalent interac-
tion, building block structure and templating agent, and as a result guest shielding and 
guest exchange rates can strongly vary. A diversity of chemical processes has been carried 
out within molecular capsules and the effects observed so far are, although academic, 
very interesting. Reactions can be  accelerated  and the  selectivity  of a chemical process 
can be changed completely. These observations can be explained by stabilization of the 
reaction transition state by the capsule (based on enthalpic and entropic contributions) or 
by concentration effects in the case of bimolecular reactions, such as Diels – Alder reac-
tions. More important are the unique reaction  selectivities  induced by the novel ﬁ nite 
microenvironment within the capsule. The size and shape of the nanoreactor ’ s cavity and 
that of the nanoreactor ’ s gates can control the substrate selectivity by controlling the 
access to the cavity. Similarly, a nanoreactor can protect an  active site  located in the 
cavity that otherwise would be poisoned by chemicals present in solution. The  regio - and 
chemoselectivities can also be changed by the capsule, through a change in the relative 
reaction rates of competing pathways. This was for example observed for encapsulated 
rhodium complexes that were used as hydroformylation catalysts. In addition to these 
effects, reaction  intermediates , that otherwise exhibit too short lifetimes for identiﬁ cation, 
have been observed as stable species in nanoreactors. In these cases the reaction rate of 
the subsequent step after the formation of the intermediate is slowed down by the nano-
capsule.  Product inhibition , which is a frequently encountered problem in bimolecular 
coupling reactions carried out within enclosed cavities, is fundamentally related to the 
former. The coupling product might have a higher afﬁ nity for the capsule than the sub-
strates, and consequently product release from the nanoreactor becomes the slowest step 
in the reaction. Also entropic factors might be important, as a unimolecular product has 
to exchange with two substrate molecules. Product inhibition can prohibit the utility of 
nanoreactors as true catalysts. 
 In addition to the nanoreactors discussed in this review, which are formed by assembly 
of at least two building blocks, capsules based on covalent bonds have also been applied 
as nanoreactors.  11   Such covalent nanoreactors were beyond the scope of the current 
review, but similar effects in catalysis are observed. However, self - assembled capsules 
also have guest exchange mechanisms via partial disassembly of the capsule, whereas 
exchange for the covalent analogues is restricted to portal slippage. It is this unique 
property that enables the combination of complete encapsulation with sufﬁ ciently rapid

in – out exchange, which might proof to be very advantageous for potential catalytic 
applications. 
 Although the research ﬁ eld is still in its infancy, several examples of reactions, wherein 
self - assembled nanoreactors are applied and are shown to dramatic enhance or alter reac-
tivity, have appeared, thereby demonstrating the power of the supramolecular concept. 
Detailed studies are required to fully understand the mechanisms behind the effects 
observed when carrying out reactions in nanoreactors. The results obtained so far sketch 
a bright prospective, as reactions have been observed that are unique to those carried out 
in capsules. In this review we have focussed on reactions that take place  inside  the cap-
sules. However, molecular capsules have also been used to control reactions that take 
place  outside  the capsule for example by controlling the release of reagents, making the 
nanoreactor applications virtually unlimited. 71

The Michaelis – Menten kinetics assumes that product release occurs rapidly (this assumption 
is also done in equation 4). However, this assumption does not always counts for nanoreactors 
because they can display product inhibition ( vide infra ).

 7.1  Introduction 
 7.1.1  Supramolecular Chemistry and Enzymes 
 Supramolecular Chemistry has been deﬁ ned as the chemistry beyond the molecule.  1 If 
you wish, any reaction, and especially catalysis, is a supramolecular phenomenon. The 
term supramolecular catalysis,  2   however, is used in a much more narrow sense. A good 
approach to avoid endless discussions on deﬁ nitions is to observe Mother Nature and look 
for supramolecular chemistry there. The molecular recognition of enzymes and their 
ability to catalyse numerous reactions with outstanding selectivities is a challenge for the 
(supramolecular) chemist. 
 What is so special about the enzymes? Which elements have to be copied if one wanted 
to construct an enzyme - like molecule? And what are the reasons to attempt a construction 
of an enzyme - like molecule? 
 Enzymes have been brought to perfection by billions of years of evolution. Nevertheless, 
enzymes for every conceivable reaction do not exist. A Diels – Alderase for instance has 
long been sought after, and even today there is dispute about its existence.  3 In addition, 
enzymes have been perfected in aqueous media, and usually only little variation in the 
solvent composition is possible. It is therefore attractive to copy the features of enzymes

and to construct artiﬁ cial molecules which may operate in any solvent and which may 
carry out reactions Nature has not taken into her reservoir of techniques. 
 For such enzyme - like molecules, two central features of an enzyme have to be imitated. 
First, there is a reactive site  –  the active site. This active site consists of one or more 
functional groups which, in many cases, may also carry out the same type of reaction if 
they are not part of an enzyme. But the selectivity, and also often the reactivity, will not 
be the same. Responsible for this aspect is the second important feature of enzymes, the 
embedding of the active site in the three - dimensional structure of the protein. The polypep-
tide backbone forms helices, sheets and other suprastructures which usually build up 
clefts, caves or niches in which the active site is located. This sterical shielding usually 
is responsible for the fascinating selectivities of enzymatic reactions. 
 The active site itself may just consist of the functional groups of the proteinogenic 
amino acids, or additional co - enzymes can be embedded. Many of them contain metal 
ions, and thus the enzymes can be divided into metallo - enzymes and metal - free ones. In 
the laboratory, bio - inorganic chemistry and organocatalysis try to understand and repro-
duce these two classes. 
 In this chapter, the geometric features will be the guide to enzyme - inspired artiﬁ cial 
systems. The vast majority of substrates have a shape which resembles that of a potato. 
In other words, their overall shape is convex and irregular. For a selective recognition of 
a surface, a multipoint interaction is necessary. Because the substrate is convex, the rec-
ognition region of the enzyme has to be concave which is ensured by a cleft or cave type 
geometry (see above). Host – guest recognition has been discussed since Emil Fischer  4,5 
established the lock - and - key principle. More elaborate models discuss ﬂ exible ﬁ t and 
induced ﬁ t, and conformational ﬂ exibility is essential in this context. But adaptability 
does not result in a loss of the concave shape. One way to ensure a general concave 
structure is the use of macrocycles, and another approach is to employ stiff subunits. The 
latter is realized in cleft molecules, also termed pincers, and within the group of macro-
cycles, especially bimacrocycles ensure concavity because they enclose the void in three 
dimensions. 
 For a reagent or a catalyst, a reactive functional group is needed. Inspired by the struc-
ture of enzymes, the functional group must be located in the concave region. The chal-
lenge is an  endo - functionalization. In 1987, 6   we presented the concept of concave reagents

in which we compared the geometry of a concave reagent with that of a light bulb in a 
lamp shade (Figure  7.2 ). The lamp shade represents the concave shielding, the light bulb 
the functional reactive group within this concave conﬁ nement. Next, the macroscopic 
features have to be translated into the nano - world. The rim of the lamp shade is a cycle, 
and in order to let molecules or part of a molecule pass, it must be macrocyclic. Then, 
the functional group must be placed above this entry which means that the macrocycle 
must be spanned by an additional bridge carrying the functional group. The last task is 
to ensure that the functional group remains in an  endo - position, and a lamp - like molecule 
is completed. 
 By turning the bimacrocycle upside - down, our concave concept was termed some years 
later as reaction bowls.  7   Functional groups including less stable ones such as a sulfenic 
acid, a selenenic acid, and a monosubstituted simple enol have been incorporated in 
cyclophanes and bridged calixarenes 8 (for an example see Figure  7.15 ). 
 7.1.2  Reagents and Catalysts 
 Over the past decades, numerous reactions have been carried out inside supramolecular 
complexes. In a large number of examples, no additional functional group was present in 
the cavity but the conﬁ nement and often the electrostatic potential was responsible for 
reactivity and selectivity. In contrast,  endo  - functionalized reagents and catalysts are active 
due to the embedded functional group. 
 Early examples for the ﬁ rst group of reactions are those in which a charge is developing 
or a charge is redistributed. Schmidtchen ’ s 9   tetrahedral trimacrocyclic tetracationic recep-
tors for instance accelerate the decarboxylation and ring opening of a benzisoxazole

its inside and can only be touched by a molecule with matching size and shape

(Figure  7.3 ) while Dougherty ’ s 10 anionic,   π  - rich macrocycles catalyse the alkylation of 
quinoline by stabilizing the charge in the transition state (Figure  7.4 ). 
 In the past decade, self - assembled cages have been made accessible for instance in the 
groups of Raymond,  11 Fujita 12 or Stang 13  . The resulting host molecules have now been 
used to catalyse reactions related to the ones mentioned above (Diels – Alder, 12 see Figure 
 7.5 , 3,3 - sigmatropic rearrangement, 11 see Figure  7.6 ). 
 In other host molecules, binding sites are located in such a way that the substrates or 
reagent and substrate are bound in proper proximity within a host molecule. The proximity 
is entropically favorable for a reaction and thus rate accelerations have been observed. In 
addition, the proper placement of the reactants leads to altered selectivities. For instance 
Sanders 14   described a macrocyclic trimeric porphyrin in which two substrates are preor-
ganized in such a way that the stereochemistry of a Diels – Alder reaction is governed by 
the inclusion (see Figure  7.7 ). 
 But most related to enzymes are those concave entities in which reactive functional 
groups are pointing inwards. Several subclasses can be identiﬁ ed: there are reagents and 
catalysts, and these can be divided into metal - containing and metal - free compounds.

Molecular Encapsulation
 In the case of a reagent, a functional group is altered in the course of the reaction. An 
acid for instance can carry out a protonation which results in the corresponding base at 
the end of the reaction. Or a redox - reagent oxidizes or reduces a substrate and alters its 
redox state. This is a problem for expensive reagents like concave ones, and therefore 
recycling is essential in these cases (but easy to carry out in case of protonations/depro-
tonations or redox - reactions). 
 In catalysis, however, the catalyst is unaltered after each catalytic cycle. This means 
that much less material is needed if the catalysis has a good turn - over and that a recovery 
is possible, at least in principle. 
 Concave reagents have been employed in many reactions but for the reasons mentioned 
above, most of the reactions were catalyses. Besides acid or base catalyses, especially 
transition metal ion catalysed reactions are of interest and have been investigated. The 
following chapters will ﬁ rst present major classes of concave reagents and will then 
discuss some reactions and catalyses and the inﬂ uence of the concave shielding on rate 
and especially selectivity. 
 7.2  Classes of Concave Reagents 
 The ﬁ rst 6   examples for concave reagents were bimacrocyclic concave pyridines with the 
general structure shown in Figure  7.8 . A 2,6 - disubstitution of the pyridine was chosen in 
order to ensure the  endo  - position of the pyridine nitrogen atom ’ s lone pair. Later, the 
framework of the bimacrocycle has been changed,  15   and in principle, several approaches 
to concave pyridines, and to concave reagents in general, can be envisioned.

 7.2.1  Strategies for the Construction of Bimacrocycles 
 For a concave reagent with a lamp - like geometry, at least a bimacrocycle has to be con-
structed. Let us discuss a pyridine - containing bimacrocycle (see Figure  7.9 ). The synthetic 
task can be accomplished by two subsequent macrocyclizations with a monomacrocyclic 
intermediate (see Figure  7.9 , left and right), or in a double macrocyclization which gives 
the desired bimacrocycle from a non - macrocyclic starting material in one reaction step 
(see Figure  7.9 , middle). The two step reaction can be subdivided into two approaches. 
Either the pyridine is part of the starting material from the very beginning (Figure  7.9 , 
right), or a pyridine - free macrocycle is spanned by a pyridine - containing bridge (Figure 
 7.9 , left). 
 Although at ﬁ rst glance, the one - pot reaction may seem to be advantageous, all three 
methods have their pros and cons. In a double macrocyclization, two reactive ends are 
needed for the closure of each bridge, i.e. a total of four reactive ends exist in the precur-
sor. This implies a selectivity problem in the macrocyclization, because not only the 
desired bimacrocycle may be formed, also a  bis - monomacrocycle whose structure resem-
bles that of an earmuff is conceivable (see Figure  7.10 ). For several different classes of 
concave reagents, this problem has been investigated, but fortunately, only in the case of 
very long chains, the formation of an  ‘ earmuff ’  is a problem.  17 Therefore, many concave 
reagents may efﬁ ciently be built up using this strategy. 
 If the two - step syntheses for bimacrocyclic concave reagents are compared with one 
another, the use of a pyridine - free macrocycle as the starting material seems to be attrac-
tive because numerous macrocycles are easily available, some of which can even be 
purchased. Consequently, for instance calixarenes  18   have been spanned with pyridine (and 
other) bridges.  19   Although a very powerful ligand for a copper(I) catalyst has been found

using this approach (see below),  20   the strategy is limited because the size of the starting 
macrocycle is preassigned in cases such as calixarenes or cyclodextrins. In the case of 
the bridged calixarenes, only the calix[6]arene derivative could be synthesized in good 
yield. 19   The respective calix[4] derivative did not form at all,  19   the calix[5] one was 
formed in low yield,  21   and with calix[8]arene, regioisomers were formed.  21 Furthermore, 
a ﬁ ne - tuning of the size of the macrocycle is not possible. 
 Therefore, also the third approach is useful. By synthesizing macrocyclic diamines ﬁ rst 
which were then bridged by a pyridine (or other) bridge, a large variety of bimacrocycles 
were formed and minute changes in the length and composition of the bridges were pos-
sible (see Figure  7.8 ). 6,16 
 Thus a pool of concave reagents has been made available using one or another of these 
three general strategies. Some of these molecules have been attached to dendrimers or 
polymers to allow easier recovery.  22,23 
 7.2.2  Ring - closure 
 The formation of macrocycles is well established but not as straightforward as the syn-
thesis of a ﬁ ve - or six - membered ring. 24 The latter ones possess almost no strain and are 
therefore formed much more easily than strained three -  or four - membered rings or 
medium size rings. However, macrocycles which contain more than twelve atoms usually 
are unstrained, too, still their synthesis is more difﬁ cult. The major competition to mac-
rocyclization is oligo -  and polymerization, and thus a number of methods had to be elabo-
rated to produce macrocycles in good yields. Two classes of syntheses must be 
distinguished: syntheses under thermodynamic control, and kinetically controlled ones. 
In a kinetically controlled macrocyclization, the rate of polymerization and cyclization 
differ in the reaction order. While (macro)cyclization is a unimolecular, ﬁ rst - order reac-

tion, oligo -  or polymerization take place between  two  molecules and thus these reactions 
are second - order in concentration of the precursors (see Figure  7.11 ). The latter reactions 
are therefore slowed down proportional to the square of the dilution while the macrocy-
clization of a single molecule is dilution independent. The respective rate only decreases 
linearly with dilution. This has been exploited by the high - dilution principles,  25 and 
several modiﬁ cations thereof have been worked out [e.g. one - component, two - component 
dilution, syringe pump technique]. The strong point of the kinetic control is the fact that 
a macrocycle, once it is formed, remains a macrocycle. 
 This is not the case in a thermodynamically controlled reaction. Thermodynamic 
control means that all compounds in the reaction mixture are in equilibrium, they con-
stantly are interconverted into one another. The relative ratio of the products depends on 
the relative thermodynamic stability of each compound. If the desired macrocycle is the 
most stable compound, ﬁ ne, but how can the concentration of a macrocycle be increased 
when it is not the global most stable product? It has to be forced to be a more stable 
compound. This can be done by adding an additional component which interacts with the 
desired macrocycle in such a way that the resulting complex is the most stable 
compound. 
 Such an approach uses the template effect, and by carefully adjusting the template to 
the macrocycle, the number of stabilizing interactions between the template and the 
desired product can be maximized while the number of interactions with starting materials 
or oligo -  and polymers is smaller due to a lesser amount of complementarity (see Figures 
 7.12 and  7.13 ). 
 The ﬁ eld of dynamic combinatorial chemistry  26   takes advantage of the template effect,  27 
and numerous macrocycles have been stabilized by a proper template.  28,29 Also for the 
construction of macrocycles for concave reagents, the template effect is very valuable.

Already in the beginning of the history of concave reagents, the template effect of metal 
cations was utilized,  6   but also organic molecules can be applied. Sanders  30 for instance 
used the interaction of pyridines with zinc porphyrins in the construction of macrocyclic 
oligomeric porphyrins, and recently, the interaction between polyols and boronic acids 
has been used in order to synthesize new  endo - functionalized macrocycles (Figure  7.14 ). 31 
 Which reactions are useful for a ring - closing reaction? In principle, all reactions can 
be used. All irreversible reactions may be used in kinetically controlled cyclizations. 
However, it is advisable to use reactions which possess a decent reaction rate because the 
dilution and the potentially slow addition of one or more starting material to the reaction 
mixture lead to long reaction times anyway. Prominent reactions used for kinetically 
controlled macrocyclizations are nucleophilic substitutions as for instance found in 
Williamson ether syntheses (for an example see the product shown in Figure  7.10 ) or the 
formation of amides from acid chlorides and amines (see Figure  7.8 ). 
 For a dynamic combinatorial templated reaction, a reversible reaction is needed. 
Preferentially, a reaction is chosen whose reversibility can be switched on and off at wish, 
for instance by temperature or pH change or by the addition (and later removal or inhibi-
tion) of a catalyst. Also subsequent fast reactions can scavenge the macrocyclic reaction 
products. Prominent examples  26   for reversible reactions in macrocycle syntheses are 
disulﬁ de exchange, ester exchange, both pH controlled, ruthenium catalysed ring - closing 
metatheses or the formation of hydrazones and imines, the latter one usually being scav-
enged by reduction of the imines to respective amines. 
 7.2.3  Concave Acids, Bases and Ligands 
 Bimacrocycles synthesized by one of the strategies described above may contain func-
tional groups of different nature. First, basic centres were introduced,  6,15 – 17,19,32,33 next, 
complementary concave acids  34,35   were realized, and third, the lone pairs of the bases were 
utilized to coordinate a catalytically active metal ion.  17,36,37   But in principle, any kind of 
reactive group can be placed into the concave environment.  38   Just recently, the ﬁ rst 
concave N - heterocyclic carbenes have been realized. 39,40 Figures  7.15 – 7.21 summarize 
several classes of concave reagents and catalysts. As can be seen easily from the ﬁ nal 
structures, the different strategies yield products of different complexity. When a calix-
arene is spanned by a bridged or a tetrafunctionalized non - macrocyclic precursor is 
doubly cyclized, products with higher symmetry are formed than in the case of a stepwise

synthesis which starts from the building block containing the reagent. In addition, isomers 
may be formed such as conformers (in the case of carboxamides  6,16 ),  cis / trans - mixtures 
(when ring - closing metathesis 31,41   is used) or even regioisomers (when a larger calixarene 
such as calix[8]arene 21 is bridged). 
 As mentioned above, the objective of the concave shielding of a functional group in 
a concave reagent is selectivity: chemo - , regio - , diastereo -  and especially enantioselec-
tivity have to be controlled. To inﬂ uence the latter, chiral concave reagents are necessary. 
The usual way to turn a non - chiral compound into a chiral one is to add a stereogenic 
center, typically an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom. If applied to concave mol-
ecules there are two possible regions to attach it to. If attached to the inside of the 
cavity, the void becomes chiral but is ﬁ lled to a large part by this chiral substituent. But 
if attached to the outside, the concave inside remains mostly unaltered. Therefore axial 
chirality has been envisioned because it desymmetrizes the cavity without ﬁ lling it up. 
Biaryls are conﬁ gurationally stable if they are unsymmetrically substituted with

 7.3  Reactions and Catalyses 
 As presented in the introduction, concave reagents can be used as reagents or as catalysts. 
As reagents they will be  ‘ used up ’  with the need of recycling, as catalysts they can carry 
out numerous catalytic cycles and can be recovered from the mixture. 
 7.3.1  Reagents 
 Due to the simple recycling, acid - base reactions, i.e. protonations or deprotonations, have 
been carried out successfully with concave reagents. There is no need to differentiate 
between acids and bases because for instance a protonated pyridine can transfer a proton 
in the same way as for example a carboxylic acid can. Much more important is the acidity 
of the corresponding acids. Respective p K a  values for the deprotonation have been deter-
mined in water (per deﬁ nition) but many reactions are carried out in various organic 
solvents (which is a strong point of concave reagents, see introduction).  47 The inﬂ uence 
of the solvent on acidity very often is enormous but at the same time this difference is 
frequently underestimated. If for instance the solvent water is exchanged by ethanol, the 
p K a  - analogous values of pyridines in ethanol hardly differ from the p K a  values in water.  16 
But for carboxylic acids, a drastic drop of several orders of magnitude can be observed 
when exchanging water by ethanol.  35   Consequently, less polar or even non - protic solvents 
may have an even more drastic effect on the relative acidities. In the pyridinium - carbox-
ylic acid comparison,  16,35   the discrepancy is extreme because for a pyridinium ion a charge 
is lost upon deprotonation while a carboxylic acid develops a charge when the anion is 
formed. And the less polar a solvent is, the more is the equilibrium shifted towards the 
uncharged particles, the base in the case of pyridine, the acid for carboxylic acids. 
 In protonations and deprotonations there are two fundamentally different pathways 
by which the proton can be transferred: the general and the speciﬁ c protonation. 48,49 The 
terms general and speciﬁ c have been coined for acid - catalysis  48   but they can be used 
for proton - transfers in the same sense.  49  General  means that generally (i.e. always) the

proton is transferred by the same particle, explicitly the protonated solvent. In contrast, 
a  speciﬁ c  protonation is carried out by a speciﬁ c proton donor, for instance a pyridinium 
ion or a carboxylic acid. A change in the proton source will therefore only have an 
inﬂ uence on the outcome of a protonation if the general protonation pathway is avoided. 
At ﬁ rst glance, the solution to this problem is the use of a hardly basic solvent and an 
acid of moderate acidity. However, there is a second problem in selective protonations. 
If the proton source shall have an inﬂ uence on the selectivity, the protonation must be 
kinetically controlled. A thermodynamic control would produce the more stable protona-
tion product and the protonating acid will ﬁ nally have no inﬂ uence on the product 
distribution. Unfortunately, the chance for a thermodynamically controlled protonation, 
an equilibrium, rises with increasing basicity of the corresponding base, and therefore 
a ﬁ ne balance must be found between acidities and basicities of all involved compounds. 
This may be the reason why only few examples exist for selective protonations, includ-
ing enantioselective ones.  50   In the case of concave reagents, concave proton donors have 
been used to carry out the Nef reaction under mild conditions  51   and for some stereose-
lective protonations. 52 
 7.3.2  Catalysts 
 Besides the use as a reagent, concave reagents can be used in a catalytic fashion. From 
the vast possibility of potential reactions, so far nucleophilic catalyses and metal catalyses 
have been investigated with several types of concave catalysts. 
 7.3.2.1  Organocatalysis 
 For nucleophilic catalyses, concave pyridines, concave 1,10 - phenanthrolines and concave 
NHC can be used. However, the substitution pattern which ensures the  endo - placement 
of the nucleophilic lone pair does not allow all kinds of nucleophilic catalyses. Pyridine 
and especially its more basic sibling DMAP [4 - (dimethylamino)pyridine] are excellent 
catalysts for acyl transfers. However the pyridine ’ s catalytic power drops enormously 
when substituents are added to the 2 -  and 6 - position.  53   A reaction which demands less 
space is the formation of a hydrogen bond to the lone pair of the nitrogen, and thus 
catalyses via hydrogen - bond formation are easily possible with concave pyridines. 
Speciﬁ cally, the activation of an alcohol by the formation of a hydrogen bond to the lone 
pair of a pyridine nitrogen atom in a concave environment has proven to be very valuable 
for selective acylations of these OH groups. An activated alcohol adds much faster to a

the acid H - A (speciﬁ c protonation) or the protonated solvent Solv - H + (general 
protonation). Only in the case of a speciﬁ c protonation can the acid inﬂ uence selectivity 
in the protonation step. But even in this case, a reversibility of the protonation, due to the 
basicity of the conjugate base of the acid, can ruin the controlled speciﬁ c protonation. In 
this latter case, the thermodynamically most stable protonation products will be observed

ketene than a free alcohol. Thus the use of pyridine, or related bases, can speed up the 
addition of alcohols to for instance diphenylketene. This ketene has been chosen because 
it is reactive enough in this addition reaction but still stable enough to be handled in 
normal laboratory practice.  54   This reaction allows to distinguish numerous alcohols,    17b,23,54 – 56 
and in the case of a glucose derivative with two very similar OH groups, one of them 
may be acylated in high yield exclusively. The concave shielding of the pyridine allows 
to discriminate between two secondary axial OH - groups (Figure  7.24 ). 56 
 More recently, concave NHC have been investigated as nucleophilic catalysts.  57 The 
catalytic potential of NHC is well known since Breslow  58   elucidated the mechanism of 
thiamine dependent enzymes.  59   With aldehydes, NHC may catalyse the benzoin condensa-
tion in the same way, a cyanide ion can. But when additional substrates are added, the 
nature of the NHC becomes important.  60   Thus, in a mixture of aldehydes and enals, two 
competing pathways may be catalysed and either so called Stetter products (for instance 
1,4 - diones) or   γ  - lactones can be formed (Figure  7.25 ). Using one particular concave NHC,

 7.3.2.2  Metal Catalysis 
 Probably the largest catalytic potential lies in the metal complexes of concave reagents. 
Two sub - structures are well established as metal ligands: 1,10 - phenanthroline and NHC. 
Numerous transition metal complexes have been synthesized  36,37,61,62   and some of them 
have been investigated in metal catalysed reactions such as Lewis - acid catalysed Diels –
 Alder reactions, 36 palladium - catalysed allylations, 63 and copper(I) - catalysed cyclopropa-
nations. 20,41,64   In the latter reaction, the full potential of concave reagents and the 
importance of the ﬁ ne structure of the concave shielding has become obvious. With two 
different types of concave ligands, two complementary stereoselectivities have been 
found. 
 When copper(I) catalysed, indene for instance reacts with diazoacetates to give either 
 exo - or  endo - cyclopropanes (see Figure  7.26 ). 20 The distinct difference in the selectivities 
achieved by using different concave 1,10 - phenanthrolines lies in the different geometry 
of the ligands. 
 In 2,9 - diaryl - 1,10 - phenanthrolines (see Figures  7.10 and  7.20 ), bridgeheads and 
1,10 - phenanthroline unit are connected directly, leading to a rather stiff entity. The active 
centre, the copper ion bound to the nitrogen atoms of the 1,10 - phenanthroline can only 
be reached from  ‘ below ’  through the bimacrocycle. In the cyclopropanation, the active 
species is a copper - carbenoid. When the alkene approaches it, the substituents of the 
alkene and the carboxylate of the carbenoid try to avoid sterical compression within the 
cavity and take up maximal distance to one another. Thus, the  exo - product is formed with 
high selectivity. 
 In contrast in the bridged calixarene (see Figure  7.15 ), the methyleneoxy units between 
the 1,10 - phenanthroline and the calixarene act as ﬂ exible joints and this leads to a differ-
ent geometry in which the 1,10 - phenanthroline bridge is tilted towards one chain of the 
calixarene rim. The calixarene macrocycle is too small to accommodate the carboxylate 
or to let an alkene approach the carbenoid. This results in an orientation in which both, 
the alkene and the carboxylate residue of the carbene moiety, have to be squeezed in the 
gap between the 1,10 - phenanthroline and part of calixarene rim. By this sterical shielding 
of the calixarene, the carboxylate and the residues of the alkene are oriented next to each 
other, and thus the predominant formation of the  endo - product is observed. 64b

 The last decade has shown the increasing importance of N - heterocyclic carbenes as 
ligands for transition metals. In many complexes, the stabilization of special oxidation 
states of a transition metal is even better by a NHC than by phosphines, 65 the second 
generation of Grubbs ’  catalyst being a prominent example.  66   Also with concave NHC, 
many complexes can easily be prepared,  37,62   and some of them have been applied to 
catalyses. 62 Copper complexes may be used for cyclopropanations, too, but yet with 
smaller selectivities than 1,10 - phenanthrolines exhibit. With palladium however (see 
Figure  7.21 ), cross - coupling reactions such as Heck or Suzuki couplings can be carried 
out with good efﬁ ciency (Figure  7.27 ). 62 
 7.4  Summary and Outlook 
 The features of enzymes  –  active centre and concave shielding  –  have been combined 
in (usually) bimacrocyclic synthetic molecules. The resulting concave reagents can be 
used as reagents or preferentially as catalysts. In several reactions as for instance acyla-
tions or cyclopropanations, the concave reagents have demonstrated their selectivity -
 determining power. In current research, ﬁ rst chiral concave reagents have been 
synthesized and it is the task for the future to optimize the structures and to establish 
enantioselective reactions and catalyses. The similarity between concave reagents and 
enzymes, besides all advantages, produces one drawback. Indeed, by optimizing the 
concave geometry, selectivities can be tailored, but as with enzymes, a perfect reagent -
 substrate match leads to the problem that the optimized catalyst is only perfect for the 
substrate it was optimized for. In enzyme chemistry there exists an exaggerated saying: 
 ‘ one enzyme, one substrate ’ . In this respect, concave reagents cannot surpass enzymes. 
The higher the selectivity, the smaller is the substrate tolerance. But concave reagents 
can be made from any starting material. The backbone of the bimacrocyclic structure 
is not restricted to amino acids. And thus concave reagents can be made more robust, 
for any solvent, for higher temperatures. In addition, also the functional groups are not 
restricted to those found in enzymes. The guideline for the future is therefore: try to

copy the excellency of enzymes as much as possible but try to use optimized backbones 
and any functional group. 
 So far, most approaches to enzyme - like activity have used just one of the functional 
groups which are present in enzymes. However, many enzymes only operate by a coop-
eration of functional groups (see for instance the catalytic triade in peptidases). There, 
the enzyme ’ s functional groups perform a multifunctional catalysis. Therefore in (organo)
catalysis, bifunctional catalysis has been developed, too.  67 In the ﬁ eld of concave reagents, 
ﬁ rst bifunctional catalysts have been constructed (Figure  7.28 ),  41e   and future will tell how 
capable they are to catalyse reactions with their acidic  and basic functionalities.

 8.1  Introduction 
 Calixarenes are oligomeric cyclophanes derived from the condensation of phenols with 
formaldehyde. They became popular in the late seventies and have played a very impor-
tant role in Supramolecular Chemistry ever since, as witnessed by numerous books 1 and 
review articles  2   on the subject. Calixarenes are important building blocks for the prepara-
tion of a large variety of supramolecular complexes and materials, thanks to their ability 
to act as hosts, and the possibility of introducing a large number of functions at either 
rim by means of selective derivatization. 
 This chapter focuses on reactivity control in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions 
taking place in the conﬁ nes of supramolecular complexes of reactants with calixarene 
receptors. Earlier work on the subject was reviewed by us in 2000.  3 Quite recently, 
Homden and Redshaw have published an extensive review on the use of calixarenes in 
metal - based catalysis. 2i   Because of space limitations and, even more importantly, to avoid 
extensive overlap with the already reviewed material, the scope of this chapter is restricted 
to works treated only marginally, or not treated at all, in the above review article. The 
ﬁ rst section deals with examples in which reactivity control takes place via substrate 
inclusion into the calixarene cavity. The other section illustrates the use of the calix[4]
arene upper rim in the construction of di -  and trimetallic complexes capable of esterase 
and nuclease activity.

 8.2  Calixarenes as Hosts 
 The limited size of the calix[4]arene backbone allows deep penetration within its cavity 
of only small guests. Notably, Rathore, Kochi and co - workers  4   reported that the tetra -  O -
 methylated  p - tert - butylcalix[4]arene  1 (R − Me), upon oxidation in CH 2 Cl 2  followed by 
exposure to gaseous NO, or upon treatment with NOSbCl 6 , forms a dark purple, highly 
stable 1  :  1 complex ( K  >  5  ×  10 8  M  − 1 ), that shows no sign of decomposition for several 
months, both in solution and in the solid state. The X - ray structure showed that NO + is 
completely entombed in the cylindrical cavity of the 1,3 -  alternate  conformation.  1 H NMR 
spectroscopic evidence was obtained that in solution all four conformers ( cone ,  partial 
cone , 1,2 - alternate , 1,3 - alternate ) of the calix[4]arene host form complexes of deﬁ nite 
stability with NO + . The preference of 1,3 -  alternate  in the solid state indicates a crystal-
lization induced drainage of the equilibria in solution. Rudkevich  et al . 5,6 subsequently 
discovered that caged NO +  complexes of the same kind are reversibly formed upon bub-
bling NO 2 /N 2 O 4  through a chloroform solution of a tetra -  O - alkylated calix[4]arene ( 1 , 
R − Hex) ﬁ xed in the 1,3 - alternate conformation, in the presence of SnCl 4 (Equation  8.1 ). 
Quite remarkably, encapsulated NO +  was found to act as a highly selective nitrosating 
agent towards secondary amides. The reaction mechanism outlined in Scheme  8.1 is 
consistent with the observed size - shape selectivity and with the ﬁ nding that the chemical 
properties of encapsulated NO +  are different from those in bulk solution, and are control-
led by the calix[4]arene cavity. The reaction proved to be quite sensitive to the size of 
 – Alk, but not to that of  – Alk ′ . Fair to good yields (50 – 95%) of  N - nitrosated products 
were obtained only with  N  - methylated amides, independent of the size of  – Alk ′ from 
ethyl to heptyl. No reaction occurred with amides alkylated with  – Alk bulkier than methyl, 
on account of the hindered approach to the encapsulated NO + species.

 The wider cavity of calix[6]arene has been masterfully exploited by the group of 
Reinaud in the design of ligands that mimic the coordination sphere of the metal ion of 
copper enzymes.  7   A calix[6]arene functionalized at the smaller rim by three independent 
 N  - donor groups, upon binding to copper is constrained in a  cone  conformation. The free 
coordination site of the metal situated inside the calix[6]arene cavity is available for 
coordination to small donor molecules to afford the so - called  ‘ funnel complexes ’ . 8 
Structure  2  shows a funnel complex featuring a tris(pyridine) coordination site, a perfectly 
tetrahedral geometry for cuprous ion, and a CH 3 CN ligand embedded in the calix[6]arene 
cavity. A preliminary investigation of the electrochemical behaviour of a tris(pyridine) –
 calix[6]arene – Cu complex 9a   was extended to additional families of Cu – N 3 – calix[6]arene

complexes including tertiary amine and  N - alkylimidazole ligands. 9b The important dis-
covery was made that the electrochemical behaviour of the complexes could be resolved 
and analyzed in CH 3 CN, but not in non - coordinating solvents such as CH 2 Cl 2 and THF. 
The beneﬁ cial action of CH 3 CN was obviously ascribed to its ability to form funnel 
complexes. The supramolecular concept of the  ‘ shoetree ’  molecule guest was proposed. 
The  ‘ shoetree ’ CH 3 CN guest in the calix[6]arene cavity ensures the overall ﬁ xation of the 
coordination at every stage of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) reorganization process. As such, the  ‘ shoe-
tree ’ guest is a prerequisite for a dynamic redox behaviour. 
 Another family of calix[6]arene funnel complexes is provided by the calixtren ligand 
 3 . 10   Here a calix[6]arene is capped by a tren unit, thereby presenting a  N 4 coordination 
site at the end of a concave calix[6]arene core. Calixtren – Cu complexes are endowed with 
unique properties, when compared to all previously described tren – Cu complexes. The 
 3 – Cu(I) complex does not disproportionate in concentrated solution, and is stable in 
chlorinated solvents for days. Furthermore the  3 – Cu(II) complex is a strong receptor for 
neutral ligands, such as nitriles, alcohols and amides, but not for anionic ligands. This 
was ascribed to the strong electrostatic repulsion exerted by the lone pairs of the six 
oxygen atoms of the calix[6]arene core. Unlike the Cu(I) complexes of the calix[6]arene -
 based ligands equipped with tris(imidazole) or tris(pyridine) coordination sites, the cal-
ixtren - complexed Cu(I) centre in  3 – Cu(I), was found to be very sensitive towards O 2 
(Scheme  8.2 ), leading to a transient (CuO 2 ) +  species, whose nature was assigned as a 
reactive Cu(II) – superoxide adduct. In the presence of CH 3 CN, well suited for penetrating 
the calix[6]arene cavity and for stabilizing the Cu(II) centre,   O2
− is ejected from the 
complex into the reaction medium. Even more importantly, in a non coordinating solvent 
such as CH 2 Cl 2  the metal - bound superoxide species directly oxidizes a CH bond of the 
tren backbone, a result that has important implications for the modes of action of copper 
monooxygenases.

Molecular Encapsulation
 The  p - sulfonatocalix[n]arenes  4 , originally synthesized by Shinkai  et al . 11 as water 
soluble calixarenes for catalytic studies in water solution, were more recently used by 
Ueoka  et al . 12   as catalysts in the speciﬁ c acid catalyzed methanolysis of  N - Ac - l - amino 
acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp, His, Lys, Arg). Rates of methanolysis in the presence of the calix[n]
arene catalysts, normalized per sulfonic group, were compared with rates obtained in the 
presence of the noncyclic analogue  p - hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid. Rate enhancements 
 –  ranging from 12 -  to 86 - fold  –  relative to control were recorded only in the methanolysis 
of basic amino acid derivatives (His, Lys, Arg), but neutral amino acid derivatives (Phe, 
Tyr, Trp) responded virtually in the same way to the presence of cyclic and non - cyclic 
catalyst. Michaelis – Menten kinetics and  1 H NMR spectral evidence pointed to the inter-
mediacy of inclusion complexes of  4  with the protonated form of basic amino acid deriva-
tives, as shown in  5 for the His – 4 (n  =  4) combination. 
 
 
 Ditopic receptors  6  were designed and synthesized by de Mendoza  et al . 13a as mimics 
of the phosphocholine binding site of McPC603 antibody. Receptors  6  bind strongly to 
dioctanoyl -  l - α - phosphatidylcholine ( K  =  73000  M  − 1  for  6a and 95000  M  − 1  for  6b  in chlo-

roform, 25  ° C), as a result of a combined binding of the choline trimethylammonium head 
to the calix[6]arene subunit through cation – π  interactions, and of the anionic phosphate 
to the guanidinium subunit through ion pairing and hydrogen bonding. Since phosphate 
diesters are well known transition state analogues for the basic hydrolysis of esters, it was 
reasoned that receptors  6  would catalyze a B Ac 2 - type cleavage of choline esters. Indeed, 
the methanolysis of choline  p  - nitrophenyl carbonate (PNPCC), in CHCl 3 /MeOH 99  :  1 in 
the presence of diisopropylethylamine – perchlorate salt buffer at 25    ° C (Equation  8.2 ) was 
effectively catalyzed with turnover by  6 . 13b   A rate enhancement of 76 - fold relative to 
background was recorded in the presence of 1   mM  6a , and one of 149 - fold in the presence 
of 1  mM  6b . Kinetic analysis yielded maximum rate accelerations at saturation of 600 
and 1000 for  6a  and  6b , respectively. Much lower rate enhancements were brought about 
by equimolar mixtures of the disconnected subunits, showing that the two subunits in  6 
bind to the transition state  7 with considerable degree of synergism.
 
 
  (8.2) 
 A similar strategy of catalyst design based on ditopic receptors composed of distinct 
recognition elements for the reacting and non - reacting parts of the substrates, was adopted 
by the group of Rebek in a number of works involving reactions of choline or choline 
derivatives. In these studies, the recognition subunit for the choline trimethylammonium 
head is a cavitand derived from resorcinol.  14 Receptor  8  features a zinc(II) salophen unit 
fused to a resorcinarene. As suggested by an energy minimized structure, the trimethylam-
monium group of a PNPCC guest is well positioned deep within the cavity, whereas the 
ester carbonyl is simultaneously coordinated to the metal electrophile. In accordance with 
this picture, PNPCC has a very high afﬁ nity for  8 , much higher than that of choline. The 
complexed PNPCC undergoes basic hydrolysis in buffered CH 2 Cl 2  containing 0.01% 
water (Equation  8.3 ) no less than 50 times more rapidly than uncomplexed PNPCC. 
Consistent with a complexation catalysis scheme, the much less reactive acetylcholine 
acts as a competitive inhibitor in the hydrolysis of PNPCC. Complex cavitand  8  is also 
an effective catalyst for the acylation of choline. 15 Here the salophen - complexed metal

ion is believed to activate the incoming acylating agent toward nucleophilic attack from 
the cavitand - complexed choline hydroxyl. In the presence of 2   mol% of  8 , the reaction 
with acetic anhydride (Equation  8.4 ) takes place 1900 times faster than the background 
reaction. Acetylation is an order of magnitude slower when the zinc(II) – salophen complex 
and the cavitand unit are not covalently connected.

 As a variation on the theme, instead of a zinc(II) – salophen unit, receptor  9 16 features 
a 2 - pyridone unit, that is a known bifunctional catalyst for the rate limiting breakdown 
of the tetrahedral intermediate involved in the aminolysis of active esters in aprotic sol-
vents. Turnover catalysis was indeed observed when the reaction between propylamine 
and PNPCC (Equation  8.5 ) was carried out in CH 2 Cl 2 /CH 3 CN 99  :  1 in the presence of 
receptor  9 . It was estimated that the reaction inside  9  is  ca . 6000 times faster than the 
reaction in the bulk solvent.

groups, when deeply hosted in the cavity of  10 , position the maleimide carbonyl group 
in close proximity to the organized  H  - bonding network, whereas the double bond remains 
exposed above the receptor. The Diels – Alder reaction of the complexed maleimide with 
9 - anthracenemethanol (Equation  8.6 ) is strongly accelerated relative to the reaction of the 
uncomplexed reactant. This is believed to arise from interaction of the dienophile with 
the hydrogen bonding network at the cavitand rim. The hydroxyl of 9 - anthracenemethanol 
plays a role, because anthracenes lacking a hydroxyl group do not react. The increase in 
steric bulk of the reaction product causes fast release from its complex with  10 , thus 
ensuring high turnover efﬁ ciency with little or no product inhibition.

 Cavitand  10  was also found to stabilize the Meisenheimer complexes of S N Ar reactions 
of 2 - nitro - 4 - triﬂ uoromethylchlorobenzene with piperidine and its next higher homologues 
azepane (7 - ring) and azocane (8 - ring) in the non - polar solvent  p - xylene - d 10 (Equation 
 8.7 ). 18 The afﬁ nity for the host is low with piperidine ( K  =  14  M  − 1 ) and is somewhat higher 
with the larger rings ( K  =  40  M  − 1 ). When carried out in the presence of stoichiometric  10 , 
the reaction of piperidine with the activated aryl chloride shows a 12 - fold rate enhance-
ment relative to the control reaction. Seven -  and eight - membered cyclic amines, whose 
afﬁ nity for the host is somewhat higher, show accelerations of 67 - and 35 - fold, respec-
tively. These were proposed to arise from the ability of the polar amide groups at the 
upper rim to stabilize the anionic portion of the dipolar transition state, possibly combined 
with cation – π  interactions between the aromatic walls of  10  and the developing positive 
charge of the nucleophilic nitrogen.

more strongly ( K  >  4000  M  − 1 ), on account of cation – π  interactions between the hosted 
cation and the inner aromatic walls of the container molecule.  19   When hosted in the cavity 
of  11 , quinuclidine undergoes the Mentschutkin reaction with butyl halides and sulfonates 
CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 X in acetone solution (Equation  8.8 ) much more rapidly than uncom-
plexed quinuclidine, with rate enhancements of 1600, 1300, 150, and 100 for X   =   Br, Cl, 
Mes, Tos, in the given order. Product inhibition prevents turnover, and the reactions are 
not catalytic.

 Resorcinarene - based deep cavitands were also used by Rebek and coworkers to stabi-
lize and detect otherwise elusive reaction intermediates. The entropically favoured reac-
tion of primary amines hosted in the cavity of  12  with the introverted aldehyde functionality 
(Scheme  8.3 ) leads to previously undetectable hemiaminal intermediates, whose half - lives 
vary from 30  min to 100  h. 20   The nature of the stabilization arises from a combination of 
mechanical isolation from the medium, hydrogen bonding to the organized amide seam 
at the cavitand rim, and steric repulsion between the alkyl group and the cavitand wall 
occurring for the repositioning of the alkyl group when going from hemiaminal to imine, 
as schematically shown in Scheme  8.3  for the reaction of  i - propylamine. The hemiaminal 
derived from  i  - propylamine has a half - life of 135 minutes, whereas half - lives lower by 
an order of magnitude are observed for hemiaminals derived from unbranched pro-
pylamine and butylamine. The exceptionally long lifetimes of the hemiaminals derived 
from ethanolamine (t  ½   =  3520  h) and ethylenediamine (t  ½   =  5640  h) are due to further 
stabilization arising from intramolecular hydrogen bond.

 A similar strategy was adopted for the observation of elusive isoimide inter mediates.  21 
The reaction between a carboxylic acid and an aliphatic isonitrile in mesitylene - d 12 
(Equation  8.9 ) proceeds through an isoimide intermediate that rearranges to a  N -
 acylformamide (Mumm rearrangement). When cavitand  13  was reacted at millimolar 
concentrations with isopropyl isonitrile in mesitylene -  d 12 ,  1 H NMR peaks and IR bands 
arising from the isoimide intermediate were detected. Over the course of a few hours, the 
signals arising from the intermediate disappeared and were replaced by signals from the 
 N  - acylformamide product. Again, stabilization by supramolecular interactions and steric 
barriers to Mumm rearrangement due to restricted molecular motions in the interior of 
the cavity, explain the slow rate of decomposition of the isoimide intermediate.

 Molecular capsules are structurally elaborated receptors that completely surround the 
hosted molecule(s). Encapsulation based on covalent bonds yields permanent arrange-
ments of molecules - within - molecules. 22   Reversible encapsulation, on the other hand, is 
based on self - assembling through formation of weak supramolecular bonds and offers 
possibilities for a dynamic   in
out

 exchange of encapsulated molecules. Most of the 
dimeric capsules developed by Rebek and his group are obtained through reversible self -
 assembly of resorcinarene subunits. When simultaneously encapsulated in the cylindri-
cally shaped inner space of these capsules, two reactant molecules are temporarily isolated 
from others in solution and display reactivity features different from those in bulk solu-
tion. The matter has been extensively reviewed, 23 and will not be discussed here.

complexes. In many instances such dinuclear complexes have been obtained from homo-
ditopic receptors composed of two identical metal complexing units connected by a suit-
able spacer. The catalytic efﬁ ciency of these complexes is inﬂ uenced by a variety of 
factors, among which the nature of the spacer itself plays an important role. The use of 
either rim of calix[4]arenes as suitable spacers is well precedented.  3 Particularly success-
ful has been the use of the upper rim of calix[4]arenes blocked in the  cone conformation, 
that was pioneered by the group of Reinhoudt.  25   Dinuclear zinc(II) and copper(II) com-
plexes of ditopic receptors composed of two nitrogen ligand units at the diagonal position 
of a calix[4]arene scaffold, showed a high degree of catalytic cooperation of the two metal 
centres in the cleavage of phosphodiester bonds, as a result of a good compromise between 
preorganization and ﬂ exibility (dynamic preorganization).  25   Most recent investigations in 
this area, resulting from joint efforts involving the authors ’  group in Roma, Reinhoudt ’ s 
group in Enschede, and Ungaro ’ s group in Parma, are summarized in this section. These 
studies were aimed at widening the scope of the calix[4]arene scaffold in the construction 
of di - and trinuclear catalysts capable of esterase and nuclease activity. 
 8.3.1  Artiﬁ cial Esterases: Barium(II) Complexes 
 The basic ethanolysis of esters functionalized with a distal carboxylate anchoring group 
is catalyzed with turnover by dinuclear barium complexes according to the mechanism 
depicted in Scheme  8.4 . 26 The high afﬁ nity of carboxylate for the ligated barium ion 
ensures efﬁ cient binding of the ester substrate to the metal catalyst. The function of 
the anchoring step is manifold: it selects the substrate, provides a moderate electronic 
activation to the ester undergoing nucleophilic attack, and transforms an otherwise inter-
molecular ethoxide delivery to the ester carbonyl into an intramolecular one.

 The catalytic efﬁ ciencies of regioisomeric complexes  14 – Ba 2  and  15 – Ba 2  in the basic 
ethanolysis of esters  18 – 21  are compared in Table  8.1  with that of the dinuclear barium 
complex of the closely related ligand  16 , as well as with that of the mononuclear control 
 17 – Ba. 27   Rate measurements refer to conditions where no less than 90% of the ester is 
bound to the catalyst in the productive (Michaelis) complex  II (Scheme  8.4 ), while the 
concentration of the unproductive 2  :  1 complex  III  is negligibly low. The superiority of 
dinuclear catalysts over the mononuclear counterpart demonstrates that the two metal ions 
work in a cooperative fashion, in accordance with the bifunctional catalytic mechanism 
in Scheme  8.4 , but the extent of cooperation is strongly dependent on the catalyst – 
substrate combination. This is not really surprising, as the catalytic mechanism implies 
that the substrate and the catalyst must form a well matched pair in terms of size and 
geometrical features. A convenient comparison of catalytic performances of regioisomeric

 14 – Ba 2 and  15 – Ba 2  complexes, and of the analogous  m - xylylene derivative  16 – Ba 2 is 
carried out in terms of effective molarities ( EM s). 23b   Since the bimetallic catalysts trans-
form an otherwise intermolecular reaction between ester and ethoxide ion into an intramo-
lecular one, the  EM  notion, deﬁ ned by the ratio k intra /k inter (Scheme  8.4 ), strictly applies 
to the catalytic processes at hand. The  EM  provides an absolute measure of the efﬁ ciency 
of the intramolecular catalytic step, that is independent of the intrinsic reactivity of end 
groups. Unlike the catalytic rate enhancement and the advantage of dinuclear over mono-
nuclear catalyst, the  EM  is independent of reactant concentrations, and its numerical value 
is solely determined by the usual choice of molarity as concentration unit. 
 Plots of  EM vs. the carboxylate - carbonyl distances in the ester substrates, taken as a 
gross measure of their size, are shown in Figure  8.1 . It is apparent that the dinuclear cata-
lyst  14 – Ba 2 , in which the azacrown units are linked to vicinal positions of the calix[4]
arene scaffold, is not only far superior to its diagonal regioisomer  15 – Ba 2  in all cases, 
but it is also superior to  16 – Ba 2  in the reactions of esters  18 – 20 . The  EM proﬁ le shows 
that the catalytic efﬁ ciency of  14 – Ba 2  reaches its maximum value in the reaction of ester 
 19 , and drops to a very low value in the reaction of the  ‘ longest ’  ester  21 . This indicates 
that  14 – Ba 2  cannot expand its intermetal distance to ﬁ t the long carboxylate - carbonyl 
distance in  21 . In conclusion, reactivity data obtained for the various catalyst – substrate 
combinations indeed show that a close ﬁ t of ester size to metal - to - metal distance is an 
important prerequisite for catalysis. However, the marked superiority of  14 – Ba 2 over 
 15 – Ba 2  with all of the esters can hardly be ascribed to a more suitable intermetal distance 
in the former. This indicates that in addition to intermetal distance, still poorly understood 
effects may contribute signiﬁ cantly to catalytic efﬁ ciency of dinuclear metal catalysts. 
 8.3.2  Artiﬁ cial Esterases: Zinc(II) Complexes 
 The zinc(II) complex of 2,6 - bis[(dimethylamino)methyl]pyridine (BAMP) is catalytically 
active in the methanolysis of esters at pH 10.4.  28   Rate enhancements (Table  8.2 ) brought 
about by BAMP – Zn 28,29   are much higher for the carboxylate decorated esters  19 – 22 than 
for the parent phenyl acetate  23 , because binding to the metal ion transforms the moder-
ately electron - releasing (rate - retarding) carboxylate into an electron - withdrawing (rate -
 enhancing) one. In the reactions of  23 , moderate differences in rate - enhancements among 
mono - , bi - , and trimetallic complexes indicate that the various metal centres act essen-
tially as independent non - cooperative catalytic units. In marked contrast to the behaviour 
of phenyl acetate  23 , the reactions of the carboxylate - decorated esters are in many cases 
catalyzed by dinuclear complexes  24 – Zn 2  and  25 – Zn 2  much more strongly  –  4 orders of

 Figure 8.2   Bimetallic (left) and trimetallic (right) catalytic mechanism  
magnitude in the most favourable cases  –  than by mononuclear BAMP – Zn. 28,29 This is 
consistent with a bifunctional catalytic mechanism (Figure  8.2 ) in which one of the metal 
ions serves as a docking site for the carboxylate, and the other delivers an activated 
methoxide to the ester function. In the reactions catalyzed by the 1,2 - vicinal complex 
 24 – Zn 2 , the extent of cooperation of the two metal centres is quite high for esters  22 and 
 19 , signiﬁ cantly lower for ester  20  and even lower for ester  21 . Clearly, catalyst  24 – Zn 2 
experiences an increasing difﬁ culty to ﬁ t the altered substrate in the transition state when 
the ester size exceeds that of  19 . A similar trend of reactivity is seen in the reactions 
carried out in the presence of the less effective catalyst  25 – Zn 2 . In this case, however, 
there is no sign of cooperation between metal centres in the reactions of  20 and  21 . 
 The marked superiority of the 1,2 - vicinal complex  24 – Zn 2  over its distal regioisomer 
 25 – Zn 2  closely parallels that observed in the basic ethanolysis catalyzed by dinuclear 
complexes  14 – Ba 2  and  15 – Ba 2  (Table  8.1 ). The results obtained in the basic methanolysis 
of esters catalyzed by the zinc(II) complexes of calix[4]arenes  28 – 31  decorated with 
1,5,9 - triazacyclododecane ([12]aneN 3 ) ligands fully conﬁ rm the superiority of 1,2 - 
vicinal bimetallic catalysts over their distal regioisomers.  30   Thus, the order of catalytic 
efﬁ ciency 1,2 - vicinal  >>  1,3 - distal appears to be a substrate - independent feature of upper 
rim calix[4]arene - based bimetallic catalysts for the cleavage of carboxylate - functional-
ized esters, which is unaffected by the nature of the metal ion and of the corresponding 
ligating unit. 
 Kinetic data obtained in the reactions catalyzed by the BAMP ligated zinc complexes 
permit reliable estimates of the  k intra  and  k inter  quantities needed for the calculation of  EM s.

 EM  data are plotted in Figure  8.3  together with available data related to the basic 
ethanolysis catalyzed by dinuclear complexes  14 – Ba 2  and  15 – Ba 2 . The superiority of both 
 14 – Ba 2  and  15 – Ba 2  to the structurally related  24 – Zn 2  and  25 – Zn 2  indicates a lower adapt-
ability of the zinc(II) complexes to the altered substrates in the transition state, which is 
believed to arise from more stringent requirements of the coordinative interactions of a 
 d - block metal ion compared with an  s - block metal ion.

 The highest catalytic activity in the methanolysis of esters  18 – 22  is exhibited in most

complex, with the third metal ion acting as a spectator. In  26 – Zn 3  and  31 – Zn 3  there are

 distal bimetallic complexes is very low, the activity of trimetallic complexes may be 
thought as the sum of contributions arising from two 1,2 - vicinal bimetallic arrangements. 
The statistical advantage of  26 – Zn 3 ( 31 – Zn 3 ) over  24 – Zn 2 ( 29 – Zn 2 ) is 2 under subsaturat-
ing conditions, but reduces to 4/3 under saturating conditions.  30 Thus, the statistical 
advantage of a trimetallic complex over its 1,2 - vicinal bimetallic analogue should lie 
somewhere between 2 and 1.3, most likely closer to the lower limit because either set of 
catalytic experiments was carried out under conditions not far from saturation. The ﬁ nding 
that  26 – Zn 3  is about four times as effective as  24 – Zn 2  in the cleavage of  19 (Table  8.2 ) 
provides a strong indication of the cooperation of three metal ions in the catalytic mecha-
nism. Efﬁ cient cooperation of three metal ions (Zn, Cu) in the cleavage of phosphodiesters 
was reported in a number of studies  25,31   but, to the best of our knowledge, trimetallic 
catalysis in ester cleavage is unprecedented. 
 The proposed mechanism depicted in Figure  8.2  emphasizes the three different func-
tions performed by the metal ions: ( i ) substrate recognition through binding to carboxy-
late, ( ii ) Lewis - acid activation of the ester carbonyl, and ( iii ) nucleophile delivery. We 
further note that  k obs ( 26 – Zn 3 )/ k obs ( 24 – Zn 2 )   =   2.4 in the cleavage of  20  (Table 2), and that 
 k obs ( 31 – Zn 3 )/ k obs ( 29 – Zn 2 )   =   2.4 also in the cleavage of  22 . 30   It appears therefore that there 
are small, but higher than statistical advantages of trinuclear over 1,2 - vicinal dinuclear 
catalysts, which might be taken as an indication of a modest contribution from the third 
metal ion. 
 8.3.4  Artiﬁ cial Nucleases: Zinc(II) Complexes 
 Efﬁ cient catalysis of HPNP transesteriﬁ cation (Equation  8.10 ) arising from synergic 
action of the two metal centres was reported in previous studies  25   for the dinuclear zinc(II) 
complex of BAMP functionalized calix[4]arene  25 . In marked contrast to what observed 
on the catalytic cleavage of esters (Table  8.2 ), the 1,2 - vicinal complex  24 – Zn 2 was 
subsequently found  28   to be signiﬁ cantly less effective than its 1,3 - distal regioisomer 
 25 – Zn 2 .
 
 
 
 (8.10) 
 A major limitation of the BAMP functionalized catalysts is the limited solubility in 
water, that requires the use of an organic cosolvent. Another limitation is the afﬁ nity of 
BAMP for zinc(II), that is large enough for catalytic studies run at millimolar catalyst 
concentrations in 50% aqueous CH 3 CN at pH 7.0 ( K  ≈  1  ×  10 5  M  − 1 ), but drops to 
1  ×  10 3  M  − 1  in water at pH 7.0. In the aim at developing metal catalysts which are soluble 
enough in water to avoid the use of organic cosolvents, the [12]aneN 3 ligating unit seemed 
appropriate, because its high afﬁ nity for zinc(II) in water (Log  K  =  8.4 at 25  ° C) ensures 
extensive binding of the metal ion to the ligand even at submillimolar concentrations. 32 
Unfortunately, the zinc(II) complexes of ligands  28 – 31  were not soluble enough in water 
for catalytic studies. Furthermore, catalytic studies carried out in 50% aqueous CH 3 CN 
(Table  8.3 ) revealed a disappointing lack of synergism between metal ions, which is at 
variance with the results obtained with the corresponding BAMP complexes.  25,28 The 
moral of this story is that even promising arrangements of catalytically effective ligated

metal ions on a molecular platform by no means guarantee effective cooperation between 
catalytic units. 
 8.3.5  Artiﬁ cial Nucleases: Copper(II) Complexes 
 The afﬁ nity of [12]aneN 3  for copper(II) in water (Log  K  =  12.6 at 25  ° C) is still higher 
than that of zinc(II) and the copper(II) complexes of ligands  28 – 31  are soluble enough 
in water for kinetic experiments, the highest solubility being experienced by  31 – Cu 3 . 
Although mononuclear copper(II) complexes are an order of magnitude less effective than 
the corresponding zinc(II) complexes in the cleavage of HPNP (Table 3), cooperation

between metal centres is signiﬁ cant in the 1,2 - vicinal dinuclear complex  29 – Cu 2 . 32 In 
contrast, the catalytic efﬁ ciency of  30 – Cu 2 is about twice as great as that of  27 – Cu, 
showing that there is no rate acceleration per metal centre. It also appears that the trime-
tallic complex  31 – Cu 3 behaves as a 1,2 - vicinal dinuclear catalyst, whose efﬁ ciency is 
somewhat lowered by the third metal centre. The close adherence to the Michaelis –
 Menten equation (Figure  8.4 ) indicates the intermediacy of a reversibly formed, moder-
ately stable HPNP - catalyst complex ( K  =  1/ K M  =  500  M  − 1 ). A likely mode of binding of 
HPNP to the catalyst involves interaction of the phosphate moiety to the copper(II) ions 
in the 1,2 - vicinal position (Figure  8.5 ), in what amounts to double Lewis - acid activation, 
with the putative involvement of the metal hydroxide as a general base.

 It is well known that species that cleave effectively  p - nitrophenyl phosphates are not 
necessarily good catalysts for the cleavage of unactivated phosphate esters. It was there-
fore quite gratifying to ﬁ nd that  31 – Cu 3 cleaves with high efﬁ ciency eight diribonucle-
oside monophosphates (Equation  8.11 ) out of nine in the tested lot (Table  8.4 ).  32 Catalytic 
rate accelerations are in the order of 10 4  - fold in most cases, to be compared with the 10 3 -
 fold rate accelerations in the cleavage of HPNP (Table  8.3 ). The rate enhancement rises 
to 10 5  - fold in the cleavage of UpU and this was suggested to be caused by the additional 
binding site arising from the copper - assisted deprotonation of the uracyl moiety at the 
5 ′ - hydroxyl terminus. 
 
 
 
 (8.11) 
 The inertness of CpA in the presence of  31 – Cu 3  (Table  8.4 ) is not due to the inherently 
low reactivity of the substrate, nor to its insensitivity to copper(II) catalysis, as shown by 
the ﬁ nding that CpA is cleaved by [12]aneN 3 – Cu and  30 – Cu 2  about 3 times more rapidly 
than UpU.  32   Furthermore, the efﬁ ciency of  31 – Cu 3  in the cleavage of UpU is similar to

that of  29 – Cu 2 , and this reinforces the view that  31 – Cu 3  uses only two vicinal metal 
centres in the catalysis, with the third metal ion acting as a more or less innocent spectator. 
 The phosphodiesterase activity of the copper(II) complexes was further explored in the 
cleavage of oligomeric ribonucleotides.  33   The kinetics was investigated using gel electro-
phoresis to separate and analyze reactant and products having a radioactive phosphate 
label in the 5 ′  - terminal position (Equation  8.12 ). Rate constants for the cleavage of all of 
the scissile bonds of oligoribonucleotides  32 – 37 , obtained either from time - course kinet-
ics (e.g. Figure  8.6 ) or from initial rates, are listed in Table  8.5 , where the fatness of the 
arrows pointing to the scissile bonds gives a rough indication of the relative reactivity. 
There is an undeniable tendency for the catalytic efﬁ ciency to increase with the number 
of metal units, revealing variable extents of cooperation between metal centres of trime-
tallic and bimetallic complexes. In a number of cases the 1,2 - vicinal complex  29 – Cu 2 is 
superior to its distal regioisomer  30 – Cu 2 , in line with what observed in the reactions of 
HPNP and UpU, but in other cases the reverse holds. A similar, not clearly deﬁ ned situ-
ation, holds for the relative efﬁ ciency of trinuclear  vs.  dinuclear complexes, because the 
observed reactivity order strongly depends on oligoribonucleotide identity. In any event, 
whenever the trinuclear complex is the best cleaving agent in the lot, the advantage due 
to the third metal ion hardly exceeds a factor of 2, which indicates that a compelling 
evidence of the operation of trimetallic catalysis is lacking. It is worth noting that the rate 
enhancement of  ca. 5  ×  10 5  - fold relative to background in the cleavage of CpA bound in 
 35  by  31 – Cu 3  is one of the highest values recorded for a synthetic metallonuclease in the 
cleavage of ribonucleotide dimers or higher oligomers.  25,34

 In marked contrast to the UpU and UpG selectivity observed in the reaction of oligori-
bonucleoside monophosphates (Table  8.4 ), a remarkable selectivity in the cleavage of the 
CpA bond of oligoribonucleotides  32  and  35  is observed for all metal complexes (Table 
 8.5 ). This is fully conﬁ rmed by the behaviour of heptadecamer  38 , in which all CpA 
bonds are cleaved by  29 – Cu 2  (Table  8.6 ), whereas other bonds do not undergo appreciable 
scission. A closely similar behaviour was experienced in the presence of  30 – Cu 2 . CpA

bonds labelled as   α ,   β  and   γ  are cleaved much more rapidly than bonds labelled as   δ and 
 ε , which suggests that far away CpA bonds are cleaved more slowly than bonds closer 
to the 5 ′ - terminal position. This view is corroborated by the reactivity ratios of 27  :  10  :  1 
calculated from the data in Table  8.5 for the  31 – Cu 3  catalyzed cleavage of the CpA bond 
in  35 ,  32  and  36 , respectively. A mechanism consistent with the above ﬁ ndings is depicted 
in Figure  8.7 . The primary binding interaction between catalyst and substrate involves 
one of the metal centres and the  32 P - radiolabelled 5 ′  - terminal phosphate dianion. One of 
the possible productive complexes ( II ) is depicted as a dinuclear metallomacrocycle 
arising from intramolecular binding of one of the singly charged phosphates to the 
other metal centre. The fact that  K II  is expected to decrease on increasing the ring size is 
well in keeping with the ﬁ nding that scissile bonds close to the 5 ′ - terminus are cleaved 
more easily. 
 8.4  Concluding Remarks 
 In this chapter we have shown that calixarenes have undergone a limited, but highly 
signiﬁ cant amount of research on their ability to include into their cavities reactant guests 
or part - structures of reactants, thereby exerting a strong reactivity control of hosted 
species in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions.

Reactivity Control by Calixarenes 
223
 The versatility of calixarenes as platforms on which to build mono -  and multitopic 
ligands has been known for long. In the second part of the chapter we have focussed on 
the dynamic preorganization of the calix[4]arene platform, that induces high levels of 
cooperation between two and, possibly, three ligated metal ions in the cleavage of car-
boxylate esters and phosphodiesters, including RNA oligonucleotides. 
 It is felt that calixarenes have not exhausted their potential yet, and that future research 
in the area of reactivity control and catalysis by calixarenes looks promising of exciting 
new results.

Reactions Inside Carcerands

 9.1  Introduction 
 Molecular container molecules are spherical, hollow hosts with inner cavities that are 
large enough to accommodate one or more guest molecules.  1   They were developed by 
Donald J. Cram in the mid 1980s and have been used extensively as molecular reaction 
ﬂ ask in order to study the effect of the conﬁ nement on reactions involving the encapsu-
lated guest. 2 
 In 1985, Cram and co - workers synthesized carcerand  1  by multiply linking cavitand  2 
and  3 (Figure  9.1 ). 3   The name carcerand is derived from the Latin word  carcer , which 
means  ‘ prison ’ . During the shell - closure,  1  trapped almost every component present in 
the reaction ﬂ ask. In carcerands, the incarcerated guest cannot leave the container even 
at high temperature. Complexes with permanently imprisoned guests are termed carce-
plexes. In contrast, hemicarcerands form stable hemicarceplexes at ambient temperature, 
but incarcerate and release guests at elevated temperature, whereby the guest passes 
through one of the size - restricted equatorial openings in the host shell (Figure  9.2 ). 
 Hemicarceplexes are stabilized by intrinsic and constrictive binding energy.  4 The latter, 
a physical barrier, is the activation free energy required for a guest to enter the inner 
cavity and typically amounts to 25 – 30  kcal  mol  − 1 . 4b   In carceplexes, this barrier is so high 
that guest escape is impossible without host destruction. Isolated from the bulk phase, the

guest can freely rotate inside its molecular prison. Cram coined the name  ‘ inner phase ’ 
for the interior of a container compound since the properties of an incarcerated guest 
molecule are different from those in the bulk phase.   
 A large variety of hemicarcerands have been synthesized by connecting two cavitands 
with four appropriate linkers (Figure  9.3 ).  4b,5 Among those, perhaps, the most versatile 
container molecule with respect to binding properties is hemicarcerand  4 , which forms 
stable hemicarceplexes with guests ranging in size from benzene to naphthalene. Owing 
to its excellent binding properties and the ease of preparing hemicarceplexes,  4  has been 
the host of choice for applications as molecular reaction ﬂ ask to study reactions of encap-
sulated guests.  
 The synthesis of hemicarcerands and carceplexes is a templated reaction and the proper 
choice of template molecule, which complements the shape and size of the inner cavity

Molecular Encapsulation
of the desired hemicarcerand, is vitally important. 6 – 7   For carceplex  5  Guest, yields 
ranged from zero to 89% and template efﬁ ciency correlates nicely with the size and 
shape complementarity of inner cavity and guest.  8   Yields are highest, when the cavitands 
and template can be preassembled in a trimeric hydrogen - bonded complex  6 . 8b – c,9 The 
H - bonding complex  6  is unimportant for the formation of hemicarceplexes  4  Guest 
and of other larger hemicarceplexes.  10   For the larger host  4 , linking the two cavitands 
with the ﬁ rst bridge disrupts the H - bonds of  6  allowing for subsequent intermolecular 
and intramolecular reactions. The template does not affect the course of the reaction 
until after the second linker is introduced and has determined the fate of the product. 
In  N  - methylpyrrolidinone as solvent, closing the host shell with the fourth bridge is 
rate determining and requires heating.  5e,f   At room temperature, diol  7  accumulates and 
becomes available. Diol  7  provides an easy entry to unsymmetrical hemicarcerands with 
three unique and one different linker (e.g.  8 – 13 in Figure  9.3 ). 5e.f,11 Furthermore, using 
the so - called  ‘ seal - in ’  procedure, hemicarceplexes  4  Guest or  8 – 13  Guest can be syn-
thesized by reacting  7  with a linker unit in the presence of the guest in the solvent 
hexamethylphosphoramide, which is too large to serve as template.  5e,f The seal - in pro-
cedure allows synthesis of hemicarceplexes with guests that are thermally too unstable 
to be  ‘ heated ’ into empty  4 or  8 – 13 . 12 
 The novelty of hemicarcerand structures has lured molecular container chemists to 
study properties and reactivity of incarcerated guests. Interesting questions that seek 
answers are: Could one conduct reactions inside hemicarcerands and how would they 
differ from their bulk phase counterparts? How do small reactants such as protons, elec-
trons or photons pass through the host skeleton in order to reach the incarcerated guest? 
Can we even generate and protect highly reactive molecules inside the inner phase and 
prevent their self - destruction via dimerization or the reaction with bulk phase reactants 
that are too large to pass through the protective host skin? Is catalysis possible in such 
novel reaction chambers? In the following, I will summarize recent efforts in exploring 
inner phase chemistry and in stabilizing reactive intermediates by incarceration. 
 9.2  Types of Inner Phase Reactions 
 Conceptually, one can divide inner phase reactions into four groups (Figure  9.5 ): 
 (1)  Intermolecular inner phase reactions 
 (2)  Intramolecular inner phase reactions 
 (3)  Mother molecule – daughter molecule reactions 
 (4)  Innermolecular inner phase reactions. 
 In intermolecular inner phase reactions, the incarcerated guest reacts with a bulk phase 
reactant. This may require full or partial passage of the bulk phase reactant through one 
of the openings in the host shell. In most cases, it is difﬁ cult to discriminate between both 
models. Many different intermolecular inner phase reactions have been carried out with 
sometimes very surprising outcomes and are summarized in section  9.4 . 
 Light or heat triggers intramolecular inner phase reactions and causes rearrangement 
of the incarcerated guest or fragmentation. Such reactions have lead to the generation of 
incarcerated reactive intermediates and are discussed in sections  9.5  – 6 .

Reactions Inside Carcerands 
231
 Two further new inner phase reaction types have been introduced recently. In Okazaki ’ s 
mother molecule – daughter molecule - reactions, an external stimulus leads to the release 
of a guest (daughter), which was covalently linked to the inner surface of the surrounding 
container (mother) to form a new mother molecule – daughter molecule complex. 13 The 
opposite are innermolecular reactions.  14   The incarcerated guest reacts with the inner 
surface of the surrounding molecular container leading to a covalent adduct. The latter 
two reaction types are particularly interesting. The mother molecule – daughter molecule 
complex formation allows the generation of an encapsulated reactive intermediate or of 
an endohedral - ﬁ xed reactive functionality, which both are protected by the surrounding 
capsule shell. Innermolecular reactions are interesting since these reactions take part at 
the concave inner surface of one reactant (the host), which is rather uncommon.  
 9.3  Probing the Properties of the Inner Phase 
 9.3.1  Amide C − N Bond Rotation and Ring - Flip of Cyclohexanes 
 The precise mix of free and occupied space inside the reactant ﬁ lled container, 15 the shape 
of the inner phase, the rigidity of the container and the electronic nature of its inner surface 
may all or in part contribute to the reaction dynamics and selectivity of an inner phase 
reaction. Reversible conformational changes of guest molecules are easily tractable spec-
troscopically and ideal to study the effect of conﬁ nement on transition states. Cram and 
co - workers studied the  cis - trans isomerization of (CH 3 ) 2 NCHO and (CH 3 ) 2 NCOCH 3 
inside  5 . 5a For (CH 3 ) 2 NCHO, the C − N rotational barrier decreased in the order liquid 
phase  >  inner phase  >    vacuum and was  ∼ 1  kcal  mol  − 1  lower inside  5  than in nitrobenzene. 
For (CH 3 ) 2 NCOCH 3 , the order was inner phase    >  liquid phase  >    vacuum and the barrier

 ∼ 2  kcal  mol  − 1  higher inside  5  than in solution. Cram explained these trends with the dif-
ferent ratio of free and occupied space in the inner phase. In CPK models, (CH 3 ) 2 NCHO 
is loosely held inside the container, whereas (CH 3 ) 2 NCOCH 3 is strongly compressed 
against the host walls in the ground state and even more so in the transition state for bond 
rotation. Thus, the rigid container resists being deformed more than the solvent cage 
resists being moved to accommodate the transition state. Depending on the mix of free 
and occupied space, the inner phase may be more like vacuum, liquid or even solid. 
Likewise ring inversion of 1,4 - thioxane and 1,4 - dioxane has a 1.8  kcal  mol  − 1 and 
1.6  kcal  mol  − 1  higher barrier inside  5  than in the liquid phase (Figure  9.6 ).  16 The origin 
for the increased barriers is not fully clear and may result from ground state effects, such 
as stabilizing host - guest contacts that are lost in the transition state, or steric constraints 
in the transition state. Nevertheless, one can conclude that host rigidity translates into 
high sensitivity towards small structural perturbations of the guest. 
 9.3.2  Spectroscopic Probes 
 Molecules that change their photophysical characteristics in response to changes in the 
environment are well suited to probe the electronic and spatial properties of conﬁ ned 
spaces. 17 Pina  et al . measured large bathochromic shifts for absorption, ﬂ uorescence and 
phosphorescence maxima upon incarcerating biacetyl inside  14 (Figures  9.3 and  9.7 ). 18 
These shifts are far outside the range of values of free biacetyl in any solvent. Nau 
interpreted these red - shifts with an unusually high polarizability inside  14 . 19 Absorption 
maxima and inverse oscillator strength correlated linearly with solvent polarizability. 
From these solvatochromic shifts, Nau estimated the polarizability of the inner phase, 
which is substantially higher than that of the highly polarizable diodomethane. Compared 
to the cavity of cyclodextrins or cucurbit[7]urils, which have polarizabilities that are 
closer to the other extreme,  19   the inner phase constitutes an environment of unusually high 
polarizability, which has consequences for the dynamics of inner phase reactions as will

the order  4  <  14  <  15 . However, the singlet - triplet excited state energy gap   ∆ S 1 – T 1 
remained nearly constant for all three hemicarceplexes. Since the S 1  →  S 0 transition 
moment is orders of magnitude larger than that of the forbidden T 1  →  S 0  transition, a 
coupling between the transition dipole and polarizability dipole cannot be the origin for 
the emission shifts. Romanova  et al . explained these shifts with smaller amounts of free 
space inside the inner cavity as compared to liquids and postulated a higher  ‘ effective 
local pressure ’  inside hemicarcerands. With decreasing cavity size biacetyl may twist out 
of planarity, which would explain the observed trend.

 9.4.1  Proton Transfer Reactions 
 The investigation of proton transfer between incarcerated bases and bulk phase acids 
provides insight into the effect of incarceration on the guest ’ s acidity or basicity. It is 
expected that the hydrophobicity of the inner phase will alter the p K a  of the incarcerated 
guest, which is reminiscent to many enzyme - catalyzed reactions.  21 Cram and co - workers 
studied proton transfers between a strong bulk phase acid and incarcerated amines 
 15  pyridine,  15  (CH 3 CH 2 ) 2 NH and  15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 NH 2 . 4a   Despite a large enough 
opening in the shell of  15 , attempts to protonate incarcerated pyridine with CF 3 COOD in 
CDCl 3  failed. Cram suggested that the reduced basicity is a result of ineffective solvation 
of the pyridinium ion by the rigid host, the inability to form a contact ion pair in the inner 
phase and the larger size of the pyridinium ion compared to pyridine. Inaccessibility of 
the unshared electron pair of incarcerated pyridine would also be an explanation, but 
seems very unlikely (Figure  9.8 A). 
 For  15  (CH 3 CH 2 ) 2 NH, instantaneous decomplexation of  15  (CH 3 CH 2 ) 2 ND 2 + accom-
panied through - shell proton transfer. The ability to protonate  15  (CH 3 CH 2 ) 2 NH with 
CF 3 COOD in CDCl 3  results from the location of the nitrogen of (CH 3 CH 2 ) 2 NH in the 
equatorial region close to the portals (Figure  9.8 B). After protonation, the counter ion

pulled the guest out of the inner phase. Addition of excess CF 3 COOD to  15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 NH 2 
lead to a 2  :  1 mixture of  15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 ND 3 + and  15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 ND 2 , which remained 
constant over time although slow decomplexation took place. Complete protonation of 
 15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 NH 2  required 100 eq. of CF 3 COOD. Excess CD 3 COOD only H/D 
exchanged the amine protons. These results show that the acidity of incarcerated 
CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 NH 2  is comparable to that of CF 3 COOH in CDCl 3 . Furthermore, the strong 
upﬁ eld - shifted amine protons of  15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 NH 2  imply guest alignment along the 
polar axis of  15 . In this orientation, through - shell protonation most likely occurs through 
the holes in the polar caps of  15 (Figure  9.8 C). 
 9.4.2  Electron Transfer Reactions 
 Electron transfer (ET) plays an important role in many organic reactions.  22 Although ET 
processes are most efﬁ cient in contact donor acceptor complexes, electron tunneling over 
long distance is possible.  23   Thus, ET reactions are well suited to be studied between an 
incarcerated guest and a bulk phase reducing or oxidizing agent. An oxidation - reduction 
cycle for hydroquinones  16 – 19  could be carried out in the interior of  4 (Figure  9.9 ). 24 
Oxidation with Ce(NH 4 ) 2 (NO 2 ) 6 – silica gel − CDCl 3 or Tl(O 2 CCF 3 ) 3 − CCl 4  led to the parent 
incarcerated quinones  20 – 23 in essentially quantitative yields. 
 In the absence of light, the incarcerated quinones were stable below 100    ° C, despite 
their usual instability in solution. Reduction back to the hydroquinones was possible 
with SmI 2 /MeOH. The same reagent reduced nitrobenzene  24  to  N - hydroxyl - aniline 
 25 . Surprisingly, aniline, which is the product in the liquid phase, is not formed. The latter 
result, the high yields, and the instability of free  o  - quinones, suggests that all reduction/
oxidation took place inside  4 , rather than by a dissociation  –  bulk phase reaction  – 
association mechanism. It also demonstrates that electrons are transferred readily through 
the host shell in and out of the inner phase. The exact mechanism of the ET and the role of 
the intervening medium (the host) are not clear yet. To get more insight, Kaifer compared 
the electrochemical behavior of free and incarcerated ferrocene inside  26 (Figures  9.3 and 
 9.9 ). 25   In the inner phase, ET was strongly hindered kinetically and thermodynamically. 
A more positive half - way potential for the oxidation, due to the hydrophobicity of the 
inner phase, as well as 10 - fold rate retardation was measured. To support the observation

of an inner phase oxidation/reduction cycle, Kaifer isolated oxidized ferrocene hemicarce-
plex  26  ferrocene + . The NMR spectrum showed large spectral shifts and line - broadening 
compared to that of  26  ferrocene, which is consistent with the formation of paramagnetic 
ferrocene + . The blue color of ferrocene +  and its NMR spectrum persisted at room tempera-
ture for days until  26  ferrocene +  slowly reverted back to  26  ferrocene, revealing that 
guest dissociation/association can be excluded within the time frame of the electrochemi-
cal experiments. Kaifer suggested that the slower ET between the incarcerated ferrocene 
and the electrode surface could result partially from the higher mass of  26  ferrocene 
compared to ferrocene and also from a reduction of the electronic coupling between the 
ferrocene center and the electrode which is affected by the increase in distance from 3.5  Å 
to about 9  Å . Whether the hemicarcerand ’ s aromatic structure mediates the electron 
coupling is not clear. 
 9.4.3  Nucleophilic Substitutions and Isotopic Exchanges 
 The alkylation studies of Kurdistani  et al . provide much insight into the relationship 
between reactivity and guest orientation and bulk phase reagent size.  5e Different phenols 
were alkylated in the inner phase of  4 . Two factors determined the observed reactivity: 
(a) portal size and (b) preferred guest orientation relative to the equatorial - located portals. 
Alkylation with NaH/MeI in THF of 4 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 ( p - cresol) or 4 - HOC 6 H 4 OH ( p -
 hydroquinone) was impossible. Under the same conditions, 2 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 ( o - cresol), 
3 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 ( m - cresol), and 3 - HOC 6 H 4 OH (resorcinol) were quantitatively methylated. 
2 - HOC 6 H 4 OH (catechol) gave a mixture of mono -  and dimethylated carceplexes. An 
examination of typical crystal structures of hemicarceplexes with 1,4 - disubstituted 
benzene guest suggests that the OH - group of 4 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3  is located in a protected polar 
cap of the host.  5b In  ortho - or  meta  - disubstituted benzenes, one substituent resides inside 
a shielded polar cap, whereas the second substituent is located near a portal. This suggests 
that these reactions must occur in the entryways through a linear transition state, which 
is partially  ‘ solvated ’  by the alkoxy - units that align the host ’ s portals (Figure  9.10 ). Since 
this  ‘ pseudo solvent cage ’  has limited ﬂ exibility, alkylation with larger alkylating agents 
failed. 
 Likewise in D 2 O - saturated CDCl 3 , no D - for - H exchange of OH groups was possible 
when guests were 4 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 , 2 - HOC 6 H 4 OH or 4 - HOC 6 H 4 OH. 5e   In the presence of 
diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec - 7 - ene, 4 - HOC 6 H 4 OH exchanged its hydroxyl - protons, but not

the conformationally more ﬁ xed 4 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 . In THF - NaH at 25  ° C followed by D 2 O -
 quench, the hydroxyl - protons of 2 - HOC 6 H 4 OH, which are more exposed to the equatorial -
 located portals, exchange, but not the protected hydroxyl - protons of 4 - HOC 6 H 4 OH and 
4 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 . 
 Such steric interactions in the transition state, that serve as selectivity criteria in these 
inner phase reactions, also contribute to the highly structural recognition in enzyme -
 catalyzed reactions. The understanding of these interactions provides valuable guidelines 
for the rational design of novel highly selective catalysts in the future.  
 9.4.4  Nucleophilic Additions 
 Inner phase guest orientation and mobility also control reactivity in through - shell borane 
and methyllithium additions to benzaldehyde  27 , benzocyclobutenone  28  and benzocy-
clobutadione  29  inside hemicarcerand  4 . 26 BH 3  - THF reduced all three incarcerated guests 
to the corresponding alcohols  30 – 32 (Figure  9.11 A – C). Guest reactivity differed from 
that in the liquid phase and increased in the order  29  ≈  28  >  27 . Furthermore, incarcerated 
 29  added only one equivalent of BH 3 - THF. Reduction of the second carbonyl group 
required aqueous work - up followed by addition of BH 3 - THF to  4  33 . Hydrolysis of 
 4  33 gave incarcerated  cis - benzocyclobutenediol  34 . X - ray structures helped to rational-
ize these observations (Figure  9.11 D – E). 
 In  4  27  and  4  28 , the guest ’ s carbonyl groups are located inside a host ’ s cavitand 
and reduction requires reorientation of the guest. The additional conformational energy 
adds to the activation energy and is higher for  27  as compared to  28 . In  4  29 , one carbo-
nyl is shielded. The other is perfectly positioned for through - shell reaction inside an 
entryway. After addition to the exposed C = O, coordination of the boron of  35  to a host ’ s 
ether oxygen hinders guest rotation and prevents exposure of the second C = O until  35 is 
hydrolyzed. 
 Guest orientations also explain outcomes of CH 3 Li additions to incarcerated  27 – 29 
(Figure  9.12 ). Again, guest reactivity decreased in the order  29  >>  28  >  27 .  29 added 
one equivalent of CH 3 Li already at  − 78  ° C to yield  36  and Moore rearrangement product 
 37 . 27   No double - addition took place. Hemicarceplex  4  28  required room temperature 
for a complete reaction. Under the same conditions,  4  27  reacted sluggishly and 
incompletely. 
 Very interesting are the formation of host cleavage products  39  and  7  in these reactions, 
which resulted from innermolecular reactions of the incarcerated lithium alcoholates. In 
the CH 3 Li addition to  4  28 , lithium alcoholate  40  partially underwent an innermolecular 
nucleophilic displacement at one of the host ’ s acetals yielding hemicarcerand  39 and 
 39  41 (Figures  9.12 – 9.13 ). On the other hand, at 0  ° C incarcerated lithium alcoholates 
 43  and/or  44  cleaved one of the O − (CH 2 ) 4 − O linker of  4  via   β - elimination (Figure  9.13 B). 
Bulk phase lithium alcoholates are not basic enough to induce this reaction. The incarcer-
ated counterparts must be several orders of magnitude more reactive. Three factors con-
tribute to this rate - acceleration. (1) The absence of aggregation of R ′ OLi in the inner 
phase. 28   (2) The poor ability of  4  to  ‘ solvate ’ R ′ OLi, which increases its basicity.  4a (3) 
Lithium coordination to an oxygen lone pair of the cleaved C − O bond positions the 
alkoxide O in close proximity to the   β  - H of the bridge and provides charge compensation 
during the concerted  syn - elimination (Figure  9.13 B). 29   These examples and those dis-
cussed in the previous section show that through - shell and inner phase chemistry clearly

differs from  ‘ conventional ’  chemistry in the bulk phase with respect to reactivity and 
selectivity. Inner phase and through - shell reactions show the following characteristic 
features: 
  (1)     Guest functional groups that reside inside a host ’ s polar cap are less reactive than 
those exposed to an equatorial portal, which have the potential for high through - shell 
reactivity. 
 (2)  The reactivity of bulk phase reactants is largely inﬂ uenced by their size and shape 
relative to that of the host ’ s equatorial portals.

  (3)     If functional groups are protected in the guest ’ s most favorable orientation, reactivity 
depends on the inner phase rotational mobility of the guest. 
  (4)     The basicity and nucleophilicity of incarcerated lithium alcoholates exceeds those of 
bulk phase alcoholates by several orders of magnitude resulting in efﬁ cient inner -
 molecular elimination or nucleophilic transacetalisation and formation of hemi-
carcerands with one extended portal. In these innermolecular reactions, small structural 
changes of the guest have a sound effect on the reaction mode.        
 9.5  Intramolecular Thermal Reactions 
 In the previous section we have seen that the nucleophilicity and basicity of incarcerated 
lithium alcoholates strongly exceeds those of bulk phase alcoholates mainly as a result 
of the lack of aggregation and poor solvation by the host.  26   As a consequence, innermo-
lecular reaction involving lithium alcoholates are strongly accelerated. Several extrusion 
reactions have been studied inside container molecules and have highlighted additional 
ways how encapsulation inside a hemicarcerand may accelerate or decelerate inner phase 
reactions.

and/formation takes place in close proximity of the host ’ s aryl units. 30,31 The thermo-
lysis of diazirines is a common method to produce carbenes and its mechanism has 
been studied in detail (Figure  9.14 A).  32   Compared to the bulk phase, inner phase 
fragmentation of  48  is 15 - fold accelerated, that of  49  slightly faster (1.2 fold) and 
that of  50 2.4 - fold slower. 30   Furthermore, all inner phase transition states are stabilized 
enthalpically by 2 – 3  kcal  mol  − 1 , which, in the case of  49  and  50 , is partially or fully 
compensated by unfavorable entropic contributions to   ∆ G ‡ . The unfavorable   ∆ T ∆ S ‡ 
term likely results from loss of vibrational degrees of freedom as the guest expands 
upon reaching the transition state leading to a tighter hemicarceplex. The favorable 
enthalpic stabilization is interesting and was explained with the high polarizability of 
the inner phase.  19,31 The stretched C − N bonds of the transition state are more polariz-
able than those of the ground state. Thus, the transition state will be stronger stabilized

through dispersion interactions,  33   especially since bond breaking takes place in close 
proximity of the highly polarizable aryl units of a cavitand (Figure  9.14 B – C). 
 In an extended study, Sanchez Carrera  et al . explored the inﬂ uence of hemicarcerand 
shape on the thermolysis of phenyldiazirines.  31   All inner phase transition states were 
slightly accelerated. Rate constants increase in the order:  9  49  >  12  49  >  10  49  >  
 4  49  >  13  49  and vary overall by a factor of 3.2. Again, inner phase transition states 
where stabilized enthalpically by about 2  kcal  mol  − 1  and moderately destabilized entropi-
cally. Furthermore, faster rates were observed for hemicarceplexes whose fourth shorter 
bridge induces a slight kink in the host structure. This was interpreted with an induced 
ﬁ t model and a better ability of the latter hemicarcerands to accommodate the slightly 
bend transition state.  
 9.5.2  Fragmentation of 3 - Sulfolene 
 A very interesting thermal pericyclic reaction inside the asymmetric carcerand  51 was 
recently reported by Reinhoudt and co - workers. 34 They studied the extrusion of SO 2 and 
butadiene from incarcerated 3 - sulfolene by mass spectrometry (Figure  9.15 ).  34b 
 The extrusion of SO 2  and butadiene from free 3 - sulfolene readily takes place at 100 –
 130  ° C. Substantially higher temperatures were required for carceplex  51  3 - sulfolene. 
SO 2  was only detected above 170 – 180  ° C, and butadiene at 215    ° C. Up to 180    ° C only 
the intact carceplex was observed. Above 180    ° C, also empty  51  but neither a SO 2 car-
ceplex, nor a butadiene carceplex was detected. Since this host is stable at such high 
temperatures, guest escape due to the thermal destruction of  51  can be excluded. Hence, 
the detected SO 2  and butadiene must result from  51  3 - sulfolene and must escape the

inner phase through one of the larger side portals. Reinhoudt explained the unusually 
high thermal stability of incarcerated 3 - sulfolene with a fast recombination in the inner 
phase (Figure  9.15 ). Below 180  ° C, a thermal equilibrium between 3 - sulfolene, SO 2 and 
butadiene is established, which is pulled towards the extrusion products via their escape 
from the inner phase above 180    ° C. This shows impressively how the conﬁ nement 
changes the rates of bimolecular reactions by providing a very high local concentration 
of both reactants. 35 
 9.6  Inner Phase Photochemistry 
 9.6.1  Inner Phase Stabilization of Reactive Intermediates: Concept 
 The possibility to photolyze incarcerated guest molecules opens up the opportunity to 
generate and protect highly strained and reactive molecules inside carcerands.  2 This 
allows NMR spectroscopic characterization of otherwise ﬂ eeting species, which comple-
ments matrix isolation spectroscopy, ultra - fast spectroscopy or ﬂ ow techniques. The 
concept of reactive intermediate stabilization by incarceration was introduced by Cram, 
Tanner and Thomas with  ‘ the taming of cyclobutadiene ’  and is outlined in Figure  9.16 .  36 
 Photolysis of a suitable, stable photochemical precursor yields the reactive intermediate 
in the inner phase. Once generated, the surrounding host prevents destructive reactions, 
such as dimerization or trapping with bulk phase reactants that are too large to pass 
through an opening in the host shell. Difﬁ cult to prevent are innermolecular reactions 
with the surrounding host, which may take place with incarcerated carbenes, nitrenes, 
radicals and arynes, thus limiting their lifetime. In the following sections, several exam-
ples will be discussed. 
 9.6.2  Cyclobutadiene 
 ‘ The taming of cyclobutadiene ’  inside  15  is the ﬁ rst example of an inner phase stabiliza-
tion of a reactive intermediate and nicely demonstrates the power of this approach (Figure 
 9.17 ). 36 Cyclobutadiene  52  is the prototypical example to verify theory of aromaticity.  37,38

It is severely angle - strained in addition to being antiaromatic.  38,39 Cram and co - workers 
generated  52 inside  15 by irradiating  α - pyrone hemicarceplex  15  53 . 
 Hemicarcerand  15  has a larger, slot - shaped opening that permits passage of  53 at 
 > 120  ° C, but retains the guest at ambient temperature. Irradiation above 300   nm converted 
 15  53  to photopyrone  15  54 , which as a solid, rearranged to  15  55 at 90  ° C. At higher 
temperature,  15  55  reverted quantitatively back to  15  53 . Controlled irradiation of 
 15  53  with unﬁ ltered UV light produced nearly quantitatively cyclobutadiene. Prolonged 
photolysis split encapsulated cyclobutadiene into acetylenes. The latter escaped the inner 
phase and could be precipitated as red cuprous acetylide. In the absence of oxygen, 
cyclobutadiene was stable up to 60    ° C! and was characterized for the ﬁ rst time by  1 H 
NMR spectroscopy. The four protons of  52  resonated at   δ  2.27, which is 3.03 ppm upﬁ eld 
from the ring proton of  56 , 40   due to the shielding effect by the aryl units of the surround-

ing host. The lifetime of incarcerated cyclobutadiene is controlled by the barrier of its 
passage through the larger opening inside  15 . If a solution of  15  52  was heated in a 
sealed tube at high temperatures, the guest escaped the protective shelter and dimerized. 
Also, oxygen, which easily passes through the host shell, trapped the guest as malealde-
hyde  58 , presumably via an intermediate dioxetane  59 . 
 9.6.3  Anti - Bredt Bridgehead Oleﬁ ns 
 The successful inner phase stabilization of cyclobutadiene suggests that this approach 
may allow stabilization of other molecules with highly strained multiple bonds. An inter-
esting class of hydrocarbons with twisted C = C bonds are  anti - Bredt bridgehead oleﬁ ns. 41 
These bicycloalkenes have a  trans  - cycloalkene and are unstable if their oleﬁ nic strain 
(OS) is  OS  ≥  21  kcal  mol  − 1 . 42 Bicyclo[2.2.2]oct - 1 - ene  60 and (Z) - bicyclo[3.2.1]oct - 1 - ene 
 61 have  OS  =  46.4 and 21.9  kcal  mol  − 1 , 42b respectively and are ﬂ eeting in solution, in part 
due to their high tendency to dimerize or rearrange,  43,44   but were recently room tempera-
ture stabilized inside hemicarcerand  4 . 45   For the inner phase synthesis of  60  and  61 , Jones ’ 
carbene route was chosen (Figure  9.18 ). Contrary to pyrolysis of  64 , 43   inner phase pho-
tolysis of diazirine  66 gave a complex product mixture composed of hemicarceplexes 
 4  60 ,  4  61 , and  4  67  and of small amounts of carbene - hemicarcerand insertion prod-
ucts. Mechanistic studies suggest, that photochemically excited  66 * directly rearranges 
to  60  and  61  without participation of carbene  63 (Figure  9.19 ). 46   Both incarcerated  anti -
 Bredt oleﬁ ns are stable at room temperature in the absence of oxygen. In aerated solution, 
they add O 2  to yield ketoaldehydes  68  and  69 . Oxidation of  4  60  is rapid at room tem-
perature, but requires days at 60    ° C in the case of  61 , which reﬂ ects their different OS. 
Trapping studies also suggested formation of small amounts of the highly strained  62 in 
the photolysis of  4  66 .  62  escaped spectroscopic detection due to its fast isomerization 
to  61 , but could be trapped with O 2 , if photolysis was carried out in aerated solution. 
 A thermal  retro - Diels – Alder reaction of  60 , which in Jones ’  seminal pyrolysis studies 
had served as indirect proof for formation of  60 , 43   could also be induced inside  4 . At 
62  ° C,  60  slowly rearranged to triene  65 , which escaped the inner phase and was identiﬁ ed 
in the bulk by its characteristic  1 H NMR spectrum. 
 9.6.4  o - Benzyne 
 The inner phase stabilization of  o - benzyne  70  inside hemicarcerand  4  uncovered some of 
the limits of the inner phase approach.  14,47   Since its discovery,  48 – 49  o - benzyne has received

much attention by the scientiﬁ c community as intermediate in organic synthesis  50 and due 
to its interesting structural and electronic properties.  51,52   Benzyne has been investigated 
in cryogenic matrices by UV/Vis - , 53 FT - IR - , 54,55   and very recently solid state NMR spec-
troscopy. 56 Chapman ﬁ rst matrix - isolated  o - benzyne by photolyzing benzocyclobutene-
dione  29 at 8  K (Figure  9.20 ). 54   The same route led to the successful inner phase synthesis 
of  o - benzyne. 47 
 Photolysis of hemicarceplex  4  29  yielded hemicarceplex  4  72 . Benzocyclopropenone 
 72  had previously been studied in solution below  − 78  ° C, where it rapidly hydrolyzed in 
the presence of moisture.  57   However, protected inside the hemicarcerand, it was stable at 
room temperature in water - saturated CDCl 3 . The proton chemical shifts of incarcerated 
 72  suggest co - alignment of its C2 axis with the C4 axis of  4  (Figure  9.21 ) such that the 
reactive C = O resides in the shielded region of the inner phase, which explains the high 
stability of the incarcerated guest.

 Further photolysis of  4  72 gave  4  70 . Due to the high   π - bond strain of 50  kcal  mol  − 1 , 58 
 o  - benzyne underwent an innermolecular Diels – Alder reaction with the surrounding  4 that 
was fast above  − 75  ° C (Figure  9.21 ). 14   This reaction is very selective and  70  adds exclu-
sively across the 1,4 - position of an aryl unit of  4 . The MM3 *  minimum energy conformer 
of  4  70 shows strong preorganization of the reactive triple bond for the observed 
Diels – Alder reaction with distances of 4.53  Å  and 4.05  Å  between the reacting carbons 
of host and guest.  59   This high preorganization is reﬂ ected in the moderately negative 
activation entropy   ∆ S  ‡  innermolecular (298  K)  =  − 10.7 cal  mol  − 1  K  − 1 . 14   Interestingly, the meas-
ured  ∆ H  ‡  innermolecular  for the innermolecular addition is slightly higher than the calculated 
 ∆ H  ‡  calc  for the addition of  70  to benzene (Figure  9.21 C).  59   Thus, the increased reactivity 
of  4 must be compensated by steric interactions in the Diels – Alder - transition state origi-
nating from a repulsion between H(1) and aryl unit A (Figure  9.21 B). This suggests that 
an incarcerated 3,6 - disubstituted  o  - benzyne may not be able to react with the host and 
may be stable at room temperature. 
 At  − 75  ° C, the Diels – Alder reaction was slow enough to record  1 H - NMR spectra of 
 4  70 . 47   Protons of  70  resonate at   δ  4.99 and   δ  4.31. Under the assumption that they feel 
the same shielding by the surrounding host as the protons of benzene, the chemical shifts 
of  ‘ free ’  o  - benzyne were estimated at   δ  7.0 and   δ  7.6 in excellent agreement to the cal-
culated shifts.  52a   Much less relatively upﬁ eld shifted are the guest  13 C - signals and provide 
more insight into the electronic properties of  o - benzyne. The measured chemical shift 
for the quaternary carbon of  70  at   δ  181.33 is within the experimental error of the 
average of the three chemical shift tensor principle values   δ  193  ±  15 of matrix isolated 
 13 C - enriched  70  at 20   K in argon.  56 The  13 C - NMR spectrum of incarcerated  o - benzyne 
also provided direct  13 C – 13 C - coupling constants. Comparison of the experimental  13 C – 
 13 C - coupling constants with the coupling constants of model compounds suggested a 
cumulenic character of  o - benzyne (Figure  9.22 ), which, however, contradicts most 
recent results of  ab initio calculations. 52a,60   These calculations predict that  o - benzyne is

character. 
 9.6.5  Phenylcarbene Rearrangement 
 The phenylcarbene rearrangement is one of the most important and fascinating carbene 
rearrangements and was studied inside hemicarcerands  4  and  13 . In the gas phase, phe-
nylcarbene (PC)  74 ring - expands to cyclohepta - 1,2,4,6 - tetraene (CHTE)  76 involving 
bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta - 1,3,5 - triene  75  as intermediate (Figure  9.23 ).  61 – 64   CHTE, a bend and 
twisted allene with 40  kcal  mol  − 1  strain energy,  64   is the local minimum on this part of the 
potential energy surface and enantiomerizes via the planar cyclohepta - 1,3,5 - trienylidene 
 77 as transition state. 63,64 
 Ring - expansion can also be triggered photochemically via excitation of triplet phenyl-
carbene  3 74 generated from phenyldiazomethane or phenyldiazirine (Figure  9.24 ). 12,65 – 69 
 However, even at 77   K, photolysis of  4  49  produced only insertion products  78 
(85% yield) and  79  (4.5%). Both formed via insertion of transient  74  into an inward 
pointing acetal C − H and linker   α - C − H bonds of  4 , respectively. The magnitude 
and temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effects of the acetal insertion, 
suggested considerable tunnelling contributions.  70   After partial deuteration of  4 , the 
kinetic isotope effect of  k H / k D  =  9.8 inside  80  slowed innermolecular insertions and 
sufﬁ ciently increased the lifetime of  3 74 , such that photochemical rearrangement to 
CHTE was possible in 17% yield and 30% yield at 77   K and 15.5   K, respectively. In 
the related inner phase  p - tolylcarbene rearrangements, the yields of 5 - methylcyclohepta -
 1,2,4.6 - tetraene were even higher. Photolysis of  4  50  and perdeuterated  81  50 at 
77  K afforded  4  82  and  81  82  in 41% and 67% yield, respectively. The higher yields 
likely have an extrinsic origin (conﬁ nement). Any carbene - host reaction, be it arylcy-
clopropanation, acetal C − H insertion or linker C − H or C − O insertion, requires tilting 
of the carbene out of its preferred orientation, in which the long axis of the carbene is 
aligned with the polar axis of the host. The greater steric demand of the methyl group

raises the barrier for  83  more than that for  74  (Figure  9.25 ). For example, the barrier 
for guest tumbling around an equatorial C2 axis of the host sharply increases in the 
order benzene  <<  toluene  <<  para - xylene. 5b,10,71 
 Both incarcerated allenes  76  and  82 , persisted for months at room temperature in the 
absence of oxygen and could be characterized by  1 H NMR spectroscopically. An inves-
tigation of their inner phase chemistry showed several interesting phenomena. Exposing 
hemicarceplex  80  CHTE to HCl gas produced instantaneously hemicarceplex 
 80  C 7 H 7 Cl. Subsequent addition of small amounts of CH 3 OH to the bulk phase, trapped 
incarcerated C 7 H 7 Cl ( 84 ) and gave quantitatively C 7 H 7 OCH 3 ( 85 ) (Figure  9.24 ). Addition 
of CH 3 OH to  80  CHTE resulted in no reaction even at elevated temperatures. This seems 
at ﬁ rst surprising since free CHTE yields C 7 H 7 OR instantaneously, if generated in the 
presence of an alcohol ROH.  72   Labeling studies support a mechanism, in which protona-
tion of cycloheptatrienylidene ( 77 ) yields an intermediate tropylium ion (  C H

inner phase,  77 lies more than 20  kcal  mol  − 1 above ground state CHTE, which explains

the inertness of  76  inside  4 . 12   However, in a polar protic solvent, the larger dipole moment 
of  77  and stabilizing carbene  … H − OR hydrogen bonds bring  77  closer in energy to 
CHTE (Figure  9.26 ). 12 
 Also interesting is the autoxidation of incarcerated CHTE in aerated solution. Under 
these conditions, oxygen diffuses into the hemicarcerand and adds to the central allene C 
to produce a spirocyclic dioxirane  86 . The latter  86  rapidly decarboxylates to benzene at 
room temperature. 
 The constrictively stabilized CHTE and MeCHTE allowed the measurement of several 
barriers of phenyl -  and tolylcarbene rearrangements, which up to then were only available 
from high level calculations and allow comparison between experiment and theory.  63,64,73,74 
In an attempt to measure the enantiomerization barrier of CHTE,  49  was photolyzed 
inside hemicarcerand  13  and produced diastereomeric hemicarceplexes  13  (+) - CHTE

for the enantiomerization barrier, which agrees with all current calculations.  63,64 For the 
corresponding MeCHTE hemicarceplexes, exchange rate constants could be extracted 
from line shape analysis of high temperature NMR spectra.  68   Furthermore, since photoly-
sis of  13  50  produced  13  (+) - MeCHTE and  13  ( − ) - MeCHTE in a ratio  =  1  :  1.15 
(de   =   7%), which substantially differed from the thermodynamic ratio   =   1   :   1.8 at room 
temperature, exchange rate constants could also be measured just below ambient 
temperature. The enantiomerization free energy of the minor and major enantiomer 
 ∆ G  ‡  (minor)  =  20.3  kcal  mol  − 1  and   ∆ G  ‡  (minor)  =  20.6  kcal  mol  − 1  agreed with estimates 
from DFT calculations (  ∆ G  ‡   =  20.0  kcal  mol  − 1 ; B3LYP/6 - 311G * * ). 
 At elevated temperature, the lifetime of incarcerated MeCHTE strongly decreased due 
to ring - contraction resulting in  p - and  m - tolylcarbene (TC) formation (Figure  9.27 ). The 
latter react instantaneously with the surrounding hemicarcerand. A careful analysis of 
rates and products of these ring - contractions gave activation parameters for the MeCHTE 
to  m  -  and MeCHTE to  p  - TC rearrangements. Again, both activation free energies agreed 
very well with those calculated at the B3LYP/6 - 311G *  *  level of theory.  73 Also, the inner 
phase and computed activation enthalpy and entropy for the MeCHTE to  p - TC matched 
very well. Very interesting, however, is the large enthalpy - entropy compensation in the 
inner phase MeCHTE to  m - TC rearrangement. This enthalpy - entropy compensation was 
interpreted with a hemicarcerand and solvent reorganization as a consequence of a dra-
matic change in the guest shape along the reaction coordinate and is taken as indirect 
evidence for the intermediacy of  87 in this rearrangement (Figure  9.27 ). 
 This example illustrates nicely how kinetic experiments in conﬁ ned space allow 
mapping of potential energy surfaces of important organic chemical processes involving 
highly reactive intermediates, which is difﬁ cult to achieve with other techniques such as 
laser ﬂ ash photolysis, CID or matrix isolation.

 9.6.6  Carbenes 
 In the previous chapter, we have seen that incarcerated phenylcarbene rapidly inserts into 
C − H bonds of hemicarcerands even at 77  K. 12,67   Such high reactivity is expected and 
typical for alkyl or arylcarbenes.  75   However, the stability and reactivity of carbenes 
R − C − R ′  depends on the nature of the substituent R and R ′  and can be tailored.  76,77 
Heteroatoms strongly stabilize the singlet state through electron donation and many 
diaminocarbenes are stable and isolable at room temperature.  78   In cases, where intrinsic 
stabilization (e - donation) is not sufﬁ cient, extrinsic effects (incarceration), may render an 
otherwise ﬂ eeting singlet carbene stable under normal conditions. Fluorophenoxycarbene 
 89  is such specie and was recently room temperature stabilized by incarceration (Figure 
 9.28 ). 79,80   Both substituents stabilize  89  by  ∼ 60  kcal  mol  − 1  compared to methylene.  77 Yet, 
 89 , if photochemically generated from diazirine  90 , is ﬂ eeting at room temperature and 
instantaneously dimerizes, reacts with moisture or is trapped in the presence of alkenes.  81 
 Liu  et al . generated incarcerated  89  by irradiation of ﬂ uorophenoxydiazirine hemi-
carceplex  4  90  at low temperature.  79 Incarcerated  89  persisted for weeks at room 
temperature. The  13 C and  19 F NMR spectra of  4  89  provided interesting insight into 
the electronic properties of  9 . The carbenic carbon resonated at   δ  285.7 ppm, which 
compares well to chemical shifts of other persistent heteroatom substituted carbenes.  78 
The strongly downﬁ eld shifted ﬂ uorine, the unusually large  19 F – 13 C coupling constant 
and the considerable upﬁ eld shift of the  ipso  carbon of  89  relative to that of  90 point 
towards strong participation of both O and F atoms in the carbene stabilization through 
push – push effects.

251
 The NMR spectroscopic investigations also showed that incarceration had a strong 
effect on the conformational preference of  89  (Figure  9.29 ). Contrary to gas phase  ab 
initio  calculations, which predict  trans - 89  as the lower energy conformation, the confor-
mational equilibrium is reversed in the inner phase. Thus, conﬁ nement favors the coiled 
and more compact  cis  -  over the extended  trans  conformation, which is consistent with 
the observations of coiled linear alkane conformations in self - assembled molecular 
capsules. 82 
 In the presence of trace amounts of acid, incarcerated  89  slowly reacted with water in 
the bulk phase to yield phenylformate hemicarceplex  4  91  and phenyl diﬂ uoromethyl 
ether hemicarceplex  4  92  (Figure  9.29 ). The requirement of acid catalysis in the inner 
phase water trapping reaction is surprising since catalysis is not required for free  89 . This 
suggests that the water - trapping of  89  is initiated by protonation and that water is not 
acidic enough in the inner phase contrary to the bulk phase. The hydrophobicity of the 
inner phase and lack of solvation of the hypothetical ion pair [ 89 H] + [OH]  −  are likely 
reasons for the absence of this acid base reaction similar to the examples discussed in 
section  9.4.1 .This shows that, incarceration not only prevents dimerization of  89 , but also 
slows trapping reactions with water by many orders of magnitude. 
 9.6.7  Phenylnitrene 
 Very recently, phenylnitrene (PN) and its intramolecular rearrangement have been inves-
tigated inside hemicarcerand  4 . 83   PN is an important reactive intermediate for organic 
synthesis and photoafﬁ nity labeling of biomacromolecules. 84 It is isoelectronic with 
phenylcarbene (PC) and undergoes very similar intramolecular chemistry.  61c,85,86 Above 
 − 100  ° C,  1 PN rapidly ring - expands to the highly strained cyclic ketenimine  95 , which can 
be trapped with amines or other nucleophiles. Below  − 100  ° C,  1 PN intersystem crosses 
to triplet  3 PN (Figure  9.30 ). 
 Though at ﬁ rst glance PN and PC show great similarity in their chemistry, their reactiv-
ity differs dramatically, which has been subject of extensive investigations over the past 
decades and reﬂ ects itself in the inner phase chemistry of both species. For example, in 
solution  1 PN ring - expands rapidly at room temperature to  95  in the sub - nanosecond time 
scale, whereas ring - expansion of  1 PC can only be observed at elevated temperatures in

the gas phase due to the substantially higher activation energy and the higher intermo-
lecular reactivity of  1 PC. 73,87 
 As a consequence,  1 PC does not rearrange to CHTE, if generated inside  4 . 12,67 Ring -
 expansion cannot compete with the much faster insertion into hemicarcerand bonds. The 
situation is different for  1 PN, in which case intramolecular pathways (intersystem crossing 
and ring - expansion) are much faster than reactions with the hemicarcerand. Thus, pho-
tolysis of incarcerated phenylazide at  − 86  ° C, at which temperature ring - expansion is 
faster than intersystem crossing, produced  4  95 , whose  13 C NMR spectrum could be 
recorded for the ﬁ rst time (Figure  9.31 ).  83a   At this temperature, incarcerated  95 slowly 
decayed within 5 hours to triplet  3 PN by ring - contraction and intersystem crossing, allow-
ing for a precise determination of the activation parameters of this process. If the photoly-
sis was carried out in THF/water 8   :   1,  95 could be trapped with water as lactam  99 . 
 The inner phase photolysis studies of  4  94  uncovered a novel photochemical reaction 
of  95 . 83b   Under the photolysis conditions,  95  underwent efﬁ cient photochemical electro-
cyclization to the  anti - Bredt imine  100 , which at  − 5  ° C thermally rearranged via a 1,5 - 
shift to the slightly more stable 1 - azaspiro[2.4]hepta - 1,4,6 - triene  101 .

253
 The reactivity and life - time of triplet  3 PN and triplet PC differed remarkably in the 
inner phase of  4 . Whereas PC reacts with  4  already at 15   K and persist probably only a 
few minutes at this temperature,  12,67   the lifetime of incarcerated  3 PN is 13.6  min at  − 3  ° C. 83b 
Both  3 PC and  3 PN preferentially insert into inward pointing acetal C - H bonds of  4 to 
produce  78  and  102 , respectively (Figures  9.24  and  9.31 ). The difference in reactivity 
towards C − H insertion between triplet carbenes and an isoelectronic triplet nitrenes is 
well known and has been explained with a nitrogen rehybridization in the rate limiting 
H - abstraction step of the nitrene. Rehybridization is not needed in the carbene reaction.  61c,86 
 C − H Insertion reactions involving free phenylnitrene are essentially impossible to 
study in solution by laser ﬂ ash photolysis since C − H insertion cannot compete with 
dimerization, which is orders of magnitude faster.  88 Thus, conﬁ ning  3 PN inside the 
molecular container, which eliminates dimerization, provides an elegant way to explore 
this important type of chemistry and allowed for the ﬁ rst time an accurate measurement 
of the activation parameters of a C − H insertion involving  3 PN. 89 
 9.6.8  Norrish Type II Photochemistry 
 Sherman and co - workers recently investigated the photochemistry of butyrophenone  103 
in the inner phase of carcerand  104 (Figure  9.32 ). 90 
 The photochemistry of arylalkylketones is rich and important to organic synthesis.  91 
Photochemical reactions of arylalkylketones typically arise from the triplet  3 ( n ,   π * ) state. 
If a   γ  - hydrogen is present, as for  103 , the excited state abstracts the   γ - hydrogen through 
a cyclic six - membered transition state (Norrish Type II photochemistry). The resulting 
1,4 - biradical disproportionates back to  103 , cyclizes to cyclobutanol  107  (Yang product) 
and/or  β - fragments to ene  106  and enol  105  (Norrish Type II cleavage), which ketonizes 
in solution. The modulation of both photochemical processes through conﬁ nement has 
always been of great interests to supramolecular photochemists. 92 
 Irradiation of  103  inside carcerand  104  gave a 5.6   :   1 mixture of Norrish Type II cleav-
age products  105  and  106  and Yang product  107 , which is very similar to the ratio found 
in solution. On the other hand, incarcerated hexyrophenone was completely stable to 
irradiation even though it shows similar photoreactivity as  103  in solution. The inertness 
of  105  is a result of its inner phase conformation, in which the distance between   γ - protons 
and carbonyl oxygen precludes abstraction. 
 Both Norrish Type II photoproducts remained incarcerated. Furthermore, the surround-
ing host prevented ketonization of  105 , which requires acid or base catalysis. In fact, the 
resistance of incarcerated photoenol to ketonize is remarkable. Incarcerated  105 required

heating to 100  ° C in water - saturated nitrobenzene to yield acetophenone  108 . The extrapo-
lated life time of  15  105  +  106  at room temperature was more than seven orders of 
magnitude higher than that of free  105 . 
 An analysis of the kinetics and product distribution of ketonization in D 2 O saturated 
nitrobenzene gave interesting insight into the mechanism of inner phase ketonization 
(Figure  9.33 ). Ketonization showed biphasic kinetics and is initiated by deprotonation of 
 105 ( I  →  II ). Ion pair  II  either collapses back to  105 ( I ) or forward to acetophenone ( III ). 
 The slow rate of inner phase ketonization is likely a result of a very high energy barrier 
associated with the formation of the ion pair in the hydrophobic and only weekly  ‘ solvat-
ing ’  inner cavity of  104 . The inner phase mechanism is consistent with that proposed by 
Kresge for the uncatalyzed ketonization of free  105 . 93   However, in the inner phase com-
peting proton transfer to the enolate O ( II  →  I ) or C ( II  →  III ) have similar rates, whereas 
the latter step is rate determining in the ketonization of free  105 .Thus, the inner phase 
perturbs the mechanism by substantially raising both barriers and by making them com-
parable in magnitude. 
 9.6.9  Incarcerated Excited States 
 In section  9.3.2 , we have seen that spectral shifts of incarcerated guests can provide insight 
into the electronic and spatial characteristics of the inner phase. Of special interest to the 
photophysical community are also excited state lifetimes of molecules enclosed in con-
strained media.  94   Investigation of these systems may lead to the development of novel 
photophysical probes for immunoassays and devices for information storage or 
solar - energy conversion. Parola  et al . investigated the photophysical properties of 9 - 
cyanoanthracene (CA) inside hemicarcerand  26 (Figures  9.3 and  9.34 ). 95 
 They observed major differences in the photophysical properties of CA upon incarcera-
tion. The surrounding host lead to a red - shift of the absorption spectrum and reduced the

lifetime of the singlet exited state  1 L a  by a factor of 40. In addition, the ﬂ uorescence 
quantum yield was 50 times smaller for incarcerated CA compared to free CA. Since 
guest emission bands and host absorption bands didn ’ t overlap, energy transfer quenching 
from the host to the guest can be ruled out. Parola  et al . concluded that quenching most 
likely takes place by electron transfer from the methoxybenzene units of  26  and that such 
electron transfer would be exothermic. Further studies from this group and independently 
by Farr á n and Deshayes with triplet sensitizer biacetyl incarcerated in  14  and  12 provided 
insight into the role of host and solvent on the lifetime of triplet excited states.  18,96 
Typically, the life - time of triplet excited states depends on the rates of non - radiative 
intersystem crossing (ISC), phosphorescence and of intermolecular quenching via elec-
tron transfer, energy transfer or H - abstraction. In the absence of intermolecular quenching 
processes, the T 1  excited state lifetime of biacetyl increases in the order gas phase, inner 
phase of  14 , liquid phase. This was interpreted with incarcerated biacetyl being in a not 
too tight cavity, which provides more free space with less speciﬁ c cage – guest interactions 
than a solvent cage, but causes still a higher number of excited state – host collisions 
compared to the gas phase. 
 The lifetime of incarcerated biacetyl is unaffected by the solvent as long as it doesn ’ t 
contain heavy atoms. 18 Interestingly, halogenated solvents enhance intersystem crossing 
via a remote external heavy atom effect. This was demonstrated by Romanova  et al . for 
hemicarceplex  12  biacetyl (Figure  9.35 ). 97,98 
 It is well known, that ISC is strongly enhanced in molecules with covalently linked 
atoms of high atomic number (internal heavy atom effect). 99,100 Solvents containing heavy 
atoms, such as halides, also enhance ISC. Such external solvent heavy atom effects are 
believed to require direct contact between chromophore and perturbing molecule.  99,101 
Contrary to this believe, Romanova  et al . measured a pronounced decrease in the phos-
phorescence lifetime of incarcerated triplet biacetyl upon changing the solvent from 
benzene to CH 2 Cl 2  to CHBr 3  to CH 2 I 2 . 97 In CH 2 I 2 , the phosphorescence lifetime was 
7 - fold shorter than in benzene. The shielding of the guest from direct contact with bulk

components shows that long - distance spin – orbit coupling is possible through the walls 
of the hemicarcerand (Figure  9.35 ). This conclusion is further supported by the excellent 
agreement between the measured increase in the ISC rate induced by the external heavy 
atom effect upon switching from CHBr 3  to CH 2 I 2  and that computed based on the current 
theory of ISC induced by intermolecular spin – orbit coupling. 102,103 
 9.6.10  Photoelectron and Triplet Energy Transfer 
 Triplet excited state quenching by photoelectron transfer (PET) and energy transfer (ET) 
play a central role in biological photosynthesis,  104 visual transduction, 105 organic photo-
chemistry, 106   semiconductor photocatalysis and imaging.  107 – 109   PET and ET across the 
insulating walls of a hemicarcerand have recently been studied in order to improve our 
understanding of these photophysical processes. 98

 The dependence of the rate constant for photoinduced electron transfer k PET  on the 
driving force and reorganization energies is similar. Equation 4 predicts a parabolic 
dependence of log  k ET  on the driving force. At  − ∆ G  =  (  λ s  +   λ v ),  k ET  is largest and decreases 
at smaller (normal region) and more exothermic driving force (inverted region). The 
experimental observation of the Marcus inverted region for electron or energy transfer 
between non - covalently linked triplet excited state/quencher pairs has been very difﬁ cult 
mainly because ET and PET transfer at high driving forces is much faster than the rate 
of diffusional encounter. In the encounter complexes of the hemicarceplex/quencher 
systems (Host  G(T 1 ) … .Q(S 0 ) and Host  G(T 1 ) … .Q) excited state and quencher are 
separated by about 7  Å . As a consequence of a strong distance dependence,  111b,114 ET and 
PET are substantially slower than diffusion, which has made observation of the inverted 
region possible in these systems  96,110,115   In their seminal work on through space triplet ET, 
Deshayes and co - workers studied acetophenone (AC) hemicarceplex  14  Ac and probed 
through - shell triplet ET chemically via the isomerization of  cis - piperylene to  trans - pip-
erylene (Figure  9.36 ). 116

 From a Stern – Volmer analysis and the lifetimes of free and incarcerated triplet ace-
tophenone, Deshayes determined a 2.7 - fold slower triplet ET rate for  14  Ac compared 
to free acetophenone. This corresponds to an almost diffusion controlled rate for  14  Ac. 
Since triplet energy is transferred through an electron exchange mechanism, which is 
believed to require a close contact between donor and acceptor, sufﬁ cient overlap of the 
HOMO and LUMO of the donor - acceptor pair through the host - shell must exist. Whether 
the intervening hemicarcerand plays a role in the through - space ET is not clear. As an 
extension of this work, Farr á n and Deshayes studied triplet ET between incarcerated 
biacetyl ( 14  biacetyl) and various bulk phase acceptors.  96   In all cases, hemicarcerand  14 
retarded triplet ET, which suggests a reduced electron - coupling between donor and accep-
tor as a result of their larger separation. Also, log  k ET  and   ∆ G showed a hyperbolic rela-
tionship as predicted by the Golden Rule. 
 Also interesting is the extremely slow triplet ET rate to O 2 , which is typically a highly 
efﬁ cient quencher. Farr á n and Deshayes concluded that when oxygen is prevented from 
coming into direct contact with the donor, the quenching rate drops off drastically. Parola 
 et al . independently measured triplet ET rates from  14  biacetyl to those quenchers used 
by Deshayes and several others and agreed with Deshayes that the difference between  k ET 
of free and incarcerated biacetyl results from different electronic exchange matrix ele-
ments  v . 110   However, they were careful in taking the observed parabolic like relationship 
as ﬁ rm evidence for inverted behavior especially since their data were strongly scattered. 
A parabolic - like correlation may simply reﬂ ect non - homogeneity of the quenchers, as a 
consequence of their different sizes, which leads to different donor - acceptor distances 
and/or orientations and hence to different values for  v . Most likely for the same reason, 
evidence for the inverted region could not be found for quenching of  14  biacetyl by 
electron transfer from bulk phase aromatic amine donors. 
 In a subsequent investigation, Deshayes and Piotrowiak provided clear support for the 
parabolic Marcus relationship and explained the original data by Farr á n and Deshayes 
and Parola  et al . in a quantitative manner by taking into account the different internal 
nuclear reorganization energies   λ v  of the acceptors.  115   According to MO calculations,   λ v 
varies by more than 20  kcal  mol  − 1 among the different acceptors. As a consequence, two 
acceptors with nearly identical driving forces and transfer rates may belong to different 
regions of Marcus parabola. This is the case for dibromoanthracene (DBA) and diphe-
nylbutadiene (DPB) (Figure  9.37 ). Both were assigned to the correct region of a Marcus 
parabola based on their activation energy of transfer, which is negative for the former

(typical for the inverted region), but positive for the latter (normal region behavior). 
Deshayes and Piotrowiak identiﬁ ed four groups of acceptors. (1) Rigid aromatics that 
display small   λ v . (2) Acyclic oleﬁ ns that twist around the double bond upon triplet excita-
tion and therefore have large   λ v . (3) Cyclic oleﬁ ns with even larger   λ v  and (4) O 2 , which 
has essentially no   λ v . Each acceptor group has its own log   k ET  versus   ∆ G correlation 
(Figure  9.37 ). The remaining scattering in the experimental data may result from differ-
ences in size and shape of the acceptors, leading to different effective electronic couplings 
in the corresponding encounter complexes and possibly also to different encounter 
frequencies. 
 The investigation detailed above were mainly concerned with the dependence of triplet 
ET rate on   ∆ G and   λ v  and provided clear support for the inverted region. As pointed out 
earlier, electronic coupling between donor and acceptor is strongly reduced upon separat-
ing them by an intervening hemicarcerand, leading to a slowing of energy and electron 
transfer. In a more recent investigation, Deshayes and Piotrowiak addressed dependence 
of electronic coupling between incarcerated biacetyl and the bulk phase quencher on the 
hemicarcerand size.  20   The electronic coupling between incarcerated biacetyl and the 
acceptor can be described by a simple superexchange mechanism and viewed as a 
sequence of guest – hemicarcerand and hemicarcerand – solute interactions. Thus, the total 
electronic coupling matrix element   ν total  is the product of that for the guest – hemicarcerand 
 ν GH and the hemicarcerand – acceptor interaction   ν HA :

 Hemicarceplexes  4  biacetyl,  15  biacetyl and  14  biacetyl, which vary in size and 
linker characteristics, were included in this study.  k ET  increased with decreasing host size 
in the order k ET ( 4 )  <  k ET ( 14 )  <<  k ET ( 15 ). The average electronic coupling matrix elements 
showed the same trend and are |  ν ( 4 )|  =  0.20 cm  − 1 , |  ν ( 14 )|  =  0.26 cm  − 1 , and |  ν ( 15 )|  =  
0.66 cm  − 1 . Since   ν HA  should be independent of the hemicarcerand size, the differences in 
 ν total reﬂ ect differences in the guest – hemicarcerand electronic couplings   ν HA  among the 
hosts.  ν total was slightly higher for ET to neat acceptors. However, the trends were the 
same and   ν HA  differences measured in neat acceptors were identical to those measured in 
acceptor solutions. These trends are consistent with predictions. The time - averaged guest –
 hemicarcerand interaction should depend on the size of the cavity and should increase 
with decreasing cavity. One can also conclude, that the  o - xylylene linkers in  14 don ’ t 
cause special enhancement of electronic coupling. 
 These investigations not only unraveled the inﬂ uence of the hemicarcerand on the 
mechanism of through - shell triplet ET, but also contribute to the understanding of solvent -
 mediated electron transfer,  117,118   in which a solvent molecule separates donor and acceptor 
and provides the pathway for electronic coupling. Since the thickness of a hemicarcerand 
is comparable to that of common organic solvents, the measured electronic coupling 
matrix elements are good estimates for the magnitude of solvent - mediated contributions 
to electronic coupling in triplet excitation transfer.

processes and have allowed experimental veriﬁ cation of theoretical models. These studies 
also form the basis for application of hemicarceplexes in the fabrication of nanodevices 
for solar energy conversion. 108   Deshayes and Piotrowiak recently studied the photophysi-
cal properties of hemicarceplex  109  azulene immobilized onto the surface of TiO 2 
nanoparticles via its eight peripheral carboxylic groups.  119   Immobilization led to nearly 
complete quenching of the azulene ﬂ uorescence emission, which suggests efﬁ cient ET 
from the excited state to the conducting band of TiO 2 . The time constant for electron 
injection was about 1000 - times slower than that for the 1 - or 2 - carboxyazulene immobi-
lized on TiO 2 . Also, back - electron transfer  109  azulene + /TiO 2  –   →  109  azulene/TiO 2 
was strongly retarded by about the same factor (Figure  9.38 ). Interestingly, the latter 
kinetics could be described with a single exponential in contrast to the 1 - carboxyazulene/
TiO 2  and other dye/TiO 2 systems, 120   for which multi - exponential behavior is observed as 
a consequence of inhomogeneity of binding and presence of surface traps. The homogene-
ous recombination kinetics indicates that tunnelling across the hemicarcerand walls is the 
rate - limiting step of back - electron transfer and that the slow tunneling averages out the 
large distribution of rates that are normally seen. Thus, non - covalent immobilization of 
dye molecules through encapsulation inside a TiO 2  bound hemicarcerand, not only 
increases the lifetime of the charge separated state but also leads to a more homogeneous 
system with respect to the kinetic of charge recombination. It remains to be seen how 
these photophysical properties affect the properties of photovoltaic devices synthesized 
from dye - hemicarceplex/TiO 2 hybrid assemblies. 
 9.7  Conclusions and Outlook 
 This review shows that the inner phase of molecular container compounds are interest-
ing new conﬁ ned environments, in which a large variety of different reactions have 
been carried out and new once have been discovered. Moreover, molecular container 
compounds have become real tools for physical organic chemists to study reaction 
mechanism and long - distance phenomena. Molecular containers made possible the 
investigation of highly strained and reactive molecules under normal working condi-
tions by generating them in the protective inner phase. They also allowed the inves-
tigation of electronic interactions between encapsulated and bulk phase molecules 
through the intervening hemicarcerand and have provided experimental support for 
theoretical models of long distance spin - orbit coupling, electron and energy transfer. 
It is anticipated that this ﬁ eld of research will further grow and that the recent devel-
opment of multi - cavitand nanocapsules 7b,121   will make possible the investigation of 
chemical reactivity of macromolecular guests that are of interest to material and bio-
logical sciences.

Encapsulation of Reactive 
Intermediates

 10.1  Introduction 
 The inclusion of molecules is a very common technique in the pharmaceutical sciences 
to protect sensitive compounds and increase their usability and their storage time. For 
example, drugs were enclosed in host molecules like cyclodextrins. This topic has been 
previously reviewed. 1 
 The same approach can be applied to organic chemistry where very labile species can 
be encapsulated. In this way, species that usually would rapidly decompose or polymerize 
even at low temperatures can be stored at room temperature, especially when the guest 
has no chance to escape from its host. To achieve this goal, hemicarcerands have been 
mostly used, leading to the preparation of cages containing highly reactive species such 
as 1,3 - cyclobutadiene, cycloheptatetraene, or benzyne. This subject is presented in detail 
in a specially dedicated chapter (Reactions inside Carcerands, Ralf Warmuth). 
 Similarly, very useful results can be obtained if the labile species is not incarcerated 
but can easily be released from its cage. Obviously, this property is signiﬁ cant in order 
to have a chance to use the guest or its products. In this section, we will ﬁ rst present what 
can be done to increase the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of a labile species with 
the aim to increase its relative concentration during the reaction or to make it more per-
sistent. Second, we will show a few examples to demonstrate how to stabilize some

speciﬁ c noncovalent assemblies and to enforce a change in the conformation of the guest. 
Finally, the focus will be put on highly reactive intermediates (radicals, radical cations, 
carbenes, and nitrenes) showing how to protect them from the surroundings in order to 
prevent their trapping but also to modify their reactivity to be able to obtain products that 
would not be found otherwise. Taking examples from the supramolecular chemistry of 
carbenes and nitrenes, more details will be given about the methodology used in these 
studies. 
 10.2  Encapsulation of Labile Species 
 The following results show some recent improvements toward the possibility to carry out 
water sensitive reactions in aqueous solution using hydrophobic catalysts. 
 The ﬁ rst example concerns the attempt to isolate a common reactive intermediate. An 
ordinary easily occurring reaction is the addition of primary amines to carbonyl groups 
to form imines. The main intermediate of this condensation reaction is a hemiaminal 
which can be observed only in special cases because the release of water proceeds very 
rapidly. A cavitand could be built which is able to increase the concentration of hemi-
aminal during the reaction and allows its observation by NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 
 10.1 ). 2 Cavitand  1a  is based on a resorcinarene - based bowl, a macrocycle easily available

by condensation of resorcinol with aldehydes under acidic conditions. Usually, long chain 
aldehydes are used to improve the solubility of the container. The hydroxy groups on the 
upper rim offer the possibility to deepen the cavity and to introduce a large variety of 
functionalities. In the case of  la , the upper rim has been functionalized with an anthracene 
arm bearing an aldehyde group and with amido groups to obtain a rigid vase conformation 
ﬁ rmly maintained by intramolecular hydrogen bonds. In mesitylene, a solvent too large 
to be accommodated in the cavity and therefore not competiting for inclusion, various 
small amines  2  can be complexed. Formation of the hemiaminal  3  is relatively fast but 
the elimination of water to afford imine  4  is slowed. In solution, dehydration is induced 
by a second amine molecule. Due to the conﬁ nement in a limited space, this step is ham-
pered. Thus, the hemiaminal accumulates and its concentration declines only slowly over 
time with a half life of 30 to 90  min. 
 This strategy has been expanded to the observation of isoimide intermediates  5 . 
Isoimides are obtained by a formal insertion of isonitriles into the OH bond of carboxylic 
acids. Usually, high temperatures are required and the addition product is rapidly stabi-
lized by a 1,3 -  O → N  acyl transfer to form  N - acylformamide  6 . 3   Under these conditions, 
no signiﬁ cant amounts of isoimide  5  are present in the solution during the reaction. 
However, the previously described cavitand  1a , after oxidation to carboxylic acid  1b , can 
be used to reveal the intermediacy of the isoimide (Scheme  10.2 ).  4 Addition of isopropyl 
isonitrile to a solution of cavitand  1b in mesitylene - d 12  induces the folding of the host to 
its vase conformation and inclusion of the guest in direct proximity to the acidic group. 
In this conﬁ ned space, addition occurs at room temperature and the isoimide intermediate 
 5  can be observed by NMR and IR spectroscopy at millimolar concentrations before 
completion of the rearrangement to acylformamide  6 . 
 One of the most remarkable contributions is the generation of iminium ions in water 
in good yields combined with the ability to conserve these ions for months in this solu-
tion. Iminium ions are easily formed by the condensation of secondary amines with 
carbonyl groups in an equilibrium reaction. However, they are very sensitive to hydro-
lyses and are not viable in water except if they are suitably encapsulated. The water 
soluble self - assembled  Ga L
4

12− complex  5   is a suitable container for this purpose (Scheme 
 10.3 ). 6   The four gallium ions are bridged by six bis - bidentate catecholamide ligands L 
forming a 12 - fold negatively charged tetrahedron. This assembly is a perfect host for 
organic cations. Indeed, stirring a mixture of ketone, pyrrolidine ( 7 ), and   Ga L
4

12− leads 
to the inclusion of the corresponding iminium ions  8 . Obviously, the generation of a suit-
able guest and its inclusion constitute a sufﬁ cient driving force to shift the equilibrium

toward the iminium product. The best yields are obtained with pentanones and hexanones 
(80 – 90%) due to an optimal ﬁ t of the size of the guest in the hydrophobic cavity. 
 An analogous approach is the stabilization of phosphonium ions by addition of phos-
phanes (PMe 3 , PEt 3 , PPhMe 2 , and PPh 2 Me) to methyl ketones (acetone, methyl ethyl 
ketone, 1,1,1 - triﬂ uoroacetone, and ﬂ uoroacetone) in an aqueous solution of   Ga L

(Scheme  10.4 ). 7   These cations decompose in water but they are persistent for weeks in 
the nanovessel. However, this stability is pH - dependant. The pH should be low because 
the guest should be protonated and is regularly exposed to the bulk of water as a conse-
quence of the dynamic behavior of the assembly, but the pH should not be too low because 
in that case the host would disassemble. Therefore, the optimal value is 5.2. The exact 
mechanism is still unknown; it has been ascertained that the protonated phosphane can 
be encapsulated but it is not possible to determine where the addition to the ketone occurs, 
inside or outside the cavity. Due to the chirality of the   Ga L
4
6
12− tetrahedron, a kinetic 
diastereoselectivity is also obtained with chiral ions leading to diastereomeric excesses 
of 30 – 50%. 
 The effect of encapsulation can be quite impressive. White phosphorus (P 4 tetrahe-
drons), a strongly pyrophoric compound, spontaneously burns when exposed to air releas-
ing considerable amounts of energy deriving from the release of strain and the replacement 
of the weak P − P bonds by strong P − O bonds. Under inclusion in the self - assembled 
tetrahedral cage   Fe L

water in the presence of oxygen (Scheme  10.5 ).  8   The cage is formed by stirring 2 - formylpy-
ridine ( 9 ) with 4,4 ′ - diaminobiphenyl - 2,2 ′ - disulfonic acid ( 10 ) in the presence of iron(II)

has a purple color and is diamagnetic because iron(II) is in its low spin state. With a 
cavity volume of 140    Å 3 , it encloses preferably small cyclic hydrocarbons but no organic 
cations, probably because of its small total charge. The cage dissociates back to its build-
ing block in a reversible manner at low pH as a consequence of protonation of the ligands. 
It can also be irreversibly decomposed by addition of a chelating amine resulting in an 
imine exchange reaction.  10   The preparation of the complex is achieved by mixing an

−. The decrease in reactivity is not 
mainly due to exclusion of dioxygen from P 4  as the dynamic nature of the host and the 
small size of dioxygen do not allow obtaining a strict separation of the reactant. The main 
reason is that the reaction products and intermediates are too large to ﬁ t into the cavity. 
However, this dynamic inclusion has one important advantage: the reactive guest can 
easily be released by extraction with benzene or cyclohexane where P 4  can exhibit its 
reactivity and be oxidized to ﬁ nally give phosphoric acid H 3 PO 4 . In this case, the removal 
of P 4  is performed by using a competing guest for the cavity; with  n - heptane, the extrac-
tion is not successful. 
 A further example concerns the isolation of cyclic trimers of siloxanes.  11 These cyclic 
trimers are usually short - lived kinetic products generated during the ﬁ rst phase of the 
polycondensation of trisilanols.  12   In a bulk, they usually further condense to higher oli-
gomers which are thermodynamically more stable and therefore, these trimers cannot be 
isolated. However, when the condensation of phenyltrimethoxysilane PhSi(OMe) 3 is 
performed in the   M L
6
4
12+ nanocage  12 , only the cyclic trimer  14  is obtained under stereo-
chemistry control giving exclusively the all - cis isomer (Scheme  10.6 ). 
 Nanocage  12  is a stable complex which can easily be prepared in boiling water by 
self - assembly of 6 units of a platinum nitrate salt with 4 molecules of a tris(4 - pyridyl)
triazine  11  panel as ligand. The holes between the panels are sufﬁ ciently large to allow 
solvents and small molecules like PhSi(OMe) 3  to enter or exit the cage. At 100    ° C in an 
aqueous solution of capsule  12 , PhSi(OMe) 3  is hydrolyzed within ﬁ ve minutes to trisilanol 
 13 . The large cavity of  12  encloses three or four molecules of  13  at once forming the 
complex ( 13 ) 3 – 4 @ 12  which can be monitored by NMR. The condensation takes place in 
the cavity until trimer  14  is formed. However,  14  is too bulky to escape or to condense 
further. The reaction is then stopped at this level and  14  imprisoned in cage  12  can be 
isolated in 92% yield by ﬁ ltration and recrystallization. The complex  14 @ 12  is now stable 
in an aqueous solution and even under acidic conditions (pH  <  1). 
 Using this methodology, the size and shape of the cavity determines which oligomer 
will be isolated (Scheme  10.7 ). Indeed, bowl  16  produces dimer  19  whereas the small 
coordination tube  21 , which allows the complexation of only one molecule of the reactant, 
affords monomer  18 , a silanetriol.  13   In this case, starting from 4 equiv of 3,5 - bis(3 - pyridyl)
pyridine  20  and 6 equiv of Pd(en)(NO 3 ) 2 , tube  21  can only be prepared  in situ  by means

of the template effect of 2 - naphthyltrimethoxylsilane  17  forming complex  17 @ 21 . 
Aromatic compound  17  is a very suitable guest due to strong   π – π  and CH – π interaction 
between its naphthyl group and the pyridyl panels. At this temperature,  17  slowly hydro-
lyzes to  18  as revealed by monitoring of the reaction by NMR. Prolonged heating gives 
 18 @ 21 , a complex in which only the hydrophobic naphthyl group is deeply included in 
the tube. The hydrophilic Si(OH) 3  group is still exposed outside the cavity but the steri-
cally demanding tube framework prevents further polycondensation. Moreover, these 
experiments demonstrate that full enclosure of the reactive center in a cage is not always 
necessary to stabilize an intermediate and partial inclusion can be sufﬁ cient.  18 @ 21 was 
isolated in very good yield (92%), recrystallized from water, and submitted to X - ray 
analysis. 
 10.3  Isolation of Non - covalently Bonded Aggregates 
 In absence of a suitable guest molecule, in general the cavities are ﬁ lled with solvent 
molecules. Usually, several of these small compounds are enclosed in the inner space and 
are relatively loosely bonded and disordered. Using as a host the coordination cage

ordered adamantanoid (H 2 O) 10  cluster has been obtained; this structure corresponds to the 
basic unit of I 6 - type ice (Figure  10.1 ). 14   The structure could be revealed by an X - ray dif-
fraction study at  − 180  ° C. The position of the hydrogen atoms was determined by single -
 crystal neutron diffraction at room temperature with crystals prepared from D 2 O. In this 
case, the recognition of the molecular ice by the cage is quite peculiar because it does

12+ cage  22b . This highly ordered structure of the water cluster is quite stable: 
it is still not molten at room temperature. 
 Similarly, encapsulation favors the formation of stable hydrogen - bonded dimers. In 
aqueous solution, the hydrophobic cavity protects the hydrogen bonds between the pair 
from the concurrence of the water molecules. For example, four base pairs are required 
for the stable association of two DNA strands in water. In a cage, only one pair of nucle-
otide is necessary to achieve a selective binding as demonstrated by the formation of a 
hydrogen - bonded aggregate between 5 ′ - adenosine monophosphate  24 and 5 ′ - uridine 
monophosphate  25  resulting in the preferred formation of complex  24.25 @ 23 over 
( 24 ) 2 @ 23  and ( 25 ) 2 @ 23 (Scheme  10.8 ). 15   This selectivity is due to the fact that the 
nucleobases cannot efﬁ ciently form hydrogen bridges with themselves. The pillared cage 
 23  is an appropriate host because it possesses a ﬂ at hydrophobic pocket perfectly suited 
for the binding of planar aromatic guests as a result of an ideal interplanary distance 
between the panels (6.6    Å ).  23  is obtained by self - assembly of two tris(4 - pyridyl)triazine 
and three 1,4 - pyrazine ligands with six Pt(en)(NO 3 ) 2  edges in the presence of coronene 
as an aromatic template. 
 Structures held together by metal - metal  d – d  interaction can also be prepared using 
encapsulation. Inﬁ nite stacking of metal complexes is quite common in the solid or in the

mize the interactions with the twisted dimer of Pt(acac) 2 . Evidence for the  d – d interaction

showing a new absorption band at 500 nm. The interactions are weaker in aqueous solu-
tion and the color disappears. Similar stacked dimers can be obtained with Pd(acac) 2 ( 2b ) 
and Cu(acac) 2 ( 2c ). As a monomer, Cu(acac) 2 is a radical with one unpaired electron 
( S  =  ½ ). ESR spectroscopy reveals the presence of a triplet species ( S  =  1) and spin – spin 
interaction between the copper atoms in the complex ( 26c ) 2 @ 27 . Using a similar approach, 
higher deﬁ nite stacked towers can be synthesized consisting of seven or nine large aro-
matic molecules. 17 
 The spin state of a transition metal complex can even be changed by encapsulation. 
Spin crossover are usually induced by temperature or pressure changes, by light or by 
magnetic stimuli.  18   Using cage  23  as a host for the red, planar, low spin complex Ni(II)
(acen) ( S  =  0) a green 1  :  1 complex is obtained (Scheme  10.10 ). 19 SQUID measurements 
show that the ground state is then coupled with the high - spin state ( S  =  1) via a spin - orbit 
interaction. The spin crossover results from interactions between the   dz2 orbital of Ni(II) 
with the triazine ring of the panel forming a pseudo octahedral ligand ﬁ eld. 
 10.4  Inclusion of Reactive Intermediates 
 10.4.1  Viologen Radical Cations 
 Viologens (4,4 ′  - bipyridinium) are widely used because of their electron - transfer proper-
ties. However, application is often hindered by the poor stability of the corresponding 
cation radical. Inclusion in a macromolecule should largely prevent intermolecular reac-
tions or dimerization of this reactive species. Cucurbiturils, which easily can be synthe-
sized from glycoluril and formaldehyde, are perfect hosts for organic cations due to their 
rigidity and the combination of a hydrophobic cavity with a very polar rim of urea groups 
leading to high association constants. The main drawback is their poor solubility in water 
and in organic solvents.  20   Thus, the dication methyl viologen ( 28 ) is tightly bound by 
cucurbit[7]uril (k   =  1  ×  10 5  M  − 1  for  28 @CB[7]). 21   This value is signiﬁ cantly higher than 
those determined, for the previously studied complexes with the more ﬂ exible cyclodex-
trins (10 3 – 10 4  M  − 1 ). Upon inclusion,  28  indeed keeps its electrochemical properties and

still undergoes a reversible one - electron reduction to radical cation  28 * without changes 
in the kinetic. The reduced complex  28  * @CB[7] with the radical cation is still ﬁ rmly 
bonded because the guest is still charged. Further reduction leads to a neutral viologen 
which for the most part is released from the host.  22 
 This approach can also be applied for example to the protection of polyaniline (PANI), 
one of the most useful conducting polymer due to its stability and the simple control of 
the conductivity through doping/dedoping strategies with protons or oxidizing agents. 
Polyaniline is obtained by oxidation of aniline, mostly with ammonium persulfate. The 
reduced form is the colorless leucoemeraldine with phenyl rings connected by amine 
bonds (Scheme  10.12 A). In the fully oxidized violet pernigraniline state, the links consist 
of imine groups. The most interesting form is the half - oxidized emeraldine, a blue - green 
paramagnetic polyradical cation which possesses a high conductivity of 1000   S   cm  − 1 . This 
conjugated polymer is therefore very interesting for application in molecular electronics. 
However, interchain interactions, coiling and the chemical stability of the molecule are 
common problems. A widely used approach is the encapsulation of the chain to form an 
insulated molecular wire.  23   In the case of emeraldine, it has been shown that   β - cyclodextrin 
can be threaded into the polymer forming a molecular necklace, a pseudopolyrotaxane. 
In  N - methyl - 2 - pyrrolidone, complexation by   β - cyclodextrin forces the polyaniline chain 
to change its conformation from coil to rod because the close packing of host molecules 
with a narrow cavity strongly favors the linear all -  trans conﬁ guration of the chain, the

conﬁ guration required to realize high conductivity.  24   This process is disfavored by entropy 
and therefore, it is only observed at temperatures below 2  ° C. Moreover, this insulated 
emeraldine is protected from chemical oxidation by iodine. Similarly, polyaniline has 
been threaded into a   β - 1,3 - glucan 25   and also into a more rigid molecular nanotube 
(Scheme  10.12 B) consisting of   α  - CD macrocycles which have been crosslinked with 
epichlorhydrin using polyethylene glycol as a template.  26   This linearized molecular wire 
could be observed by atomic force microscopy. 27 
 The strength of this approach is best illustrated by the stabilization of the radical cation 
 31 * +  of the dimer of polyaniline  29 conﬁ ned as a rotaxane in the cavity of cucurbit[7]
uril, an assembly soluble in a wide range of polar organic solvents (Scheme  10.13 ). 28 
Whereas in water the neutral rotaxane  31 @CB[7] is rapidly oxidized by oxygen to form 
the blue radical cation  31 * + @CB[7] which is relatively persistent toward further oxida-
tion, the free dimer  31  requires ammonium persulfate oxidation yielding the benzoquinoid 
dication  31 2+ almost directly. As shown by square wave voltammetry, these ﬁ ndings can 
be explained by a thermodynamic stabilization of the radical cation  31 * +  in comparison 
to the neutral  31  as a consequence of the strong afﬁ nity of the cucurbiturils for cations 
(The ﬁ rst oxidation potential is lowered by 570  mV upon rotaxanation). The resistance 
against further oxidation is the result of a kinetic effect (The second oxidation potential 
remains practically unchanged). The rotaxane  31 @CB[7] is synthesized in good yields 
by reductive amination of the complexed and protonated aniline  29 @CB[7] with the 
aldehyde stoppers  30 .

 10.4.2  Radicals 
 The supramolecular chemistry of radicals has been widely investigated, especially with 
stable radicals like TEMPO or benzyl  t - butyl nitroxide. 29   This is because radicals 
can be observed by EPR spectroscopy, a method particularly suitable to obtain kinetic 
information about the association and dissociation processes in the time range between 
10  − 9  and 10  − 5  seconds, i.e., for complexes displaying fast exchange on the NMR 
time scale. 
 More reactive radicals have been generated by photochemical cleavage of esters and 
ketones in dendrimers. Under these conditions, the radical pair remains encapsulated in 
a cage and the two moieties can better recombine. Furthermore, their mobility is reduced. 
One of the most impressive results is obtained by the cleavage of 1 - naphthyl phenylacyl 
ester  32 (Scheme  10.14 ). 30   Whereas the photolysis in hexane solution leads to a mixture 
of seven products, the reaction in an aqueous solution of  G2  or  G3  poly(alkyl aryl ether) 
dendrimers of the second (respectively, the third) generation at pH 9 is highly selective. 
This increase in selectivity is mainly caused by the short life - time of the singlet radical 
pair  33  and  34  in the conﬁ ned environment of the dendritic pocket. In hexane, the high 
persistency of the radicals allows the dimethyl phenylacyl radical  34  to split off CO to 
form the stable tertiary radical  35 . The rate of this decarbonylation reaction has been 
determined to be 1.5  ×  10 8  s  − 1 . The high persistency of the radicals is also the reason why 
they have enough time to diffuse away in hexane and ﬁ nally recombine to the symmetrical 
diphenylbutane  41  and naphthol  40 . In the dendrimer, recombination occurs in less than 
6   ns. On this time scale, as a consequence of the high viscosity of the medium and the 
restricted mobility of the radical pair, the recombination remains highly selective and 
formation of the  ortho - ketone  36  is strongly preferred (93% in  G2  and 96% in  G3 ). The 
sole side product is the  para - isomer  37 , the other pathways are still not open. Moreover, 
during this short time period, the radicals do not leak from the hydrophobic dendritic 
cavity to the water bulk. Thus, no products result from hydrolysis. Especially this absence 
of hydrolysis products and the high selectivity of the reaction in the relatively open den-
drimer of the second generation are remarkable. Experiments based on the generation of 
long - lived triplet radical pairs which can only recombine if they undergo intersystem 
crossing have shown that the dendrimer cavities are leak - proof even on the microsecond 
time scale. Performing this photolysis in a SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) micelle leads 
to similar results but the reaction is less selective. Additional examples are described in 
the ﬁ rst chapter of this book. 
 The particular steric conditions prevailing in guest – host systems allow the observation 
of some unusual reactions which are rarely observed in solution (Scheme  10.15 ). This is 
the case for the photooxidation of adamantane  43  in the   Pd L
6
4
12+ cage  22b  which leads to 
the generation of an adamantyl radical in an anion radical ( 43 3 . 43 * @ 22b *  −  ). 31 This reac-
tion is caused by the narrow conﬁ nement of four adamantane molecules in  43 4 @ 22b 
which are pressed against the triazine core of the ligand (host – guest distance  =  2.6  Å ). 
This triazine being coordinated to three pyridines and being part of a cationic cage is a 
particularly efﬁ cient electron acceptor which can remove an electron from the guest. The 
freshly  in situ  generated adamantyl radical cation then loses a proton and selectively forms 
the tertiary 1 - adamantyl radical  43  *  because it is more stable than the 2 - adamantyl radical. 
Finally, reaction with water or oxygen leads to the formation of 1 - adamantanol  44 and

spectroscopy.  
 10.4.3  Carbenes 
 Carbenes are species comprising a divalent carbon atom. Because this carbon has only 
six valence electrons, it is highly electron - deﬁ cient and reactive.  32 However, depending 
on the groups attached to the carbenic carbon, the stability and the philicity of these 
species vary greatly.  33   For example, the  N  - heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) which have been 
recognized as powerful organocatalysts and ligands are nucleophilic and can even be 
isolated. However, they remain air and moisture - sensitive. These compounds illustrate 
why a supramolecular approach is useful in this ﬁ eld. It allows the broadening of the 
reaction conditions in which sensitive intermediates can be applied and manipulated. 
Classical approaches include complexation of the carbene with Lewis - acids like CO 2 or 
the highly electrophilic SiCl 4 . However, these compounds tend to be too stable. Good 
results are also obtained with the use of a polydimethylsiloxane matrix which compen-
sates the weaker acidity of the silicon atoms in silicone by its macromolecularity. The 
stabilization interaction is low (3 – 5  kcal  mol  − 1 ), preserving the reactivity but nevertheless 
allows for storing and handling in the presence of air. 34 
 Most of the work concerning the modiﬁ cation of carbene reactivity has been performed 
on cyclodextrins (CD) with reactive alkyl carbenes. Diazirines have proven to be the most 
convenient precursors due to the small size of the three - membered ring and the volatility 
of the leaving group, molecular nitrogen. Diazirines are usually obtained from the 
corresponding ketone in two steps: in a methanolic solution of ammonia, hydroxylamine -
 O  - sulfonic acid (HOSA) is added yielding a diaziridine which then is oxidized to the 
diazirine, most conveniently with iodine. 
 On a laboratory scale, the complexes are prepared by the coprecipitation method:  35 the 
guest is added to an aqueous solution of the hydrophilic cyclodextrin. The complex is 
usually less soluble, precipitates and can be isolated by ﬁ ltration or centrifugation. For 
water - insoluble guests, diethyl ether can be used to facilitate the phase transfer. The ether 
then can be blown away by bubbling argon through the solution. The main driving forces 
for the complex formation are hydrophobic and van - der - Waals interactions. These are the

reasons why the most important criteria for a high association constant are a good ﬁ t 
between the dimensions of the guest and the cavity of cyclodextrins and a high polarizabil-
ity of the guest molecules. In water, the driving force for complex formation is governed 
by the hydrophobicity of the inner surface of the cyclodextrins. Indeed, any water mol-
ecules residing inside the cavity are higher in energy because they cannot build an exten-
sive network of hydrogen bonds. They are then readily displaced by the hydrophobic 
guest in order to minimize the surface where water molecules are in contact with apolar 
units. 
 To understand the reactivity of a carbene entrapped inside a host molecule, the proper-
ties of the inclusion complex should be investigated ﬁ rst. This occurs by measurement of 
the changes in the physical properties of the guest upon complexation. Whereas spectro-
photometric and ﬂ uorescence spectroscopy are most useful for dyes and conductometric 
studies for ionic compounds, diazirines in cyclodextrins are best studied applying circular 
dichroism  36   and NMR spectroscopy. Indeed, circular dichroism which measures the dif-
ference in absorbance between left and right circularly polarized light is a very powerful 
method because only the complex gives rise to an absorption spectrum, an effect which 
is called induced circular dichroism (ICD). In fact, two conditions should be met to obtain 
a signal: ﬁ rst, a chromophore absorbing UV or visible light, a condition fulﬁ lled only by 
the diazirine and second, a center of chirality, e.g., as observed in cyclodextrins. Titration 
experiments allow the determination of the strength of the complex and the stoichiometry 
is obtained by the method of continuous variation. Moreover, information can be obtained 
about the orientation of the chromophore in relation to the cyclodextrin depending on the 
sign of the ICD effect (Figure  10.2 ). According to Harata ’ s rule 37   which is based on the 
Kirkwood – Tinoco 38   theory of polarizabilities, a positive sign of the ICD effect means that 
the transition dipole moment vector of the chromophore is parallel to the symmetry axis 
of the cyclodextrin, whereas a negative sign is caused by a perpendicular arrangement. 
Harata ’ s rule is valid for an aromatic chromophore located inside the cavity; in case where 
the chromophore is situated outside, the signs are reversed, according to Kodaka ’ s rule. 39 
 During the past twenty years, signiﬁ cant work has been performed. Several carbenes 
have been studied in order to observe changes in their reactivity. Especially the supra-

molecular chemistry of 4 - oxocyclohexa - 2,5 - dienylidene 40 , 2 - methylcyclohexylidene, 3 - 
nortricyclanylidene, cyclooctylidene, chlorophenylcarbene, and adamantanylidene was 
investigated. 41 
 10.4.3.1  4 - Oxocyclohexa - 2,5 - dienylidene 
 4 - Oxocyclohexa - 2,5 - dienylidene ( 48 ) is known as an intermediate in the degradation of 
4 - chlorophenol ( 46 ), a widespread organic pollutant. Carbene  48  is generated by photoin-
duced dehalogenation (  λ  =  280  nm) of  46 and is relatively long - lived ( ca. 1  µ s) in water 
because this triplet carbene is reluctant to abstract hydrogen from OH groups (Scheme 
 10.16 ). 40   Depending on the reaction conditions, carbene  48  can be trapped efﬁ ciently 
either by oxygen to form  p - benzoquinone ( 50 ) through the intermediacy of benzoquinone -
 O - oxide ( 49 ). It can also be scavenged as biphenyl  54  by reaction with the starting mate-
rial, or as hydroquinone ( 53 ) by reaction with water, or can be trapped by an alkene. In 
an aqueous cyclodextrin (CD) solution, however, the usual reaction pathway to benzo-
quinone  50  is hampered; instead, phenol ( 52 ) is obtained. In the presence of CDs, although 
the association constants are rather small (140   M  − 1  for   α - CD and 300  M  − 1  for   β - CD), 
carbene  48  becomes difﬁ cult to trap. Instead, hydrogen abstraction from the host strongly 
dominates to form phenol ( 52 ). This is especially true for   α - CD: a 0.03  M solution of 
 α  - CD (83% complexation) yields 91% of phenol even in the presence of air. Indeed, the 
rate constant for the quenching of triplet  48  by   α - CD ( k q  =  5.7  ×  10 8  M  − 1  s  − 1 ) is very high. 
This is not only due to the good hydrogen donor property of secondary alcohols but also 
to the conﬁ nement in the narrow cavity of   α  - CD as revealed by a comparison with the 
signiﬁ cantly slower hydrogen abstraction from alcohols or glucose ( k q  =  8.5  ×  10 6  M  − 1  s  − 1 ). 
In fact, the life - time of  48  is impressively reduced to a few tens of nanoseconds in the 
presence of cyclodextrin. Photolysis in the solid state also leads to phenol ( 52 ). 42

Molecular Encapsulation
 The selectivity of an intramolecular carbene reaction is very strongly dependent on the 
conformation of the molecule, due to the high reactivity of the divalent carbon and its 
poor selectivity. If a carbene precursor or the carbene entrapped within a cavity is forced 
to take on a different conformation than the one prevailing in the liquid state, new products 
can be expected. For molecules with functional groups, a change in the geometry can be 
enforced by using noncovalent interactions like hydrogen bonds, dipole – dipole, or ion –
 ion interactions. For alkanes only few strategies remain; a convex structure can be built 
up to press the alkyl groups into a speciﬁ c pocket 43   or the hydrophobic effect can be 
employed to compress apolar units into the cavity of a host (Figure  10.3 ).  44 These 
approaches have proven to be successful for the packing of alkyl chains into reduced 
space. Alkyl chains which are normally fully extended in solution (all  anti ) can be forced 
to coil to a helix in order to ﬁ t into the available restricted space. Use of polarizable side 
walls slightly helps the change in conformation by increasing van - der - Waals interactions 
and C − H/  π  interactions. An example is the coiling of the alkyl chain of the anionic sur-
factant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in the anionic cavitand  55  in water. The coiling is 
monitored best by NMR spectroscopy as the CH 2  protons are strongly shifted upﬁ eld 
when they are placed in proximity of an aromatic ring and by NOE measurements which 
allow determining the size of the helix in the most representative conformation. In the 
case of  SDS @ 55 , an eight - carbon helix seems to be present together with a few percent 
of a six - carbon helix. Of course, due to the ﬂ exibility of the alkyl chain and the fact that 
an optimally ﬁ lled cavity should have a packing coefﬁ cient of only 55%,  45 rapid changes 
in the conformation still occur. The energetic cost for the coiling process has been esti-
mated at circa 0.5   kcal ⋅ mol  − 1 for each  gauche interaction. 
 10.4.3.2  2 - Methylcyclohexylidene 
 One of the ﬁ rst attempts to follow this concept was performed with 2 - methylcyclohexy-
lidene ( 57 ). Carbene  57  is known to yield 1 - methylcyclohexene ( 59 ) and 3 - methylcy-

diazirine  56  as photoactivated precursor, a number of intermediates  †   are generated which 
can be trapped depending on the reaction conditions or decompose to alkenes  59  and  60 . 
In absence of a suitable reaction partner, carbene  57  is generated. The most characteristic 
reaction for its presence is the intramolecular insertion into CH bonds. It was hypothesized 
that the steric constraints in the cavity of a cyclodextrin may favor the conformer  57 ax 
with an axial methyl group over conformer  57 eq  which is the most stable conformer under 
normal conditions (Scheme  10.18 ).  47   As a consequence of the high reactivity of carbenes

and their propensity to react with a wide range of bonds that are suitably aligned, the 
presence of a different conformer of the reactive intermediate should lead to a different 
product distribution. For an efﬁ cient hydrogen shift, the ﬁ lled molecular orbital of the 
breaking CH bond (HOMO) should be aligned with the empty orbital at the carbenic 
center (LUMO). In  57 ax , the arrangement of the orbitals is much more favorable for a 
1,3 - CH insertion which would produce norcarane  58 . Moreover, formation of alkene  59 
should be hampered. Unfortunately, starting from diazirine  56 , no signiﬁ cant change is 
obtained;  58 is not formed and the alkene ratio does not signiﬁ cantly vary (Table  10.1 ). 
 The intermediates being electron - deﬁ cient, formation of alkene  59  is always favored 
in accordance with Saytzeff ’ s rule. The highest yield of  59  is obtained from the solid state 
photolysis of  56 @ α  - CD owing to a relative high  59  :  60  ratio and the absence of inter-
molecular products.  
 10.4.3.3  3 - Nortricyclanylidene 
 Similarly, 3 - nortricyclanylidene ( 66 ) was studied to obtain some evidence for an operat-
ing corset effect imposed by the macrocyclic host.  48   In the gas phase and also in solution, 
 66 ring - opens to 4 - ethynylcyclopentene ( 67 ) via cyclopropylcarbene fragmentation, a 
reaction which causes a signiﬁ cant change in the geometry of the guest (Scheme  10.19 ). 
It was expected that generating carbene  66  in the nanopore of a cyclodextrin would favor 
the formation of quadricyclane ( 69 ) through a 1,3 - CH insertion in analogy to the reactivity 
of 2 - norbornanylidene ( 73 ) affording  68  in a nearly quantitative yield.  49 However,  69 was 
never observed from any reaction of the cyclodextrin complexes. Instead and in contrast 
to the results obtained with methylcyclohexylidene  57 , a very signiﬁ cant amount of the 
carbene  66  reacted with the OH groups at the rims of cyclodextrins ( 71 : 52% with   β - CD 
and 80% with  α - CD, Table  10.2 ). This ﬁ nding can be explained by the difference in the 
life - time of carbenes  57  and  66 , respectively. Whereas  57  can rearrange very easily to an 
alkene by a 1,2 - H - shift, this pathway does not exist for  66 . As an alternative, the cleavage 
of the three - membered ring requires to overcome a considerable energy barrier. This 
leaves more time for the guest to react innermolecularly with the host. An intriguing result 
is the formation of the signiﬁ cant amount (14%) of nortricyclane ( 68 ) in the narrow and 
rigid cavity of  α - CD. Product  68  is caused by a twofold abstraction of hydrogen. However, 
insertion of the carbene into a CH bond of the host does not occur, a reaction that up to 
now has never been observed with cyclodextrins. Formation of azine  70  in   β - CD suggests 
that  65 @ β  - CD crystallizes in a head - to - head arrangement with two diazirine groups 
facing each other.

 10.4.3.4  Adamantanylidene 
 Photolyses of the   α - ,   β - , and   γ - cyclodextrin complexes  74 @CD of 2 - aziadamantane ( 74 ) 
in the solid state indeed afforded markedly different product distributions and also dif-
ferent inclusion geometries (Figure  10.4 ).  51,52 The complexes  74 @CD have been investi-
gated in detail using ICD.  53   This study performed in aqueous solutions shows that whereas 
the diazirine group in  74 @ β - CD and  60 @ γ - CD is placed in the vicinity of polar OH 
groups, the diazirine function in  74 @(  α - CD) 2 is located in an apolar microenvironment 
as is revealed by the ﬁ ne structure of its CD and UV spectrum. Moreover, for  74 @(  α -
 CD) 2 , a very large ICD (  ∆ ε  ∞   =  − 0.732  M  − 1  cm  − 1  at 380   nm) is obtained due to strong 
interaction of the guest with the chiral cyclodextrin. This is in contrast to the weak absorp-
tion measured for  74 @ γ  - CDs which can be explained by the increased mobility of the 
guest  74 in the large and more ﬂ exible cavity of   γ - CD. 52 The validity of computational 
calculations of host – guest complexes has been questioned. 54 Titration experiments have 
revealed the thermodynamic parameters of the 2 - aziadamantane   β - CD complex; it has 
also been shown that the results obtained are in good agreement with molecular dynamics 
simulations of this complex under explicit consideration of water molecules.  55 These dif-
ferences in the strength of the complex are found again chemically: the reactivities of the 
enclosed adamantanylidene diverge signiﬁ cantly (Scheme  10.20 and Table  10.3 ). 51,52 
 Especially the 1   :   2 complex formed with   α  - cyclodextrin leads to a drastic modiﬁ cation 
of the product distribution. Due to a complete encapsulation of the guest, formation of 
azine  78  is totally inhibited, thus inner -  and intramolecular reaction pathways are favored.

However, within the conﬁ ned environment, the 1,3 C − H insertion reaction of carbene  75 
is not favored; the yield of didehydroadamantane ( 76 ) remains low (9%) and CH - insertions 
into the host do not occur as well. Instead, the production of adamantane ( 77 ) is strongly 
enhanced and reaches 31%. The formation of  77  is particularly facilitated by the fact that

 75  has been generated as a singlet and generally reacts as a singlet, the speciﬁ c steric 
constraints prevailing in the rigid cavity of two   α  - CDs hamper concerted insertion reac-
tions which have high requirements on the alignment of the orbitals involved in the reac-
tion. Instead, intersystem crossing and hydrogen abstraction are favored. Accordingly, 
oxidized  α  - CD is also recovered. This pathway is more signiﬁ cant for adamantanylidene 
 75  than for nortricyclanylidene  66  because  66  has a larger singlet - triplet gap due to a 
higher ring strain. In fact, the main reaction of  75 corresponds to an etheriﬁ cation of the 
secondary rim of the cyclodextrin (39% for  81 - 3 ′  and 19% for  81 - 2 ′ ). The predilection 
for reaction at position 3 corresponds to the geometrical requirement of the most stable 
conformation of the alkylated cyclodextrins  81 . In  81 - 3 ′ , the adamantyl group preferably 
remains directly on the top of the cavity, whereas in  81 – 2 ′ , it points outwards. Reaction 
with the primary hydroxy group at C6 does not occur. The photolyses of the 1   :   1 com-
plexes with   β - and   γ  - CD afford a wider range of products.  52   First of all, with   β - and   γ - CD, 
etheriﬁ cation at C6 is geometrically possible and does happen. With  74 @ β - CD, even two 
adamantyl groups can react with the hydroxy functions of the same cyclodextrin molecule. 
Second, the main product is azine  78  along with adamantanone ( 79 ) which probably arises 
from the hydrolysis of an intermediate on the way to azine  78  or directly from  78 . 52 And 
ﬁ nally, it is worth noticing that the yield of adamantanol  80  very strongly depends on the 
dryness of the hygroscopic cyclodextrin complexes. Overall, the ICD spectra and the 
products obtained from photolysis of 2 - aziadamantane ( 74 ) in CD allow to draw conclu-
sions about the supramolecular structure. Indeed, the results are mostly compatible with 
a head - to - head arrangement of the cyclodextrins in the  74 @(  α - CD) 2  complex (Figure 
 10.4 ). For the  β  - CD complex, the major product being azine  78 , a 2  :  2 structure is more 
likely (Figure  10.4 ). Such a combination of CDs would be the analogue of the structure 
determined by X - ray analysis for the complex of 5 - hydroxy - 2 - aziadamantane with   β - CD 50 
(Figure  10.5 ).

 10.4.3.5  Arylcarbenes 
 The following example emphasizes the fact that to observe drastic changes in the reactiv-
ity, encapsulation in a host molecule is not compulsory. It is often sufﬁ cient to perform 
the reaction in a constrained system under the condition that the adequate conformation 
is present. Thus, striking results have been obtained starting from 1 - (1,1 ′ - biphenyl - 4 - yl) -
 1 - diazo - 2 - phenylpropane ( 82 ). Although photolysis of  82  in solution yields a complex 
mixture of products resulting from hydrogen and phenyl shifts, photolysis in the solid 
state is highly stereoselective and affords almost exclusively the ( Z ) - alkene  84 (Scheme 
 10.21 ) as a consequence of the conformational constraints of the crystal packing which 
are nearly the same in the reactant and in the ( Z ) - product. 57   Moreover, the migrating 
hydrogen is already perfectly aligned with the empty p orbital of the carbene intermediate 
 83 and no rotation is required for the 1,2 hydrogen shift. 
 10.4.3.6  Chloro(phenyl)carbene 
 Attempts were also made to observe the rearrangement of chloro(phenyl)carbene ( 86 ) to 
1 - chloro - 1,2,4,6 - cycloheptatetraene ( 87 ) in the cavity of cyclodextrins.  58 Starting from 
diazirine  85 , the rearrangement to  87  can indeed be observed in an argon matrix at 10   K.  59 
Under preparative conditions, 100% of azine  88  is obtained. What would happen in a 
molecular capsule? Reactive intermediate  86  belongs to the category of carbenes that are 
particularly suitable for intermolecular reactions as a result of the absence of a reaction 
pathway like the common hydrogen shifts leading to the formation of alkenes. As a con-
sequence, carbene  86 possesses a relatively long life - time (3.6  µ s in isooctane) 60 and 
prefers to react with the OH groups of CDs yielding almost exclusively benzaldehyde 
( 89 ) (Scheme  10.22 ). 58

 This high propensity of entrapped carbenes to react with native   α - and   β - cyclodextrin 
motivated us to search for more inert hosts. Therefore, after a few experiments with 
hydrophilic cyclodextrins derivatives, i.e., permethylated cyclodextrins (TRIMEB in the 
case of  β - CD, TRIMEA for  α - CD) were performed successfully as molecular reactors 
for supramolecular carbene chemistry.  61   This is due to their ready availability,  62 their high 
solubility in water and in organic solvents and their good crystallization properties. The 
absence of OH groups at the rims of TRIMEB makes this host inert toward reactions of 
carbenes. However, owing to the lack of intramolecular hydrogen bridges, TRIMEB is 
more ﬂ exible and forms less stable complexes with lower association constants in com-
parison to native   β - cyclodextrin. 61 
 10.4.3.7  Bicyclo[3.2.1]octan - 8 - ylidenes 
 The most recent experiments have been performed with 3 - substituted bicyclo[3.2.1]octan -
 8 - ylidenes  91 . These carbenes were chosen because of their symmetry. In the presence 
of a chiral host these achiral intermediates could give rise to chiral products  92  and  93 
(Scheme  10.23 ). The aim of this study was to determine whether the intrinsically chiral 
cyclodextrin hosts are able to cause the formation of one enantiomer over the other.  63 The 
unsubstituted bicyclo[3.2.1]octan - 8 - ylidene ( 91 ) reacts exclusively through 1,3 - CH inser-
tion to tricyclooctane  92 . 64 For the 3 - endo - substituted carbenes  91 , a second reaction 
pathway becomes competitive yielding bicyclo[3.3.0]octene  93  by a 1,2 alkyl shift. It was 
found that not only the host is able to induce a modest enantiomeric excess but the corset 
effect of the host can also signiﬁ cantly alter the bicyclooctene :tricyclooctane ratio  93  :  92 
(Table  10.4 ). Once again, the rigid and narrow bowl of   α  - CD exerts the strongest inﬂ u-
ence on the guest.  90b @(  α - CD) 2  is the complex for which the highest ee (8%) is obtained. 
Also the formation of  93 is preferred over  92 . 63 
 For  90b @TRIMEB, a single crystal suitable for X - ray analysis could be grown (Figure 
 10.6 ). 61   The structure obtained ascertains the complete separation of one guest molecule 
from another and explains why azine  94  is lacking in the product mixture resulting from 
the photolysis of  90b @TRIMEB.  90b @TRIMEB is a good example for a complex for

which the orientation of the guest depends on its environment. In the solid state, the 
hydroxy group of the guest is positioned in the middle of the cyclodextrin cavity forming 
a hydrogen bridge with a glucosidic oxygen atom. In contrast, in an aqueous solution, the 
orientation is reversed: the hydroxy group is pointing toward the larger rim and the bulk 
of the solvent whereas the diazirine unit is deeply enclosed within the hydrophobic cavity

as demonstrated from ICD spectra and 2D ROESY experiments. The association constant 
determined by the curve ﬁ tting method is 550  M  − 1  in water; this is still a fair value but 
already considerably less then the association constant of the corresponding  90b @ β - CD

 10.4.4  Nitrenes 
 Our knowledge about supramolecular nitrene chemistry and the reactivity of these inter-
mediates in a constrained system is still in its infancy: even though nitrenes are widely 
used for photoafﬁ nity labelling. 65   However, the exact structures of the products formed 
after reaction with the active sites are often unknown. Therefore, a better understanding 
of the binding properties of a nitrene precursor within the host molecule is necessary. 
Moreover, it is essential to learn which reactions still do occur inside a supramolecular 
structure. 
 Azides  96  are the most popular precursors for nitrenes  97 , which can be generated 
either thermally or photochemically.  66   In a nitrene, the nitrogen atom is monovalent and 
possesses a sextet of electrons in its outer shell. Therefore, nitrenes are highly reactive 
intermediates. Usually, they are generated as singlets with paired electrons. However, 
intersystem crossing to the diradical triplet ground state is quite fast. (Scheme  10.24 ) 
 The most characteristic reaction of nitrenes consists of secondary amine  98 formation 
by insertion into C − H bonds either in a concerted process for singlets or through hydrogen 
abstraction followed by recombination of the radical couple for triplets, a process called 
pseudoinsertion. An even more efﬁ cient reaction is the addition to alkenes to form aziri-
dines. For singlets, this addition is concerted and thus stereoselective. Whereas for triplets, 
the reaction proceeds through a stepwise mechanism involving radicals and therefore is 
not stereoselective. Further typical reactions are double hydrogen abstraction of triplet 
nitrenes to afford primary amines  100 and formation of azo compound  99 by reaction 
with the azide precursor or by dimerization when the nitrene concentration is high. 
 Our group has investigated the behavior of nitrenes enclosed in host molecules. 
For this purpose, we have obtained initial results with adamantyl nitrenes which can be 
generated either thermally or photochemically from readily available adamantane azides.  67

Two main reasons guided this choice. On one hand, the reactions of these compounds 
under classical conditions are already known. This facilitates to ﬁ nd out, how nitrene 
reactivity has been modiﬁ ed by inclusion. On the other hand, as has been shown earlier 
in this chapter, the adamantane skeleton is a good ﬁ t for the cavity of   α - and   β - cyclodextrins 
leading to high association constants upon complexation. 
 10.4.4.1  1 - Adamantanyl nitrene 
 1 - Adamantanyl nitrene ( 102 ) is generated by photolysis of 1 - adamantane azide ( 101 ). 
Nitrene  102  rearranges by an alkyl shift to the unstable imine  103 (Scheme  10.25 ). The 
C = N double bond is quite reactive because it is located at a bridge - head. Therefore,  103 
dimerizes to azetidine  105  in a head - to - tail fashion in an alkane solution or in the solid 
state. 68 
 In   α  -  and also in   β  - cyclodextrin, the outcome of the reaction is totally different because 
dimerization to  105  cannot occur. Instead, during the aqueous work - up the hemiaminal 
4 - azahomoadamantan - 3 - ol ( 104 ) is formed by addition of water to the bridge - head imine 
(Table  10.5 ). 
 10.4.4.2  2 - Adamantanyl nitrene 
 2 - Adamantane azide ( 106 ) behaves similarly (Scheme  10.26 ): after generation of nitrene 
 107 , the main reaction consists of a 1,2 - alkyl shift to form 4 - azahomoadamant - 4 - ene ( 108 ) 
which can be isolated.  69   As a side product, adamantane imine ( 109 ) is produced through

a 1,2 - H shift in  107 . Compound  109  easily hydrolyzes to afford adamantanone ( 79 ). When 
nitrene  107 is generated inside the cyclodextrin cavity, very similar results are obtained 
(Table  10.6 ). In any case, both adamantanyl nitrenes did not form any isolable innermo-
lecular products with   α - or  β - cyclodextrin. 
 10.4.4.3  Ferrocenyl nitrene 
 The third case study concerns ferrocenyl nitrene. The geometry of the inclusion com-
plexes of its precursor inside   α - and   β - cyclodextrins was thoroughly investigated using 
induced circular dichroism, quantum mechanical and NMR studies.  70   Because of the poor 
solubility of these complexes in water, alternative solvents had to be employed. Aprotic 
polar solvents like DMSO and DMF possess the best solubilizing properties but at the 
cost of low association constants. Ethylene glycol is a better compromise between binding 
and solubilizing properties. 
 Indeed, the behavior of ferrocenyl azide inside   β  - cyclodextrin is striking, since the 
alignment of the guest changes depending on the solvent and the temperature (Figure 
 10.7 ). In ethylene glycol and in DMSO/H 2 O 50/50, a negative ICD is obtained which 
results from an axial orientation according to Harata ’ s rule (Figure  10.8 , Structure A). 
With DMSO contents higher than 62%, the ICD band is positive, ferrocenyl azide adopts 
an equatorial arrangement (Structure B). Structure B is also favored at higher temperatures 
as can be shown by the sign reversal of the ICD spectra between 10 and 40    ° C (Figure 
 10.7 B). The proposed geometries of inclusion are also corroborated by 2D ROESY spec-
troscopy (Table  10.7 ).

 Finally, the ferrocenyl complexes were decomposed photochemically and thermally. 
Thermolyses can be performed in this case because the decomposition temperature of 
the azide ( 96 ) (80  ° C) is much lower than those employed for other diazirines and azides. 
The results obtained from photolyses and thermolyses do not differ signiﬁ cantly. Here 
again,  α  - CD causes the most drastic changes because of the complete encapsulation of 
the guest in a 1   :   2 complex (Scheme  10.27 ). In accord with the other reactions performed 
in  α  - CD, the main reaction pathway is hydrogen abstraction from the host. Upon ther-
molysis ferrocenyl amine ( 112 ) is obtained in a yield up to 60%. More remarkably, 
ferrocenyl nitrene ( 111 ) seems to react in very low yields with   α - CD. However, the 
structure of the reaction product  113  has not been fully established yet and is quite 
unexpected because  113  is the result of a glucopyranose - furanose conversion. In contrast,

(Figure  10.9 , orientation A) whereas in the other half this group is pointing toward the 
secondary rim (orientation B).  67 
 10.4.4.4  Phenylnitrene 
 Phenylnitrene ( 117 ) can be generated as a singlet from phenyl azide ( 116 ) under UV 
irradiation. Below 165   K, intersystem crossing to the triplet state occurs. Otherwise, an 
alkyl shift leads to the formation of the easily polymerizing 1 - azacyclohepta - 1,2,4,6 -
 tetraene ( 118 ), (Scheme  10.28 ) a compound which is in equilibrium with singlet phenyl-
nitrene. 71   Finally, the nitrene may be trapped if suitable compounds are present, e.g. 
formation of azobenzene ( 119 ) by reaction with phenyl azide. Otherwise, hydrogen 
abstraction affords aniline ( 120 ) and polymerization products are often obtained.  72 
Interestingly, the chemical behavior of phenylnitrene is strongly altered when this inter-
mediate is generated inside the resorcin[4]arene - based cavitand  121 . 72 Especially,  121 can 
be functionalized regioselectively depending on the structure of the complex. 
 The complex  116 @ 121  is obtained in a 1.5   :   1 stoichiometry by crystallization from a 
saturated solution of cavitand  121  in phenyl azide ( 116 ) and drying at 25    ° C (18  h at 
0.4   Torr). Irradiation of the 1.5   :   1 complex of  116 @ 121  leads to the formation of  N -
 alkylaniline  122 as the major product (35%) through a regioselective C − H insertion of 
phenylnitrene into one of the alkyl chains (Scheme  10.29 ). The formation of product  122 
is a strong hint that in  116 @ 121  excess of phenyl azide is located between the alkyl 
chains. The major secondary product is azobenzene ( 119 ) (22%). This relatively high 
yield of dimerization product can be explained by the speciﬁ c packing found in the crystal 
structure of  116 @ 121 , namely a head - to - head arrangement in which two azido groups 
are in close proximity. 
 DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) analysis reveals how a 1   :   1 complex can be 
obtained (Figure  10.10 ). Indeed, two dissociation processes are observed. First, excess 
phenyl azide is lost between 70 and 125    ° C (  ∆ H  =  4.0  kcal  mol  − 1 ). Second, the remaining 
1  :  1 complex dissociates at 142  ° C with a fairly high   ∆ H of 13.1  kcal  mol  − 1 . It is worth 
noticing that MPWB1K/6 - 31+G(d,p) calculations (  ∆ H  =  11.1  kcal  mol  − 1 ) are in good 
agreement with the experimental results concerning the orientation of the guest and the 
strength of the interactions.

and yields the two diastereomeric aziridines  123  (31%) and  124  (7%) together with 
azobenzene ( 119 ) (11%). This high regioselectivity and even the aziridine formation can 
only be obtained using solid state photolysis and are the result of the restricted motion of 
the nitrene in the cavitand. Indeed, photolysis of phenyl azide in presence of 10 equiv of 
quinoxaline in benzene affords only aniline ( 120 ) (17%) and azobenzene ( 119 ) (9%). The 
azanorcaradienes  123  and/or  124  can be converted into azepine  126  upon heating via a 
1,5 - sigmatropic nitrogen migration to aziridine  125  followed by valence isomerization 
(Scheme  10.30 ). Irradiation of azepine  126  affords back the aziridines  123  and  124  in a 
ratio of 1  :  5; this reaction chain allows reversing the ratio of  123  :  124 . 
 In conclusion, the generation of reactive intermediates in the cavity of a supramolecular 
structure offers a straightforward approach to the preparation of functionalized hosts as 
can be seen for example from the results obtained from the different regioselective modi-
ﬁ cations of a resorcin[4]arene cavitand by phenylnitrene.  72 The properties of the guest 
can be signiﬁ cantly changed: intersystem - crossing can be enforced and therefore a carbene 
can be coerced to react as a triplet. Accordingly, the reactivity may vary greatly. Moreover,

Molecular Encapsulation
as a trend, the encapsulated intermediates tend to be less reactive, especially in intermo-
lecular reactions and toward the inner side of the host. This is partly due to the steric 
requirement for the reaction and also due to the need to have an optimal alignment of the 
orbitals of the reactant. As a consequence of the conﬁ nement in a constrained system, 
these reactions are slowed down. However, especially in rigidly and densely packed 
complexes, some reactions which do not have strong requirements on the geometry of 
the transition state are strongly accelerated, e.g., electron transfer or hydrogen abstraction. 
Indeed, the narrow cavity of   α  - CD has proven to be a very efﬁ cient hydrogen donor 
toward triplet intermediates and radicals favoring the reduction of the guest.

 11.1  Introduction 
 Organic dyes have been used throughout the ages as pigments in everyday items like 
paints, clothing, and printed matter. More recently, ﬂ uorescent dyes have emerged as 
crucial components in many high technology devices such as secure banknotes, lasing 
media, optical data storage, biomedical probes, and environmental sensors. A critical issue 
in all of these applications is dye performance, which can be judged by several parameters 
such as chemical stability, photochemical stability, colour intensity, ﬂ uorescence quantum 
yield, solubility, toxicity, etc. The systematic development of organic dyes has been 
pursued since the ﬁ rst reported synthesis of Indigo by von Baeyer in 1882,  1 an accom-
plishment which set in motion the German chemical industry.  2 In recent times, interest 
in ﬂ uorescent dyes has increased dramatically due to their growing impact in biotechnol-
ogy and nanotechnology. It is worth noting that ﬂ uorescent dyes were a central component 
in the large scale sequencing methods that mapped the human genome, one of mankind ’ s 
most impressive scientiﬁ c achievements. 3 
 The most obvious way to alter dye performance is to synthetically modify the covalent 
structure. However, despite the continued advances in synthetic organic chemistry, the 
process of dye synthesis is still a tedious task that consumes materials and human 
resources. As a way of circumventing this problem, supramolecular chemists have started

to explore non - covalent methods for altering dye properties. The focus of this chapter is 
on mechanical encapsulation of dyes inside: (a) protective organic container molecules 
such as cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, cyclophanes, and crown ethers (Scheme  11.1 ), (b) 
biological receptors such as antibodies, aptamers and peptides, and (c) inorganic cages 
such as zeolites and silica nanoparticles. In some cases the dye binding process is revers-
ible and produces a host – guest complex that is in equilibrium with the free species; in 
other cases the mechanical bonding is so strong that the host – guest complex can be con-
sidered a permanent molecule. Upon encapsulation, the microenvironment around the dye 
is changed, which often alters the absorption wavelength or the ﬂ uorescence quantum 
yield. Further, the dye is sterically protected, thus inhibiting intermolecular processes that 
often degrade dye performance like self - aggregation which reduces brightness and colour 
purity and photooxidation which leads to bleaching. Steric protection of long wavelength 
dyes is expected to be particularly helpful, because these dyes inherently have narrow 
HOMO – LUMO gaps and thus tend to be highly reactive.

 There are various practical reasons to develop supramolecular methods of dye encap-
sulation. Reversible dye binding systems can be incorporated into dynamic association 
schemes that produce changes in colour or ﬂ uorescence emission. Thus, they can act as 
analytical sensing processes for environmental assays or as molecular probes for cell 
biology. Permanent encapsulation inside a container molecule can be achieved by several 
rotaxane synthesis methods that have been developed over the last twenty years.  4 These 
dye rotaxanes can act as bright and highly stable ﬂ uorescent probes for diagnostics and 
bioimaging applications. Another way to make a bioimaging agent is to use a genetically 
expressible bioreceptor such as an antibody or aptamer with a recognition motif that 
selectively binds a dye with high afﬁ nity. 5   These tagged bioreceptors can be visualized 
by ﬂ uorescence microscopy and used as imaging agents in cell biology research. Finally, 
permanent encapsulation of dyes inside porous inorganic matrices produces probes 
and advanced materials with many potential applications in biotechnology and 
nanotechnology. 6 
 11.2  Reversible Dye Encapsulation Inside Organic Container Molecules 
 Organic container molecules are large macrocycles whose internal cavities can accom-
modate guest molecules. Historically, the most studied family of water - soluble container 
molecules are the cyclodextrins (CDs) which have non - polar cavities that can accom-
modate organic dyes of appropriate size and insulate them from an aqueous solvent. The 
three most common CDs are  α - CD,   β - CD and   γ  - CD with cavity diameters of 5.7, 7.8 and 
9.5  Å respectively. 7 Encapsulation of ﬂ uorescent dyes inside a CD typically improves 
chemical and photochemical stability and also raises the ﬂ uorescence quantum yield. 
However, a drawback with CD encapsulation is the relatively weak association constant 
( K a  ∼  10 3 − 10 4  M  − 1 ) which can be readily disrupted. This has prompted a move in recent 
years to the cucurbit[n]uril (CB) family of container molecules which have much higher 
dye afﬁ nities in water and, like CDs, possess different diameters depending upon the 
number of repeating subunits in the macrocycle.  8   For example, the association constant 
for the dye Rhodamine in water is 50,000   M  − 1  with cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) but only 
210  M  − 1  with   β - CD. 9   The Rhodamine inclusion complex, in addition to possessing greater 
chemical stability and reduced dye aggregation, also exhibits properties distinct from 
uncomplexed Rhodamine dyes including longer ﬂ uorescence lifetimes and decreased 
nonspeciﬁ c adsorption to surfaces.  10   The inclusion complex appears quite suitable for dye 
based lasers, which operate most efﬁ ciently with aqueous lasing media. An aqueous solu-
tion of Rhodamine 6G complexed inside CB[7] produces better beam shape proﬁ les when 
compared to free Rhodamine 6G in ethanol. CB[7] can also be used in stoichiometric 
ratios and thus it negligibly impacts the refractive qualities of the water, unlike detergents 
and emulsiﬁ ers, which also produce a dye deaggregating effect, but adversely affects 
performance due to bubble and foam formation.  11 
 Related studies have shown that CB[7] binds fused tricyclic dyes such as Proﬂ avine, 
Pyronine Y, and Thionine with higher association constants than the analogous CD, and 
that dye encapsulation increases the ﬂ uorescence quantum yield.  12   In contrast to CB[7], 
the larger CB[8] encapsulates two dye molecules while the smaller CB[5] does not 
effectively encapsulate any tricyclic dye. In Figure  11.1 , the perceived colour of the dye

solution is altered by these encapsulation processes. This colour difference is attributed 
to changes in polarity induced by encapsulation and, when CB[8] is used, changes in 
dye aggregation. Separate studies have shown that CB[7] can also encapsulate Brilliant 
Green, a ﬂ uorescent antimicrobial trimethane dye, and form a 1   :   1 association complex 
with a binding constant of 17,000   M  − 1 . Intriguingly, the ﬂ uorescence quantum yield for 
the inclusion complex is further enhanced when it associates with bovine serum albumin 
(Figure  11.2 ). 13 
 Reversible dye binding systems can be developed into colourimetric and ﬂ uorescent 
assays for analytical detection. As shown in Figure  11.3 , two different binding schemes 
can be envisioned, (a) competitive dye/analyte inclusion, and (b) cooperative dye/analyte 
inclusion. The competitive inclusion process is the basis for the  ‘ dye displacement assay ’ 
where the analyte displaces the dye from the container molecule. For this process to be 
visualized, the properties of complexed and uncomplexed dyes must be markedly dif-

ferent. For example, CB[7] and the ﬂ uorescent dye Dapoxyl have been incorporated into 
an assay that monitors the activity of amino acid decarboxylase enzymes. 14 At pH 6, 
Dapoxyl has a relatively high afﬁ nity for CB[7] ( K a  =  20,000  M  − 1 ) and it is over 200 
times more ﬂ uorescent when inside the CB[7] cavity. Zwitterionic amino acids have 
much lower binding afﬁ nities for CB[7] ( K a  <  1,000  M  − 1 ) and cannot displace the dye, 
but the presence of amino acid decarboxylase leads to decarboxylated cationic products 
that have substantially stronger afﬁ nities for CB[7] ( ∼ 30,000  M  − 1 ). The overall scheme 
is a  ‘ switch off ’  assay, where the product of enzyme action displaces the dye from the 
container molecule which decreases the ﬂ uorescence intensity. In general,  ‘ switch on ’ 
ﬂ uorescence assays are technically easier to monitor but they are harder to devise because 
most dyes are more ﬂ uorescent when they are encapsulated. A rare example uses the 
dye 2,3 - diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct - 2 - ene (DBO), which is less ﬂ uorescent when it is bound 
to a  p - sulfonatocalix[4]arene macrocycle. 14   The action of amino acid decarboxylase leads 
to displacement of the DBO dye from the macrocycle and an eight - fold increase in ﬂ uo-
rescence intensity. 
 The other binding scheme in Figure  11.3  is cooperative dye/analyte inclusion, where 
the analyte promotes association of the dye inside the container molecule. Compared to 
dye displacement, this is a more complicated supramolecular system because it requires 
the container molecule to have multi - guest recognition properties. Proof - of - concept 
studies have been reported using crown ether cyclophanes as container molecules that 
can simultaneously bind two types of guests: ﬂ at aromatic dyes and metal cations. In 
Figure  11.4  is a crown ether derived naphthalene macrocycle whose weak afﬁ nity for a 
pyromellitic diimide is increased by an order of magnitude by the presence of lithium 
salts. 15   The crown ether oxygens coordinate to the lithium cations which in turn promotes 
simultaneous dye inclusion. The result is a stunning colour change from a pale yellow 
to bright red due to formation of a charge transfer complex. In principle, this multi - 
component assembly can be employed as a colorimetric sensor for lithium cations. 
 A related cooperative binding system is shown in Figure  11.5 . A crown ether derived 
macrocycle only binds a squaraine dye when sodium cations are present in the solution.  16 
The sodium cations bridge the dye and the crown ether oxygens inside the macrocyclic

cavity, an inclusion process that enhances the dye ’ s ﬂ uorescence. Addition of potassium 
cations leads to displacement of the sodium and consequent dye ejection from the cavity 
because the larger potassium ions bind to the cyclophane exterior and thus dye inclusion 
is no longer favoured. This multicomponent assembly system exhibits rudimentary char-
acteristics of a combination NOT/AND logic device where the presence of sodium alone 
causes ﬂ uorescence signal increase, but a mixture of sodium and excess potassium or 
potassium alone produces no change in ﬂ uorescence. 
 11.3  Reversible Dye Encapsulation by Biological Receptors 
 There is growing interest in biological receptors for ﬂ uorescent dyes, in particular, geneti-
cally expressed receptors such as proteins or oligonucleotides.  17   A major goal of this 
research is to discover high afﬁ nity dye recognition motifs that can be utilized for bio-
imaging applications. The recognition motif can be encoded into the sequence of a larger 
protein or oligonucleotide of interest where the dye can be used to non - covalently label 
the genetically expressed target in a living cell or animal. The initial challenge is to ﬁ nd 
the appropriate dye recognition motifs using standard biotechnology screening methods 
such as phage display, 18 yeast display, 19   or SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by 
exponential enrichment).  20   A recent example employed phage display technology to 
identify a 7 - mer peptide sequence (IQSPHFF) with subnanomolar afﬁ nity for a ﬂ uores-
cent near - IR benzindolium dye (Dye A in Figure  11.6 ).  21   Molecular modelling indicates 
that the peptide sequence forms a tweezer structure with two aromatic arms surrounding 
the ﬂ at dye. Incorporating the IQSPHFF sequence into larger protein structures allows

selective dye labelling in a range of assays including ELISA, ﬂ ow cytometry, high 
throughput screens, microscopy and  in vivo  imaging. However, a drawback with this 
protein labelling system is the small change in the dye emission wavelength and intensity 
that occurs upon binding which makes it difﬁ cult to distinguish between bound and 
unbound dye. This means there may be an undesirably high background signal which 
would lower the contrast. This problem can be minimized by using a dye whose ﬂ uores-
cence in free solution is weak but increases substantially upon association with the 
bioreceptor. Several antibodies have been identiﬁ ed that exhibit this ﬂ uorescence activat-
ing phenomenon. One example binds a stilbene derivative (dye B in Figure  11.6 ) produc-
ing a blue - emitting exciplex band due to interaction of the excited state stilbene with a 
ground - state tryptophan residue buried in the antibody.  22 Another research programme 
has used yeast display technology to identify single chain antibodies as ﬂ uorescence 
activating proteins.  23   The antibodies selectively bind target dyes such as dye C and 
increase the emission intensity by factors of several thousand. There has also been 
progress ﬁ nding RNA and DNA aptamers that bind dyes and raise quantum yields.  24 For 
example, a double - stranded RNA aptamer binds the cyanine dye D with  K a  =  10 7  M  − 1 and 
enhances the ﬂ uorescence quantum yield by 60 - fold. 25 
 11.4  Permanent Dye Encapsulation Inside Rotaxanes

Molecular Encapsulation
is to form an interlocked structure known as a rotaxane. Rotaxane synthesis has improved 
greatly over the last few decades with the discovery and reﬁ nement of a number of tem-
plated reactions. The three most common methods for rotaxane formation are clipping, 
capping, and slipping (Figure  11.7 ), and each has its strengths and weaknesses. To date, 
much of the research effort on dye rotaxanes has focused on developing synthetic methods 
that are compatible with the reactive functional groups in organic dyes. Yields for the 
rotaxane formation step are often low (5 – 30%) and eventually they will have to be raised 
if dye rotaxanes are to be implemented in commercial applications. A promising approach 
that warrants further attention is to use solid - state synthesis methods (Figure  11.7 ). 26 
 The pioneering dye rotaxane synthesis, reported by Anderson and coworkers in 1996, 
utilized Glaser coupling under aqueous conditions in the presence of a water soluble 
cyclophane macrocycle to produce a mixture of [2] and [3]rotaxanes with a conjugated 
phenylacetylene ﬂ uorophore as the axle component (Figure  11.8 ).  27   The purpose of the 
encapsulation was to insulate the conjugated   π  - system from quenching processes and both 
rotaxanes were found to be six fold more ﬂ uorescent. 
 Many of the subsequent preparations of dye rotaxanes have employed CD as the pro-
tective macrocycle. In each case, a threaded complex is assembled in aqueous solution 
and a covalent capping reaction produces the permanently interlocked rotaxane. In Figures 
 11.9  and  11.10  are two capping reactions that encapsulate dyes inside CD to produce 
acene 28   and cyanine rotaxanes.  29   Similar methods have also been used to make phenyl-
acetylene, 30   and oligo(thiophene) rotaxanes.  31   With the larger   γ  - CD it is possible to 
simultaneously encapsulate two dyes and make homo - and hetero - [3]rotaxanes that can 
achieve extremely efﬁ cient energy transfer between the chromophores.  32 While water is 
a useful solvent for driving hydrophobic dyes into the CD cavity to make the precursor 
threaded complexes, it does limit the scope of the capping reactions in that they must be 
water compatible. 
 The acene [2]rotaxane in Figure  11.9  was prepared by mixing an anthracene bisboronic 
acid with   β  - CD in water and conducting a Suzuki capping reaction to produce the per-
manent rotaxane. Unlike the free acene axle, the rotaxane does not exhibit an excimer

emission band at elevated concentration, indicating that the surrounding CD prevents 
self - aggregation of the acene chromophore. However, a dye rotaxane structure does not 
automatically prevent all types of bimolecular reactions with the encapsulated dye. For 
instance, anthracene is well known to undergo a [4+4] photodimerization process as well 
as a [4+2] cycloaddition with singlet oxygen to produce a bridged 9,10 - endoperoxide. A 
comparison of the reactivities of the acene axle component and the rotaxane in Figure 
 11.9  showed that the surrounding   β  - CD completely prevented the photodimerization 
process, but it only slowed the rate of photooxidation by about an order of magnitude. 
Thus, the chemical protection provided by the surrounding CD is diminished when the 
reactant is sterically small like molecular oxygen. 
 The difﬁ culty in preventing dye photooxidation is further illustrated by the cyanine 
rotaxane in Figure  11.10 . Cyanine dyes are a very popular class of red and near - IR ﬂ uo-
rescent dyes but they are susceptible to photobleaching. It is known that photogenerated 
singlet oxygen can decompose cyanine dyes by oxidative cleavage of the conjugated 
double bonds.  33   The capping reaction shown in Figure  11.10  has been optimized for gram 
scale production of the cyanine rotaxane which has similar photophysical properties as 
the free dye.  34   In terms of photostability, air saturated solutions of free dye decompose 
3.9 times faster than encapsulated dye, a modest amount of oxidative protection. The 
above two rotaxane examples demonstrate the difﬁ culty in sterically blocking dye photo-
oxidation. Future efforts to design high stability dye rotaxanes should be based on a clear 
understanding of the chemical and photochemical degradation processes and where they 
occur on the chromophore. By knowing what decomposition reactions to prevent, more 
effective encapsulation strategies can be developed. 
 The encapsulation of squaraine dyes as axle components inside rotaxanes has lead to 
some dramatic improvements in dye performance. Squaraines exhibit sharp, strong 
absorption and emission bands in the red and near - IR wavelengths and they are attractive 
dyes for bioimaging. 35 However, there are two serious limitations; they tend to form non -
 ﬂ uorescent aggregates and the dye ’ s electron deﬁ cient C 4 O 2  core is susceptible to chemi-
cal attack by nucleophiles.  36   Both of these drawbacks are overcome by dye inclusion 
inside a tetralactam macrocycle, a process that is driven by hydrogen bonding interactions 
with the squaraine oxygens. First - generation squaraine rotaxanes were prepared in 
20 – 30% yield by a templated clipping reaction in weakly polar organic solvent.  37 The 
rotaxanes exhibit very similar photophysical properties as the precursor squaraines, but 
the encapsulating macrocycle protects the dye from nucleophilic attack. For example, the 
unprotected squaraine loses its blue colour within minutes in serum solution while 
squaraine rotaxanes retain their colour for days. In addition, the surrounding tetralactam 
macrocycle diminishes squaraine absorption band broadening by inhibiting interchromo-
phoric interactions both in solution and solid state. 
 It is straightforward to conjugate cell targeting ligands to squaraine rotaxanes and 
produce ﬂ uorescence probes for bioimaging. For example, attachment of zinc coordinated 
dipicolylamine groups, which are known to target bacterial cell surfaces, produces a 
bright, photostable, and non - toxic probe for bacteria imaging.  38   This probe is over 20 
times more photostable than an analogous probe composed of the popular cyanine dye, 
Cy5. The enhanced photostability allows acquisition of ﬂ uorescent movies of bacterial 
cell division; these movies were previously unavailable due to photobleaching of the 
ﬂ uorescent probe. 39

 A series of second - generation squaraine rotaxanes can be produced using the anthrylene 
tetralactam macrocycle shown in Scheme  11.1 . The high solubility of this macrocycle in 
organic solvents allows squaraine rotaxanes to be produced in essentially quantitative 
yield by either a thermally promoted slipping process that forces the dye through the 
macrocyclic cavity,  40   or capping chemistry that covalently adds stopper groups to a self -
 assembled pseudo - rotaxane complex. 41   The tetralactam macrocycle wraps tightly around 
the squaraine dye and there is about a 40   nm red - shift in the emission wavelength, a 
phenomenon that has been observed with a related perylene diimide rotaxane system. 42

Molecular Encapsulation
Thus, the structure of the surrounding macrocycle is a molecular design parameter 
that can be used to non - covalently ﬁ ne - tune the photophysical properties of the encapsu-
lated dye. 
 11.5  Permanent Encapsulation Inside Inorganic Matrices 
 A conceptually different way to permanently encapsulate dyes is to trap them inside 
inorganic cages.  43   The most straightforward approach is to employ preformed molecular 
sieves or zeolites. If the dye is smaller than the diameter of the pores then solution and 
gas phase diffusion techniques can be used to load the dye molecules inside the zeolite 
(Figure  11.13 ). Shown in Figure  11.14  is a more sophisticated approach, which assembles 
the dye inside the zeolite (i.e.  ‘ ship in a bottle synthesis ’ ) using a precursor molecule 
that is grafted to the cavity walls.  44   These dye doped inorganic materials can act as solar 
energy capture devices and as optical sensors. An example of the latter is a ﬂ uorescent 
humidity sensor based on Nile Red encapsulated inside NaY zeolite supercages.  45 The 
ﬂ uorescence of Nile Red is sensitive to solvent polarity and incorporation within the 
zeolitic pores further enhances this effect, partly because the zeolite cavities are 
hydrophilic.   
 Clay materials, like zeolites, have also been explored as naturally occurring micropo-
rous hosts for dyes.  46   Trapping the dyes within these three dimensional scaffolds provides 
protection from external quenchers but inhibits aggregation behaviour by immobilizing 
and segregating them within the framework of the material. Interestingly, dye encapsula-
tion within micro and mesoporous materials was performed by the ancient Mayas several 
thousand years ago. Indigo, a naturally derived blue dye extracted from many plants of 
the genus  Indigofera , has modest stability but encapsulation inside palygorskite clay 
produces a dye of exceptional stability, one that is inert to high and low pH solutions, 
photobleaching and oxidation. The packing arrangement of the dye within the clay is still 
a matter of investigation but computational and spectroscopic evidence suggests the 
zeolitic water in the clay is released upon inclusion of indigo and H - bond contacts

between the dye walls of the clay and structural water molecules (those molecules that 
make up the scaffold of the clay) form stabilizing interactions. 47 
 The desire to produce non - toxic ﬂ uorescent nanoparticles for bioimaging and diagnos-
tic applications has lead to new methods of doping dyes within the lattice structures of 
silica nanoparticles.  48   The trapped dyes exhibit enhanced stability, increased ﬂ uorescence, 
and decreased self - aggregation. A range of related microemulsion methods have been 
reported to produce dye - doped and core - shell silica nanoparticles.  49   In some cases, the 
dyes are covalently conjugated to the silicate precursor which leads to greater dye dis-
persal within the nanoparticle.  50   An alternative method employs a cationic surfactant to 
template the formation of mesoporous silica containing the molecularly dispersed dyes. 
Fluorescent silica nanoparticles are potentially useful as sensors for lab - on - chip diagnos-
tics and as probes for cell and animal imaging. Nanoparticle probes that contain photo-
sensitizing dyes are potential candidates for photodynamic therapy.  51 Most photosensitizing

Molecular Encapsulation
dyes are hydrophobic, which leads to formulation problems and poor  in vivo distribution. 
Covalently attaching photosensitizers to the nanoparticles enables convenient delivery to 
tumor cells without the problem of dye diffusion away from the target site. Molecular 
oxygen can penetrate the pores of the nanoparticles, thus irradiation of the target site after 
nanoparticle delivery leads to singlet oxygen release within the tumor. Additional cell 
targeting properties can be acquired by decorating the nanoparticle surface with afﬁ nity 
ligands or cell penetrating peptides. 52 
 11.6  Conclusion 
 Most of the organic dyes that are currently employed in colourimetric and biosensing 
assays have been around for many decades and although they do not always have optimal 
performance properties they remain useful because they have low toxicity and relatively 
low cost. The emergence of new technologies in frontier industries like biomedicine, 
materials science, and nanotechnology creates a growing demand for dyes that have 
improved performance. One of the major attractions of molecular encapsulation is that it 
uses established, familiar dyes as central chromophores; however, a potential drawback 
with some applications is that the encapsulation matrix will add considerable size and 
mass to the ﬁ nal product. In most cases, the crucial factor that will determine the eventual 
scientiﬁ c and societal impact of encapsulated dye products is the economic cost of 
fabrication, and there is a continuing need to develop high - yielding templated synthesis 
methods. The remarkable synthetic success that has been achieved in recent years is 
reason to expect further major progress. Intellectually, dye encapsulation is likely to 
expand as an interdisciplinary ﬁ eld, connecting fundamental scientists and engineers who 
aim to invent next - generation nanoscale devices and molecular machines.

Organic Cations in 
Constrained Systems

 12.1  Introduction 
 There is growing interest in artiﬁ cial receptors that serve as sensors of charged species. 
Studies of the interaction between hosts and organic cations can also advance our under-
standing of the recognition properties of biological systems. Because many bioactive 
molecules such as the neurotransmitters acetylcholine, serotonin, nicotine, or protonated 
 γ  - aminobutyric acid are ammonium ions, the complexation of these organic cations is of 
particular interest. Aliphatic biogenic amines are being monitored in several foodstuffs 
like ﬁ sh, meat cheese and wine during ageing and storage. 1 
 The design of selectively bound host – guest complexes is a challenge for supramolecu-
lar chemistry. This chapter deals with host – guest systems including cyclophanes, calix-
arenes, homocalixarenes, and cucurbiturils as hosts. Such molecular containers (cavitands) 
should provide a cavity surrounded by rigid walls that enables close proximity of the 
guest to the wall of the host. In order to take advantage of cation – π  interactions, aromatic 
subunits are necessary. The inﬂ uences of shape, rigidity, and the chemical structure of 
the host molecules as well as the nature of the organic cations will be reviewed. More 
complex systems such as sensors and switchable host – guest complexes are applications 
which will play a pronounced role in the development of new receptors developed from 
base structures of the hosts.

 12.1.1  Hosts 
 For binding to occur, a host must possess suitable binding sites with favourable electronic 
properties such as polarity and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor abilities that complement 
those of the guest. Cyclophanes such as  I , calixarenes  II , homocalixarenes  III , and resor-
cinarenes  IV fulﬁ l these requirements (Scheme  12.1 ). Cucurbiturils  V  are water soluble 
container molecules without aromatic subunits. Therefore, both electrostatic interaction 
other than cation – π interaction and hydrophobic interaction play a dominant role. 
 The host molecules considered here possess a more or less rigid structure surrounding 
a cavity that can form complexes with organic cations having various shapes. The strength 
of binding depends on several parameters such as: 
 •  The type of interaction between host and guest. 
 •  The solvent used. 
 •  The rigidity of the host. 
 •  The anion. 
 1.  While cation – π interaction 2   plays an important role not only in biological systems as 
illustrated by acetylcholine esterase,  3 artiﬁ cial receptors with sidewalls containing 
aromatic groups also exhibit this type of interaction with organic cations. Hydrogen 
bonds ( + N − H  …  X) between the guest ammonium ions, formed by protonation of 
amines, and the functional groups (X   =   O, N) of the host molecule may be stronger 
than other electrostatic forces such as cationic – π interaction.

 Charged groups such as sulfanyl substituents may serve as secondary binding sites 
operating through salt bridges. 
 2.  The solvent strongly inﬂ uences the complexation of organic cations. The more fully 
the cations are solvated, the lower will be the free energy gained by the interaction 
between the host and the organic cation. Cationic – π  interaction has the greatest inﬂ u-
ence in low polarity solvents such as chloroform. In more polar solvents, such as 
acetonitrile, cation – π  interactions are distinctly diminished as compared with chloro-
form or tetrachloroethane. Above all, hydrophobic interactions play the main role in 
aqueous solution. Furthermore, CH – π  interaction may contribute to the overall binding 
strength. 
  3.     To bind guests effectively, a host must have binding sites which are complementary 
to the properties of the guest molecule. The electronic character of the host must match 
that of the guest. The conformation of the host must supply strong interactions at the 
proper distances and angles. If a host does not undergo a signiﬁ cant conformational 
change upon complexation, it is preorganized. On the other hand, a high ﬂ exibility of 
the host consumes energy which is then not available for the binding process. The 
overall free energy of complexation represents the difference between the unfavourable 
reorganisation energy and the favourable binding energy. However, strongly preorgan-
ized hosts may hinder the formation of the complexation transition state leading to 
slower guest binding kinetics (slow exchange results). In contrast, conformationally 
ﬂ exible hosts are able to adjust rapidly to complexation conditions, and both compl-
exation and decomplexation are rapid (fast exchange). 
  4.     Because ion pairs are formed in low polarity aprotic solvents, the anion of organic 
cations also contributes to the complexation. It has been found that the stability of 
complexes between aromatic receptors and ammonium and iminium ions is decreased 
in the order picrate > triﬂ uoroacetate > I  −  > Br  −  > Cl  −  > tosylate > acetate. 4   Thus, the lower the 
cation - anion attraction, the stronger is the cation – π interaction. 5 
 Hosts must provide not only a sufﬁ cient interior concave surface, but also an opening 
for accepting the guest. A large opening leads to a rapid in - out exchange and consequently 
to small binding constants. A small opening may not provide a portal large enough for 
the guest molecules to enter. Accordingly, gated (constrictive binding) and non - gated 
hosts may result. 6 
 12.1.2  Guests 
 The organic cations of the types  A  –  D are considered in this chapter (Scheme  12.2 ). 
 Both the charge density and the shape of the cation will mainly govern the interaction 
with the  π  - basic cavity of the hosts of types  I  –  IV  (Scheme  12.1 ). The accessibility of 
the cavity of a particular host is controlled both by the size of the cavity and by the con-
formational mobility of the host. 
 Ammonium ions  A  represent a special guest class because the cation can be formed 
by proton transfer in acidic solutions or by acidic functionalities such as the OH - groups 
of the calixarenes. The N + H - bond allows formation of ionic hydrogen bonds with H - bond 
acceptors such as oxygen (e.g., at the narrower rim of calixarenes  II  or at the wider rim 
of resorcinarenes  IV ). In spherical tetraalkylammonium ions  B , the positive charge is 
dispersed over the four alkyl groups. In contrast, the positive charge is non - symmetrically

distributed in the ﬂ at aromatic iminium ions of the type  C . The charge of aryltropylium 
ions  D  (R   =   Ar) is strongly delocalized between the tropylium moiety and the aryl sub-
stituent. Therefore, the question arises as to whether both parts of these guests are able 
to orient toward the interior. Additionally, both  C  and  D  may interact with aromatic units 
of the hosts by  π - stacking. 
 12.1.3  Structure – Interaction Relationships 
 The quality of synthetic receptors toward binding of organic cations may be evaluated by 
thermodynamic parameters such as binding constants, enthalpy (  ∆ H), entropy (  ∆ S) and 
Gibbs free energy (  ∆ G) and also by structural parameters like complexation - induced shifts 
of proton resonances (CIS) as determined from NMR - spectroscopy and crystal structures. 
Determination of binding constants and binding energies can be determined with spec-
troscopic methods (UV - Vis - , NMR, and Mass spectroscopy). In most cases, K is deter-
mined with titration experiments followed by regression plot analysis of the observed 
data based on suitable equations.  7   UV - Vis and NMR spectroscopy are complementary 
methods, functioning in different concentration ranges. 
 Compared with spectroscopic techniques, calorimetry is a universal methodology; it 
functions independently of probe peculiarities, and has the advantage of yielding enthalpy 
as a directly observable experimental result.  8   Depending on the extent of interaction 
between the components from a single calorimetric experiment, the main state functions 
of the binding process (  ∆ H,   ∆ S and   ∆ G) are accessible. Because in most cases the com-
plete set of parameters is not available, different hosts related to the binding strength and 
selectivity of various guests may be compared on the basis of binding constants. The CIS 
values taken from  1 H NMR titration experiments provide valuable information about the 
arrangement of the guest within the host. Protons deep inside the cavity of the host often 
are strongly shifted up - ﬁ eld due to the shielding effect of the aromatic sidewalls. All 
methods mentioned above also provide the stoichiometry of complexes. 
 12.2  Host – guest Complexes with Organic Cations 
 12.2.1  Cyclophanes 
 The host  I - 1  (Scheme  12.3 ) possesses an opening that allows guests such as acetylcholine 
variants  B - 1  and  B - 2  to enter the hydrophobic cavity. The receptor has a high afﬁ nity for 
these ammonium ions (  ∆ G  =  − 5.3 and  − 5.2  kcal  mol  − 1 , respectively) in aqueous solution. 
Probably hydrophobic interactions play the main role. Small changes in the size of the 
host cavity signiﬁ cantly affect host – guest interaction. 9   CIS values revealed that a loose 
association is required to achieve a strong binding of quaternary ammonium ions.

 The cyclophanes  I - 2 – I - 4 (Scheme  12.4 ) were synthesized to improve the afﬁ nity for 
protonated amines.  10   While tetraalkylated ammonium ions are strongly complexed by  I - 2 , 
unmodiﬁ ed protonated amines are not well bound. Simple protonated amines are more 
strongly solvated by water than alkylated ammonium ions.  10   Through the combination of 
interactions between host and guest, including cation – π , hydrophobic, and salt bridge 
interactions, the host  I - 4  (Scheme  12.4 ) can bind even well - solvated guests such as  A - 1 
 –  A3 ,  B - 3 – B - 5 , and  C - 1 ,  C - 2 . Only the binding of  B - 6  is not improved by salt bridge 
formation. Arginine - NH 2 ( A - 3 ) and arginine - containing dipeptides were strongly bound

in water solution ( ∆ G  =  − 6  kcal  mol  − 1 ). The effect of salt bridges in addition to cation – π 
interactions can be estimated as  ∼ 1  kcal  mol  − 1 . The ﬂ at, delocalized   π systems such as in 
 A - 3  and  C - 1  are well suited for stacking of aromatics of  I - 4 . Furthermore, the cation must 
have a region of intense positive electrostatic potential for an electrostatic interaction to 
occur with the carboxylate groups in an exposed aqueous environment. 
 12.2.2  Calix[n]arenes 
 The calix[n]arenes, perhaps the major class of organic receptors in supramolecular chem-
istry, are simple to synthesize and can be widely modiﬁ ed by substitutions at the aromatic 
cores and the phenolic OH - groups. Therefore, they can easily be adapted for speciﬁ c 
uses. 11 – 15   The vase - like conformation of calix[4] and, to a greater extent, the higher homo-
logues calix[5], calix[6], or calix[8]arene is characterized by a high mobility due to ﬂ ip-
ping of the aromatic units. However, the mobility of the calix[4] and calix[5]arenes in 
particular can be restricted by substituents at the narrower rim of the cone conformation 
(Scheme  12.5 ). Other conformations, such as the 1,3 - alternate arrangement of the aryl 
groups, do not play a signiﬁ cant role in binding of organic cations. 
 Calixarenes without ionisable substituents at the wider rim are not water soluble. Their 
complexation behaviour towards organic cations, has, therefore, been studied mainly in 
lipophilic solvents such as CDCl 3  and (CDCl 2 ) 2 . The cation – π  interaction is the main 
contribution to the stability of complexes and the association constants are rather low, 
ranging from 10 to 1000  M  − 1 (see Table  12.1 ). 
 The role of the cavity size of calixarenes is heavily predictable. For example, there is 
no signiﬁ cant hole - selectivity of hosts  II - 1 – II - 3  (Scheme  12.6 ) in complexes both with 
the tetraalkylammonium ion  B - 7  and the iminium ion  C - 3  (Table  12.1 ). Surprisingly, the 
ﬂ exible methylether  II - 1 , which exhibits interconversion between different conformers 
(cone - partial cone, 1,3 alternate), binds  B - 7  whilst the ﬁ xed cone with propyl groups at 
the narrower rim does not. 16 Also, the different cavity sizes of the calix[4]arene  II - 4 and 
calix[5]arene  II - 5 ﬁ xed in their cone - conformation exhibit no selectivity with the iminium

guest (compare Table  12.1 , entries 4 and 5, row  C - 4 ). In contrast, by restricting the acces-
sibility of the cavity by a bridge such as in host  II - 7  (Scheme  12.6 ) only monomethylam-
monium ion and not the larger di - , tri -  and tetramethylammonium ions are bound.  17 
Substituents at the wider rim generally have a considerable inﬂ uence on the binding of 
organic cations. The simplest and most often found inﬂ uence is the size of substituents 
which hinder guest binding due to steric interference. The bulky  tert - butyl groups used 
in the synthesis of calixarenes diminish the association constants (compare entries 5 and 
6 of Table  12.1 ). On the other hand, substituents may enlarge the cavity, thus supporting

 Scheme 12.7   CIS values (in Hz) observed for different protons in the complex  II - 8 / D - 2 18 
binding. The cycloheptatrienyl substituents of host  II - 8 (Scheme  12.6 and Table  12.1 ) 
seem to support the binding of ﬂ at iminium and aryl tropylium ions but hinder the com-
plexation of spherical ammonium ions (see Table  12.1 , entry 7). The conformation of 
host  II - 8  exhibits a ﬂ attened cone - conformation (see crystal structure in Scheme  12.6 ) 
which is suitable in order to bind ﬂ at aryltropylium ions. According to the CIS values of 
different protons in both the host and the guest, the guest is sandwiched between two 
cycloheptatrienyl substituents of the host. The tropylium moiety is closely bound to the 
cavity, whereas the aryl group is pointed towards the exterior (see Scheme  12.7 ).  18 A 
comparison of the CIS values (Hz) observed for the cycloheptatrienyl substituents with 
those of the protons of the aromatic rings indicates that the cationic guest is located in 
the upper part of the calixarene cavity. Free horizontal rotation of the aryltropylium ion 
is slow on the NMR time scale.   
 The cone conformation of tetraalkoxy calix[4]arenes is not completely blocked in solu-
tion but experiences residual mobility between two C 2v (ﬂ attened cone) structures.  19 The 
residual mobility can be diminished by functionalization at the narrower rim such as the 
introduction of crown bridges.  19   Also the alkylation of only two OH - groups at the nar-
rower rim seems to immobilize the cone conformation due to hydrogen bonds. Accordingly, 
tetraalkoxy derivatives of the host  II - 8  exhibit no or very low binding properties towards 
ammonium and iminium ions.  18   However, a particularly high association constant of 
K  =  3526 l  mol  − 1  was measured for the complex of the host  II - 9 (Scheme  12.6 ) with 
tetramethylammonium chloride. 20 The anion was proposed to act as a hydrogen bonding 
acceptor towards the phenolic OH - group of the substituents.

environment where most biological processes occur.  22  para - Sulfonated - calix[4]arene  II -
 10  is cone shaped with hydrophilic wide and narrow rims separated by a hydrophobic 
region. This compound binds the basic amino acids lysine and arginine with association 
constants of  ∼ 10 3  M  − 1  at pH 8.  23 Compounds  II - 11  and  II - 12 , in contrast, form only weak 
complexes. Acetylcholine  B - 2 formed very stable complexes with association constants 
of up to 4  ×  10 5 l  mol  − 1 with  II - 10 . 24 Notably, this afﬁ nity constant is comparable to the 
values observed for natural biological receptors. 
 A microcalorimetry study of the complexation of  II - 10  showed that the mobile host is 
able to bind tetraalkylammonium and alkylammonium ions in water with association 
constants up to 47000   M  − 1 . 25   The binding of all organic cations is enthalpy driven, but the 
role of hydrophobic interaction is difﬁ cult to evaluate. The entropic term is small and 
positive (except for the tetraethylammonium ion) and does not correspond to the expecta-
tions of the classical hydrophobic effect. But recent studies have indicated that the  ‘ non-
classical ’  hydrophobic effect is controlled by the enthalpy.  26   The positive sign of the 
entropic term indicates that the solvation of the alkyl chain plays a role. In comparison 
to  II - 10 , the host  II - 13 , locked in the cone conformation, binds the tetraethylammonium 
ion with an afﬁ nity that is one order of magnitude weaker (3160  vs . 25100 l  mol  − 1 ). 27 The 
binding is assisted by the charged sulfanyl groups at the wider rim. The host  II - 14 , which 
lacks these charged groups, forms a complex with the tetraethylammonium ion with an 
association constant of only 126 l   mol  − 1 . The ditopic guest  B - 9  (Scheme  12.6 ) is selec-
tively complexed with the aromatic ring pointing toward the interior of the cavity while 
the  II - 14  variant is able to recognise only the polar alkylammonium head group of  B - 9 
(Scheme  12.9 ). The complex geometry was discerned from the CIS values observed for 
protons of the aromatic ring and the protons of the methyl groups,  28   and indicates the

relative importance of electrostatic cation – π  interaction. For both guests, the inclusion 
process is enthalpy driven, but is entropically disfavoured. The negative entropic term 
results from a favourable term due to the desolvation of host and guest upon complexation 
and the unfavourable term is due to increased rigidity of the system upon inclusion of the 
guest. The higher stability of the hosts bearing the sulfonyl groups results from a greater 
desolvation of the host – guest complex. Surprisingly, the receptor  II - 10  is more efﬁ cient 
than the rigidiﬁ ed hosts, which may be explained by the assumption that the host is more 
adaptable to the shape of the guest due to its conformational mobility.   
 The calix[4]arenes  II - 15  and  II - 16  (Scheme  12.10 ) are only soluble in lipophilic media 
such as chloroform. Accordingly, the cation – π  interaction is expected to mainly control 
the strength of complexation of acetylcholine iodide  B - 2 , chinolinium perchlorate  C - 2 , 
and the tropylium hexaﬂ uorophosphates  D - 3  and  D - 4 (Scheme  12.10 ). Association con-
stants determined with the help of NMR titration have revealed that the charged host  II - 16 
binds organic cations more tightly than does the neutral host  II - 15  (compare column 3 in 
Table  12.2 ). 29   This outcome is surprising and probably the result of complementary 
cation – π  interaction, charge transfer interaction, and   π - stacking. 29   If the cationic host  II -
 16  binds organic cations, the question arises as to whether the cationic host interacts with 
itself. Dimers have been formed with an association constant of 230   M  − 1 (Scheme  12.11 ), 
which demonstrates that the attractive cation – π  interaction between each of the tropylium 
groups with the  π  - basic walls of the calixarene cavity is stronger than the repulsive inter-
action between the two positive charges. 
 Other calix[4]arenes combine both a host and a guest unit, such as the pyridinium -
 conjugated derivative  II - 17  (Scheme  12.12 ) which forms oligomers by cation – π interac-
tion both in solution, in the solid state, and also in the gas phase, as revealed by  1 H NMR 
spectroscopy, crystal structure determination, and crystallographic studies. 30 
 A general problem in the determination of association constants with the help of 
NMR titration appeared for the complexes  II - 16 / B - 2  and  II - 16 / D - 3 (Table  12.2 ). 
Different association constants were obtained by using signals from different protons 
(e.g., protons of the tropylium moiety and the dimethylamino group of guest  D - 3 ). 
This ﬁ nding can be interpreted as the formation of isomeric complexes in which dif-
ferent parts of the guest molecule are oriented into the interior of the host molecule 
(see Scheme  12.13 ). In such cases, the determination of the microscopic association 
constants of both complexes is not possible. Obviously the formation of isomeric

the absence of solvents, the selectivity of binding can be expected to be different from 
those observed in solution. 
 12.2.4  Homooxacalixarenes 
 The introduction of an additional atom such as oxygen into the methylene bridges has 
two effects: 1) The variety of cyclophanes is considerably increased (two examples are 
shown in Scheme  12.14 ). 2) Depending on the number and the distribution of the bridging 
oxygens, the variety of isomers and conformers is strongly increased. 3) The size of the 
cavity can be increased relative to the calix[4]arenes; enlarging the cavity may improve 
the binding strength. 4) The mobility of the cyclophanes is considerably increased. 32 Two 
effects may result  –  the higher mobility expends energy and the binding energy is dimin-
ished or the higher mobility enables the cyclophane to form the most suitable geometry 
of the host in the complex. 
 The whole set of compounds methylated at the narrower rim  III - 1 – III - 7 (Scheme 
 12.14 ) has been synthesized and the binding of picrates of organic cations  B - 2 ,  B - 10 
B - 11and  C - 3 (Scheme  12.6 , Scheme  12.14 ) was studied. 33 Despite having the same 
macrocyclic structure of the hosts, there are remarkable differences in both the measured 
association constants with different guests (see Table  12.3 ) and the CIS values extrapo-
lated to indicate complete complexation of the guest. These results indicate that the 
cavity must be somewhat differently arranged in the complexes with different cations 
due to the balance between cation – π  interaction and the strain energy of the host.

However, the differences in host geometry are much smaller in complexes than in free 
hosts. 33,34 
 If one assume that similar changes in solvation and in cation - anion attraction occur 
through complexation of a given guest by  III - 1 – III - 7 , then the association constants 
reﬂ ect the contributions of the reorganisation energy of the mobile host and the cation – π 
interactions. The hydrogen bonds at the narrower rim, and therefore both the position and 
the number of OH - substituents, help determine the shape of the host cavity in the host –
 guest complex. 
 12.2.5  Resorcinarenes 
 Resorcinarenes have some degrees of freedom for rotation around the C − C bonds of the 
connecting CH 2 - groups, which results in ﬁ ve conformations, namely crown, boat, chair, 
diamond and saddle.  35   The hydroxy groups at the wider rim must be linked in order to ﬁ x 
the receptor in the speciﬁ c cavitand conformation and to improve binding properties. 
 Phenolate resorcin[4]arenes of the type  IV - 1  (Scheme  12.15 ) are efﬁ cient hosts 
for organic ammonium ions in protic solvents in strongly alkaline organic media by 
simultaneous charge – charge and cation – π interaction. 36   A drawback of receptors such as 
 IV - 2  is the low selectivity towards alkyltrimethylammonium and bulkier tetraalkylam-
monium ions. 37 
 Increasing the wall of the resorcinarenes, as in  IV - 3 , could improve the selectivity.  38 
In protic solvents,  IV - 3  could combine the selectivity of cavitands with the high afﬁ nity 
of the resorcin[4]arene. The cavitand is built up if the three diaminophenyl groups adopt 
an axial conformation. The cavity with an open side binds selectively alkylammonium 
ions complementary in size and shape (see Figure  12.1  and Table  12.4 ).     
 The association constants were determined with the help of a competitive displacement 
assay using  B - 17  as a ﬂ uorescence indicator 38   (see Figure  12.2 ). Small changes in size 
have large consequences because the guest is inserted deeply in the cavity. The long 
chains present in  B - 13  can protrude due to the top openings of the host  IV - 3 , resulting 
in high afﬁ nity (Table  12.4 ). In contrast, tetraalkylated ammonium ions, and NH 4 + itself, 
exhibit dramatically weaker complexation behaviour, indicating a bad ﬁ t with the cavity 
of  IV - 3 . The host  IV - 4  exhibits selectivity in binding naturally occurring ammonium ions 
in D 2 O - saturated CDCl 3 solution. 39 Choline  B - 1 (K  =  420  M  − 1 ) and carnitine  B - 16 
(K  =  2050  M  − 1 ), compounds which are poorly soluble in water - saturated chloroform, are 
taken up by this host, but acetylcholine  B - 2 is not. 
 The four - wall water - soluble cavitand  IV - 5 (Scheme  12.16 ) forms a stable deep cavity 
that has a high afﬁ nity towards choline  B - 1  and acetylcholine  B - 2  (association con-
stants > 10 4 M  − 1 ) in D 2 O. 40   Interestingly, the trimethylammonium head of  B - 1 is pointed 
inward into the cavity of the host. In contrast, the long chain trialkylammonium ions, 
such as dodecyltrimethylammonium ion, are bound with the (helical folded) alkyl chain 
in the cavity, but with an association constant of  > 10 4 M  − 1 . In addition to the favourable 
electrostatic interaction between the tetracarboxylate wider rim and the tetraalkylam-
monium core, hydrophobic interactions dominate the binding in this case and reveal 
the bitopic character of both the host and the guest. Isothermal titration calorimetric 
data have shown that the complex formation is both enthalpically and entropically 
driven.

 Chiral discrimination of the host – guest interaction can be measured in the gas phase. 
Resorcin[4]arenes bearing chiral substituents are able to select chiral quaternary ammo-
nium ions. In these cases, complexation experiments were conducted by means of elec-
trospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. 41 
 12.3  Extended Hosts and Capsules 
 Complexation properties of calixarene hosts may be improved not only by enlarging the 
wall of the host but also by connecting two host molecules by bridges (see Scheme  12.17 ). 
Compared with the  ‘ mono ’ - calix[4]arene  II - 18 , the bridged hosts  II - 19  –  II - 22  exhibit a 
clear increase of the association constants determined with the help of NMR titration in 
CDCl 3  solution (see Figure  12.3 ).  42   In lipophilic media, ion pairs are complexed, and thus, 
different salts of the guest molecules were studied in order to compare complexation 
properties. As expected, both the charge distribution within the cation and the steric 
requirements of the ion pair, in which the anion is tightly bound to the cation, control the 
binding process. The spherical tetramethylammonium ion  B - 10  can bind with only minor 
steric adjustments and no such large differences of the association constants of different 
ion pairs are observed (Table  12.5 ). From CIS values, the structures given in Scheme 
 12.18 are proposed.

 The examples shown above demonstrate the improved binding properties caused by 
connecting two calixarene cavities by bridges at the wider rim. A different feature of 
binding of type A ammonium ions was reported for calix[5]arenes connected by bridges 
at the narrower rim (Scheme  12.19 ).  43 The  1 H NMR titration experiments with long chain 
alkylammonium ions such as  A - 5  reveal the nearly exclusive presence of polycapsular 
assemblies in CDCl 3 /CD 3 OD (9   :   1) solution. Another type of encapsulation of long - chain 
dialkylammonium salts was observed with the heterotetratopic host  II - 24 (Scheme 
 12.19 ). 44 
 Very high association constants ( > 10 6 M  − 1 ) for the formation of the capsular 1  :  1 
complex in CD 2 Cl 2 /CD 3 OD (2   :   1) solution were estimated for alkyl chains of C 12 – C 16 . 
The ureido functionality of the bridge at the wider rim of host  II - 24  supports the compl-
exation in nonprotic solvents by binding with anions such as chloride, picrate, or car-
boxylate (see Figure  12.4 ). Shorter alkyl chains are encapsulated by only a single cavity.

The formation of capsular complexes is further corroborated by ESI mass spectra of 
equimolar host – guest mixtures. 
 While the capsules described above were formed by, at least, bitopic hosts with cova-
lently connected calixarene moieties, capsules are also formed through noncovalent bonds 
such as hydrogen bonds if suitable guests are present. The encapsulation of a guest such 
as the tropylium ion  D - 5  is necessary since an empty cavity would be thermodynamically 
disadvantageous. Dimeric hydrogen - bonded capsules are formed from resorcinarenes 
bearing hydroxyl substituents at the wider rim both in the solid phase and in solution in 
the presence  D - 5  (Scheme  12.20 ). The high thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the 
complex  IV - 6 / D - 5 / IV - 6  arises from the cooperation of eight CO  …  HO hydrogen bonds 
and the cation – π  interaction between the tropylium ion and the resorcinol units (Scheme 
 12.20 ). 45 
 While the capsule  IV - 6 / D - 5 / IV - 6  is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, the cocrystallization 
of resorcinarene  IV - 7  with the rigid diquaternary alkylammonium salt  B - 18  yields a 
nanotubular structure held together by intratubular   π  …   π - interaction (see Figure  12.5 ). 46 
Use of the bromide anion, a weaker hydrogen bond acceptor (compared with chloride), 
drives the assembly process through weaker   π  …  π and cation – π interactions instead of 
hydrogen bonding. In contrast, capsules can be formed from resorcinarenes with the 
diethylammonium ion  B - 11 . 47

 The calix[4]arene  II - 25  (Scheme  12.21 ) is able to form capsules because of ureidoyl 
substituents at the wider rim. Tropylium salts form charge transfer complexes with both 
the monomer and dimers of  II - 25  in nonpolar solvents.  48   Due to hydrogen bonds formed 
in the equatorial region, the afﬁ nity of the tropylium ion towards the capsule formed by 
the dimer is much greater than that of benzene.

 12.4  Cucurbiturils 
 Cucurbiturils (CBs) are relatively poorly soluble in water, with only  CB - 5  and  CB - 7 
possessing modest solubility.  49   However, the solubility of  CB - 5  and  CB - 8 increases 
strongly in concentrated aqueous acid. Because of the negative electrostatic potential 
both at the portals and within the cavity, interaction with cationic guests is preferred. 
Accordingly, alkylammonium ions bind tightly in HCOOH/H 2 O 1  :  1 with association

CBs can lead to a constrictive binding, 51 and, accordingly, the exchange of bound and 
free guests is slow on the  1 H NMR timescale. The narrow portal also causes size selectiv-
ity for alkylammonium guests. While  A - 7 (K  =  80  M  − 1 ) and  A - 9 (K  =  320  M  − 1 ) are readily

functional group to be covalently attached to the AFM tip (see Figure  12.6 ).  53 Using this 
technology, the ammonium ion was shown to be more weakly bound than the trimethy-
lammonium ion. 
 The binding of  C - 3  by a simple calix[4]arene host in nonpolar media can be improved 
by a factor of 25 by the formation of host clusters on the surfaces of gold nanoparticles. 54 
 Applications of host – guest complexes are mainly directed towards the development of 
sensors. For example, acetylcholine detection at micromolar concentration is based on 
inclusion of a ﬂ uorophore containing the pyridinium unit ( trans - 4[4 - (dimethylamino)

styryl] - 1 - methylpyridinium tosylate) in water soluble calixarenes  II - 1  –  II - 3 (Scheme 
 12.6 ). The ﬂ uorescence of the guest is both hypsochromically shifted and drastically 
increased upon complexation. The presence of acetylcholine completely eliminates the 
new emission band of the bound ﬂ uorophore because acetylcholine replaces the ﬂ uoro-
phore within the cavity of the calixarene.  55   A sensor was developed by immobilizing the 
receptor  II - 1  on an oxide - containing silicon surface. An analogous system working in 
alcoholic solution was presented above in Figure  12.2 . 
 As a second example, the coupling of an enzymatic transformation with a dynamic 
host – guest exchange is also based on ﬂ uorescence switching. Combining the decarboxyla-
tion of amino acids with a decarboxylase allows the unselective binding of  CB - 7  to be 
used for highly selective amino acid sensing.  56  CB - 7  binds aliphatic amines and diamines 
in their ammonium form (see above), but the selectivity is low. The neutral ﬂ uorophore 
dapoxyl (Scheme  12.25 ) and the protonated amine, the product of the enzymatic reaction 
under physiological conditions, compete for encapsulation. The emission of the ﬂ uoro-
phore is strongly enhanced upon complexation. The replacement of the ﬂ uorophore by 
the ammonium ion quenches or  ‘ switches off ’ the ﬂ uorescence (see Scheme  12.26 ). The 
enantiospeciﬁ ty of the enzymatic reaction allows the enantioselective recognition of 
analytes with an achiral host.

molecular chemionics is based on molecular recognition.  57   Therefore, hosts with binding 
properties that can be tuned by an outer stimulus are of particular interest. The advantage 
of light driven changes is that no chemical fuels are necessary and no waste products are 
formed. 
 The host cavity of a resorcin[4]arene bearing two anthracene moieties at the wider rim 
can be switched by the known photodimerization of the two anthracene substituents 
resulting in a closed cavity. The process can be reversed by heating of the solution. 
Whereas the cavity of the open state is well suited to bind ammonium ions such as 2 - mer-
captoethylamine hydrochloride, the closed form does not bind ammonium ions. The 
afﬁ nity modulation has also been studied by single - molecule force spectroscopy (Figure 
 12.7 ). For this purpose, the host has been modiﬁ ed with four didecylsulﬁ de linkers in 
order to immobilize the host on gold surfaces. 58

 The cavity of the calix[4]arene  II - 26  bearing two acridane substituents is open and 
suitable to bind guests such as  C - 3 (K  =  1461  ±  458 l  mol  − 1  in CDCl 3  solution) and  C - 4 
(K  =  117  ±  16 l  mol  − 1 ) (Scheme  12.27 and Figure  12.8 ). 59 In contrast, the cavity is blocked 
by two acridinium substituents formed by photoheterolysis.  60   Therefore, the calixarene in 
its acridinium state does not bind guests  C - 2  or  C - 4 . Thus, organic cations can be bound 
and released depending on the state of the host. 
 12.6  Conclusions 
 This chapter has covered some of the developments in the ﬁ eld of supramolecular host –
 guest complexes with organic cations. Cation – π  interaction may play a signiﬁ cant role, 
while charge - charge attraction often supports the binding process. The negative electro-
static potential at the portals and within the cavity of cucurbiturils has important conse-
quences for their recognition of cationic guests. However, a detailed understanding of 
cause/effect relations is difﬁ cult to derive. We have seen the effects of host structure on 
the stability and strength of the complexes through the examples given in this chapter. A 
host should provide a suitable surface and chemical complementarity to the organic cation 
to enable optimal interaction energy. Rigidiﬁ ed calixarenes and resorcinarenes as well as

 Scheme 12.27   Photochemical and thermal switching between  II - 26 and the 
corresponding  II - 27 
extended structures may overcome the entropic losses that occur upon complexation and 
may increase the enthalpic driving force through increased contacts between host and 
guest. In recent years, the complexity of host systems has been considerably increased. 
Modiﬁ ed calixarene and resorcinarene receptors for distinct functionalities are the focus 
of much interest. Switchable receptors and host – guest complexes as sensory material hold 
great promise and will emerge in the near future. In many cases, the physical properties 
of guests (pK - values, ﬂ uorescence efﬁ ciency, chemical reactivity) are changed by com-
plexation which can afford an increasing number of applications. Nevertheless, a greater 
emphasis should be given to extending the understanding of the cause - effect relationships 
of the binding properties in order to facilitate more rational approaches to receptor design.

Proteins as Host for 
Enantioselective Catalysis: Artiﬁ cial 
Metalloenzymes Based on the 
Biotin – Streptavidin Technology 
 Jincheng  Mao and  Thomas R.  Ward 
 Department of Chemistry, University of Basel, CH - 4056 Basel 
 13.1  Introduction 
 In order to meet the ever increasing demand for enantiopure compounds, heterogeneous - , 
homogeneous -  and enzymatic catalysis have evolved independently in the past.  1,2 Although 
all three approaches have yielded industrially viable processes, the latter two are the most 
widely used and can be regarded as complementary in many respects. 3 
 From the viewpoint of molecular encapsulation, enzymes have evolved to accommo-
date and orient their substrate within a well - deﬁ ned environment provided by the protein, 
Figure  13.1 a. In many cases, the substrate is embedded within the enzyme. In contrast, 
homogeneous catalysts typically possess a (chelating) ligand which occupies one hemi-
sphere around the metal, while the substrate occupies the other hemisphere. The main 
effort in catalyst optimization has thus been to extend the reach of the selectivity - orienting 
ligand, Figure  13.1 b. 
 With the aim of complementing the well established ﬁ elds of homogeneous and enzy-
matic catalysis, organocatalysis and artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes have witnessed a recent 
revival. 4,5 Artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes, result from combining an active but unselective 
organometallic moiety with a macromolecular host (protein or DNA), Figure  13.2 . 
 Both Kaiser and Whitesides suggested the possibility of creating artiﬁ cial metalloen-
zymes in the late 1970s already.  6,7   However, there existed a widespread belief that proteins

and organometallic catalysts are incompatible with each other. This severely hampered 
research in this area at the interface between homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis. 8 
Since 2000 however, there has been an increasing interest in the ﬁ eld of artiﬁ cial metal-
loenzymes for enantioselective catalysis. 9 – 13 
 For the localization of an organometallic moiety within a macromolecular host, three 
anchoring strategies can be envisaged: covalent, dative or supramolecular.  5 Using such 
approaches, enantioselective artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes have been created for hydrolysis, 12 
hydrogenation,  14 – 17 transfer hydrogenation, 18 allylic alkylation, 19 sulfoxidation, 20 – 24 epoxi-
dation, 25,26 dihydroxylation, 27 Diels – Alder, 28,29 trans - amination, 30 Michael addition 31 and 
ﬂ uorination. 32   Comparatively, supramolecular anchoring appears as the most appealing, 
since its allows separate variation of both biological and chemical components, followed 
by straightforward combination of the organometallic moiety and the macromolecular 
host. In addition, no chemical modiﬁ cation step is required after the incorporation of the 
catalyst precursor, thus ensuring the integrity of the organometallic species. In recent 
years, we have been exploiting the biotin – avidin technology for the creation of artiﬁ cial 
metalloenzymes for enantioselective catalysis. Herein we summarize the challenges and 
our progress in this area. 
 13.2  The Biotin – Avidin Technology 
 The biotin – avidin technology, often referred to as molecular Velcro, relies on the very 
high afﬁ nity of biotin for either avidin or streptavidin  –  (strept)avidin hereafter.  33 The 
versatility of this technology can be traced back to the following features: 
  i)   
  The nearly irreversible interaction between biotin and (strept)avidin relies solely on 
hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions and thus can reliably take place in a 
variety of environments (cell, blood, surfaces, etc.) under mild conditions. 
  ii)     A straightforward amide bond - forming reaction allows to append a biotin moiety to 
nearly any probe. This derivatization of the valeric acid side chain of biotin does not 
signiﬁ cantly affect the high afﬁ nity of the biotin – avidin couple. 34 
 iii)  (Strept)avidin possesses a homotetrameric   β  - barrel structure with four equivalent 
biotin - binding sites. This allows to bring into proximity different moieties via the 
biotin – avidin technology. 
  iv)     (Strept)avidin is a very robust protein scaffold which can be easily handled by unex-
perienced chemists without the risk of loosing biotin - binding activity. 
 In the past four decades, this versatile tool has found numerous applications in afﬁ nity 
chromatography, signal ampliﬁ cation, drug delivery, immunoassays, immobilization etc.  35 
 Inspired by the pioneering work of Whitesides,  7,17   we reasoned that we could exploit 
the biotin – avidin technology for the creation and optimization of artiﬁ cial metalloen-
zymes. Introduction of a biotin anchor on a chelating ligand ensures the localization of 
an organometallic moiety within a chiral environment provided by (strept)avidin. We 
endeavored to use the modern tools of genetic and chemical optimization to ﬁ ne - tune the 
second coordination sphere of the resulting artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes. The main stages 
include (i) mutation and overexpression of the (strept)avidin isoform in a suitable host, 
(ii) isolation, puriﬁ cation and quantiﬁ cation of the activity of the mutated (strept)avidin,

(iii) synthesis of the biotinylated catalyst precursor and incorporation within (strept)
avidin, (iv) catalysis, and (v) product isolation and analysis. 
 One of the most attractive feature of this approach is the diversity generated by com-
bining both chemical and genetic optimization strategies. 36 Following this approach, we 
have been able to develop artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes for the hydrogenation, the allylic 
alkylation and the transfer hydrogenation reaction. 
 13.2.1  The Chemical Optimization Dimension 
 In the spirit of homogeneous catalyst optimization, variation of the ﬁ rst coordination 
sphere provided by a chelating ligand often has a signiﬁ cant impact on the performance 
of the resulting catalyst. Inspired by some of the best homogeneous catalysts, a series of 
aminodiphosphines and amidosulfonamides were synthesized and coupled with the 
biotin - anchor. We reasonned that introduction of a spacer between the biotin and the 
chelating ligand would project a different chiral environment for each biotin – spacer –
 ligand combination, thus offering a straightforward optimization strategy. The most 
versatile ligands and spacers are sketched in Figure  13.3 . 
 13.2.2  The Genetic Optimization Dimension 
 Considering the ease of recombinant protein production in various hosts, we set out to 
produce streptavidin (Sav hereafter) in  Escherichia coli  and avidin (Avi hereafter) in 
 Pichia pastoris . 37,38   Although in our hands both proteins could be overexpressed to high 
levels (230  mg  l  − 1 cell culture and 330  mg  l  − 1  cell culture respectively) streptavidin was 
eventually preferred over avidin for the following reasons: 
  i)   
  In contrast to streptavidin, avidin is glycosylated. This is a source of inhomogeneity 
and thus may cause reproducibility concerns. In addition, the inhomogeneity renders 
crystallization more challenging. 
  ii)     Each avidin monomer possesses a single intramolecular disulﬁ de bridge. As a con-
sequence, the protein cannot be denatured and renatured, which is a limitation for 
puriﬁ cation purposes. 
 iii)  E. coli  is a well behaved and a very easy to handle organism for the overexpression 
of recombinant proteins. However, it should be emphasized that  P. pastoris secretes 
the recombinant proteins in the culture medium, which could be a major asset for 
future directed evolution studies. 
 In light of the above reasons and considering that our initial success was obtained with 
streptavidin rather than avidin,  14   we rapidly focused on streptavidin and mutants thereof 
as host for artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes. 
 Docking studies performed with either [Rh(COD)(Biot – 1 )] +  or [Ru(  η 6 - arene)H(Biot –
 IIIp – 2 )] within WT - Sav revealed that the potential energy surface describing the localiza-
tion of the metal within the protein environment was ﬂ at and the metal adopted different 
positions within a very small energy window.  39,40   Analysis of the C  α  – M distances revealed 
that the asymmetric carbon (C  α  ) of residue S112 Sav lied systematically closest to the 
metal center. Based on these  in silico  studies, we set out to produce all twenty Sav iso-
forms resulting from saturation mutagenesis at position S112X Sav.  41   Except for S112P

reacted with [Rh(COD)] +  and combined with a Sav isoform. The resulting artiﬁ cial

results are collected in Table  13.1 .  14,41 – 45   Based on these data, the following trends can be 
identiﬁ ed:

 both ( R ) - and ( S ) - enantiomers of the product can be obtained in good enantioselectivi-
ties ( > 90% ee, Table  13.1 entries 1 – 6) 
  ii)     chemical diversity (e.g. variation of the spacer) is a more versatile means for optimi-
zation that genetic diversity. This latter can be regarded as a ﬁ ne tuning step.

  iii)     introduction of conformationally constrained spacers (eg. proline  IV ) confers signiﬁ -
cant organic solvent tolerance to the systems. Both biphasic and DMSO/water mix-
tures yield good conversions and selections (Table  13.1 entries 3 – 5). 45 
 iv)  the artiﬁ cial hydrogenases follow Michaelis - Menten kinetics. Introduction of the 
catalyst within streptavidin contributes to improve both the activity (eg. phenomenon 
of protein accelerated catalysis, compare [Rh(COD)(Biot – 1 )] +  k cat 3.06  min  − 1 ,  K M 
7.38  mM, with [Rh(COD)(Biot – ( R ) - IV – 1 )] +  ⊂  WT Sav  k cat 12.30  min  − 1 ,  K M 4.36  mM) 
and the selectivity. 42 
 v)  although most ligand – protein combinations afford comparable levels of conversion 
and enantioselectivity for both substrates, certain combinations yield substrate spe-
ciﬁ c artiﬁ cial hydrogenases (Table  13.1 entry 6). 
 Having demonstrated the potential of artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes for the reduction of 
 N  - protected dehydroaminoacids, we turned our attention towards organometallic - 
catalyzed reactions where the enantiodiscrimination step occurs without coordination of 
one of the reactants to the metal centre. We anticipated that incorporation of the metal 
complex within a protein environment may steer the enantioselection without requiring 
transient coordination to the metal. In this context, we selected the palladium - catalyzed 
asymmetric allylic alkylation, the ruthenium - catalyzed transfer hydrogenation as well as 
the vanadyl - catalyzed sulfoxidation reaction. Indeed, these reactions are believed to 
proceed without prior coordination of the soft nucleophile, the prochiral ketone or the 
prochiral sulﬁ de respectively, Figure  13.5 . 
 13.4  Artiﬁ cial Allylic Alkylases 
 In the ﬁ eld of C − C bond forming reactions, palladium occupies a privileged position.  46 
In this context, the asymmetric allylic alkylation attracted our interest due to its unique 
outersphere attack of the malonate on the   η 3 - coordinated 1,3 - diphenylallyl moiety. 47 
 Following the above - described chemogenetic optimization procedure, we screened 
twenty one biotinylated ligands in conjunction with twenty two (strept)avidin isoforms 
for the allylic alkylation of 1,3 - diphenylallyl acetate. Addition of didodecyldimethylam-

monium bromide (DMB) allowed to signiﬁ cantly improve the yield of alkylation product 
 –  over the hydrolysis product, 1,3 - diphenylallylalcohol, formed predominantly in the 
absence of DMB (Figure  13.6 ). This screening revealed the following trends:  19 
   i)   
  The nature of the spacer plays a critical role in conferring activity to the artiﬁ cial 
alkylase. In most cases and despite the addition of DMB, hydrolysis product was 
formed predominantly. The best spacers are conformationally constrained: either 
proline  IV or  o - aminobenzoate  IIo , Table  13.2 , entries 1 – 3. 
  ii)     Despite the presence of chaotropic agents (surfactant and basic pH), the artiﬁ cial 
metalloenzyme behave remarkably well. While the high pH is required for the reac-
tion to proceed, the reaction carried out in the absence of DMB leads to a signiﬁ cant 
erosion of the conversion, with only a modest increase in selectivity, Table  13.2 , 
entries 3, 4. 
  iii)     As previously observed for the hydrogenation reaction, conformationally constrained 
ligands confer improved organic solvent tolerance. Reactions with [Pd(  η 3 - allyl)(Biot –
 IIo – 1 )] +  ⊂    S112A Sav can be performed in 45% DMSO without addition of DMB, 
Table  13.2 , entry 5. 48 
  iv)     Again here, the versatility of the chemical optimization allowed to rapidly identify 
an active biotinylated ligand. The genetic optimization can be regarded as a ﬁ ne 
tuning step: whereas most streptavidin isoforms yielded ( R ) - alkylation products in

( S ) - alkylation product, Table  13.2 entry 6. 
 13.5  Artiﬁ cial Transfer Hydrogenase 
 The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones is an effective way to prepare enan-
tiopure alcohols.  49   We were attracted to this reaction as we anticipated that one could 
exploit the reversibility of the reaction to perform either for the enantioselective reduc-
tion or for the kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols via oxidation.  50 This behaviour 
is reminiscent of alcohol dehydrogenases which can operate either as oxidases or 
reductases. 2 
 Incorporation of a biotinylated d6 - piano - stool complex bearing a biotinylated amino-
sulfonamide ligand into streptavidin afforded artiﬁ cial transfer hydrogenases for the 
reduction of acetophenone derivatives. A buffered solution (pH 6.25) containing sodium 
formate as a hydrogen source proved best in terms of conversion and of selectivity. 
Unexpectedly, the performance of the artiﬁ cial metalloenzyme was improved by raising 
the temperature to 55  ° C. 18,39,51   A combined chemogenetic procedure combining 21 piano 
stool complexes with the twenty S112X Sav isoforms allowed to optimize the activity 
and the selectivity of these hybrid catalysts for the reduction of prochiral ketones, Figure 
 13.7 . The following trends were identiﬁ ed: 52 
 i) 
 Only catalysts bearing the  para - substituted spacer biot – III p – 2  afforded any signiﬁ -
cant level of conversion. 
 ii)  Ruthenium - based catalysts [Ru(  η 6 - arene)H(Biot – III p – 2 )] outperformed either 
rhodium or iridium based systems [M(  η 5 - C 5 Me 5 )H(Biot – III p – 2 )]. 
 iii)  Under otherwise identical conditions, the benzene [Ru(  η 6 - p - benzene)H(Biot – III p – 2 )] 
and the  p - cymene [Ru(  η 6 - p - cymene)H(Biot – III p – 2 )] complexes afforded opposite 
enantiomers, Table  13.3 , entries 1, 2. 
  iv)     Various acetophenone derivatives could be reduced with good enantioselectivities up 
to 92% ee for ( S ) - products and 97% ee for ( R ) - products, Table  13.3 , entries 3, 4. 
  v)     In contrast, the selectivities obtained for the reduction of dialkylketones remained 
modest, Table  13.3 , entries 5, 6.

 In the context of transfer - hydrogenation, dialkylketones are challenging substrates as 
the major contribution to the enantiodiscrimination event is believed to be C − H · · · · · · π 
interactions between the   η 6  - bound arene and the phenyl moiety on the prochiral substrate, 
Figure  13.5 . 53 – 55   We anticipated that the introduction of additional sites of mutation in the 
proximity of the piano - stool moiety may allow to address this challenge. For this purpose, 
we invested considerable effort into crystallizing the most promising ( R ) - and ( S ) - selective 
artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes: [Ru( η 6 - benzene)Cl(Biot – III p – 2 )]  ⊂    S112K Sav and [Ru(  η 6 - p -

former and its structure is depicted in Figure  13.8 .  51   Based on this structure, we performed 
an additional round of mutations, concentrating on the close lying K121 and L124 resi-
dues and using WT Sav, S112K and S112A as background, thus affording a total 120 Sav 
isoforms. In order to speed up the optimization process, a straightforward Sav immobili-
zation procedure was implemented.  51 For this purpose, commercially available bioti-
nylated sepharose was added to the supernatant of the  E. coli  lysed cell cultures. After 
centrifugation, the immobilized Sav mutants, which on average possessed three remaining 
biotin - binding sites, are treated with an excess of [Ru(  η 6 - arene)Cl(Biot – III p – 2 )], and 
washed and tested in the presence of Sav. This second optimization round allowed to 
identify artiﬁ cial transfer hydrogenases which displayed much improved selectivities 
towards dialkylketones, Table  13.3 , entries 7, 8. 
 Having developed an efﬁ cient artiﬁ cial transfer hydrogenase, we attempted to apply 
the same methodology to the reverse reaction: the kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols. 
To our disappointment, we were forced to use strong oxidizing agents (eg.  t - BuOOH 
rather than acetone, in the spirit of an Oppenauer - type mechanism) to drive the reaction 
to completion.  56   We speculate that, in the presence of water, the ruthenium is unable to 
abstract the   β - hydrogen on the prochiral alcohol. 
 Despite the excitement generated by the X - ray structure, the localization of the bioti-
nylated metal complex within the protein environment was a source of disappointment. 
Indeed, we anticipated that the active catalyst would be encapsulated within the biotin -
 binding pocket of Sav rather than on the surface of the protein. To overcome this problem 
we tested whether the polar residues present within the biotin - binding pocket itself may 
be capable of binding a polar coordination complex. With this goal in mind, we tested 
the catalytic potential of vanadyl as a catalyst.  57

 13.6  Enantioselective Sulfoxidation Based on Vanadyl - loaded Streptavidin 
 Addition of vanadyl sulfate to Sav affords an artiﬁ cial oxidase for the sulfoxidation of 
prochiral sulﬁ des. The system is most efﬁ cient at low pH (2.2) and organic peroxides are 
required for efﬁ cient catalysis, Figure  13.9 . From the screening, the following trends 
emerge: 21 
 i) 
 A variety of prochiral sulﬁ des are oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxides with no 
overoxidation.  
  ii)     At room temperature and relying on 0.02 equivalents vanadium, the conversions are 
complete in most cases and the ( R ) - selectivities often exceed 90%, Table  13.4 , entries 
1 - 5. 
 iii)  Since there is no ligand, the system cannot be optimized chemically. 
 iv)  In the presence of biotin - loaded Sav, the sulfoxidation with VOSO 4  affords racemic 
product, suggesting that vanadium cannot compete for binding with biotin, Table 
 13.4 , entry 6.

  v)     It is widely recognized that residue D128 Sav is most important in biotin - binding.  58 
The mutant D128A Sav affords racemic sulfoxide, thus suggesting that the vanadyl 
moiety is located within the biotin - binding site, Table  13.4 , entry 7.

a chimaeric protein (Aviloop)  59   with improved properties for the sulfoxidation of 
dialkylsulﬁ des, Table  13.4 entries 8. 
 13.7  Conclusions and Outlook 
 As summarized here, artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes based on the biotin – avidin technology 
have developed into a versatile approach to enantioselective catalysis. In many cases, 
selectivities exceeding 92% ee could be obtained, relying on a chemogenetic optimization 
strategy. Such hybrid catalysts display features which are reminiscent of both homogene-
ous and enzymatic catalysis. 
 Comparing alternative anchoring strategies (i.e. dative, covalent or supramolecular),  5 
we speculate that a dative anchoring between an amino acid side chain and the catalyti-
cally active metal moiety may provide an attractive means to ensure a better encapsula-
tion. In this context, one should mention the interesting results recently disclosed by the 
groups of Kazlauskas and Soumillon.  25,26   Substitution of Zn by Mn in carbonic anhydrase 
yields an artiﬁ cial epoxidase (up to 55% ee ( R )). Along similar lines, Sheldon and co -
 workers investigated the sulfoxidation properties of a vanadium - incorporated phytase. 
After incorporation of vanadate into phytase from  A .  ﬁ cuum , the resulting semisynthetic 
peroxidase displayed moderate enantioselectivity (up to 66% ee ( S )) for the sulfoxidation 
of thioanisole derivatives in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, with very little detectable 
overoxidation.  20   In contrast to our systems, the above two examples of artiﬁ cial metal-
loenzymes display a very narrow substrate scope. This suggests that the dative anchoring 
strategy provides a more  ‘ enzyme - like ’  second coordination sphere environment (i.e. 
Lock - and - Key) for the substrate. 
 Although the reactions implemented so far are limited to model systems, we believe 
that artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes will reveal their full potential for transformations for 
which there exists to date no good homogeneous catalyst. In this context, our current 
efforts are directed towards the hydroxylation of alkanes (where overoxidation is dif-
ﬁ cult to prevent with homogeneous systems) as well as highly sequence - speciﬁ c DNA 
hydrolysis.

 14.1  Introduction 
 One of the most fascinating questions at the interface of chemistry and biology is how 
enzymes achieve the catalysis of chemical reactions. These biocatalysts bring about 
tremendous rate accelerations under mild conditions with often extreme chemo - , regio -  
and stereoselectivities. For decades, generations of biochemists, enzymologists and struc-
tural biologists have been attracted to this phenomenon, and consequently, a rather 
thorough understanding has been achieved regarding the catalytic mechanisms of protein 
enzymes. 
 As enzymes encapsulate multiple functionalities within their catalytic cavity, they have 
also served as a major source of inspiration for the ﬁ elds of biomimetic chemistry and 
supramolecular catalysis. Early mechanistic theories about how enzymes work have 
prompted scientists from various ﬁ elds to explore similar approaches for synthetic 
systems. One of these approaches is host - guest catalysis, where one or more substrates 
are bound in a cavity next to the catalytically active site. 
 Enzymes are, however, much more than just a combination of substrate binding site 
and the catalytically active site. Important contributions to enzymatic catalysis arise from 
substrate preorganization, restriction of substrate motion, catalyst dynamics, transition 
state binding, and desolvation of the substrates, and natural evolution has used these

strategies over long periods of time to ﬁ ne - tune catalytic properties. In synthetic systems, 
such effects could so far only be utilized to a lesser extent. 
 Since the early 1980s it has become clear that the exclusive assignment of enzymatic 
activity to the chemical substance class of proteins in incorrect, as ribonucleic acids were 
discovered that possess such activities. Most of these naturally occurring  ‘ ribozymes ’ 
(shortened for  ‘ ribo nucleic acid en zymes ’  catalyse (at least to our present - day knowledge) 
the hydrolysis and formation of phosphodiester bonds, and for some of these systems, 
high - resolution crystal structures and mechanistic investigations provide a basis for an 
understanding of how these ribozymes work. 1,2 Combinatorial chemistry on the other hand 
has allowed to isolate (or generate) RNA and also DNA catalysts with activities not 
known to exist in biology. It turns out that  –  although equipped with a much less varied 
arsenal of chemically different building blocks  –  nucleic acids can form tertiary structures 
with binding pockets and catalytic centres very much like proteins. 
 The history of ribozymes, in the true sense of the word, is connected to the so - called 
RNA world,  3,4   a hypothetic prebiotic stage in the evolution of life, where the majority of 
catalytic functions were effected by RNA, and proteins not yet existed. The idea of an 
RNA world alone implies that RNA should be practically omnipotent in the diversity of 
its catalytic potential, despite having been outperformed by proteins later on. The inves-
tigation of RNA catalysis provides a simpliﬁ ed and contrasting perspective on macro-
molecular catalytic mechanisms compared with protein enzymes, and an improved 
understanding of the chemical origins of ribozyme catalysis may add to our knowledge 
on macromolecular catalysis in general. 
 While enzymological research over several decades has provided a rather detailed 
understanding of how certain enzymes accelerate chemical reactions, knowledge about 
ribozyme mechanisms and catalytic strategies is scarce in comparison. For some natural 
ribozymes, mechanistic and structural studies were carried out, but artiﬁ cial ribozymes 
remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore it is unclear in many cases whether these cata-
lysts are passive containers working solely by substrate pre - organization, or whether there 
are speciﬁ c effects on the activation parameters of the reaction. 
 In this review, I will ﬁ rst give a brief overview on the types of chemical reactions cata-
lysed by naturally occurring ribozymes, including some mechanistic considerations. This 
is followed by a discussion of the methods used for generating new nucleic acid enzymes, 
and a compilation of artiﬁ cial ribozymes and deoxyribozymes. Finally, I will discuss the 
current knowledge on the arguably best - characterized artiﬁ cial ribozymes, namely RNA 
enzymes that catalyse the formation of C − C bonds by Diels – Alder reaction, with special 
emphasis on crystallographic and complementary mechanistic investigations. 
 14.2  Catalysis by Naturally Occurring Ribozymes 
 In the contemporary biosphere, ribozymes carry out a limited range of chemical reactions, 
mostly involving phosphoryl transfer, and in particular transesteriﬁ cation and hydrolysis 
reactions at internucleotide phosphodiester bonds (Table  14.1 ). They are widespread in 
nature, from bacteria and their phages, archaea, to yeasts and fungi and higher eukaryotes, 
and are used by these organisms mostly for processing of certain ribonucleic acids. They 
either cut oligomeric replication products to unity length, a crucial process in viral repli-

cation, they trim the ends of the precursors of tRNA, they remove an internal sequence 
fragment (intron) from a precursor transcript, or they destroy an mRNA in response to a 
signal. All these reactions are highly site - and sequence - speciﬁ c. In some cases, these 
ribozymes act on themselves (self - cleavage or  in - cis  cleavage, i.e., they are enzyme and 
substrate at the same time), in others they act as true enzymes on external RNA substrates 
( in - trans  cleavage). The RNA - cleaving enzymes can be grouped by the nature of the 
nucleophile they use for RNA cleavage (Table  14.1 ): They either utilize the 2 ′ - hydroxyl 
group of the ribose adjacent to the phosphodiester bond to be cleaved (small viral 
and viroidal RNAs), or a distant 2 ′  - OH group (in splicing, group II introns), a water 
molecule (Ribonuclease P), or a small organic molecule (group I introns). Finally, 
the peptidyl transferase activity of the ribosome is also ribozyme - based and catalyses 
what is arguably the most important reaction of the cell, the condensation of amino acids 
into polypeptides. 
 Just as protein enzymes must be correctly folded into the conformation required for 
catalytic activity, so must RNA. In general, the precise nature of Watson – Crick base 
pairing leads to the relatively easy formation of secondary structure. Most critical for 
catalysis and substrate binding is, however, the formation of the tertiary structure. The 
negatively charged phosphate backbone of RNA results in a strong electrostatic contribu-
tion to this process, and therefore metal ions play important roles in RNA structure for-
mation. The folded RNA structure can bind metal ions, either site - speciﬁ cally or diffusely, 
and these bound ions can play a direct role in catalysis. 1,2 
 Compared to proteins, RNA has only very limited resources to build a catalytic site. 
Only four monomeric building blocks with low structural and chemical diversity can be 
utilized. The nucleobases have hydrogen bond donors and acceptors that can be used to 
bind the substrate, and potentially to stabilize a transition state. In principle they could 
also act as general acids and bases, but their p K a  values are either too high or too low to 
make them signiﬁ cant contributors at physiological pH values. This situation can, however, 
be changed by neighbouring phosphate groups or metal ions. The second potential players 
are metal ions, and their associated water molecules. Metal ions can act as Lewis acids, 
or provide electrostatic stabilization of negative charge in a transition state. Water mol-
ecules contained within the inner coordination sphere may participate in general acid – base 
catalysis. In addition to chemical participants, RNA can also potentially exploit its struc-
ture to contribute to catalysis. Substrate binding can result in acceleration of

reaction velocity due to proximity and orientation, together with structural stabilization 
of the transition state. 
 Given the relative paucity of potential catalytic groups present in RNA molecules, 
ribozymes achieve some impressive rate accelerations. Typical values for the RNA -
 cleaving ribozymes reach about 10 6  - fold over the background reaction, with rates of 
 ∼ 1  min  − 1 , and some variants were reported to reach over 10  s  − 1 . 
 The ﬁ eld of natural ribozymes has been extensively reviewed. 1,2 
 14.3  How to Generate Artiﬁ cial  RNA and  DNA Catalysts 
 RNA molecules with new catalytic activities were ﬁ rst reported in the 1990s. These were 
isolated by a technique termed  in vitro  selection or SELEX (systematic evolution of 
ligands by exponential enrichment), starting from synthetic combinatorial RNA libraries 
(pools), which typically contain 10 14 – 10 15  different sequences, i.e., 10 14 – 10 15 chemically 
different compounds. These enormous complexities can only be handled since nucleic 
acid molecules are genetically encoded, i.e., they carry the information for their own 
replication. This property allows for an iterative deconvolution of the libraries over 
several rounds. Such SELEX experiments have led to nucleic acids that catalyse a broad 
range of chemical transformations, ranging from cleavage of amide - or carboxylic ester 
bonds to amide - bond - , C − C - and C − S - bond forming reactions to the catalysis of redox 
reactions (see below). 
 The vast majority of in vitro selection experiments, however, did not focus on catalysts 
but on RNA molecules that speciﬁ cally bind a given target molecule, so - called aptamers.  5 
The most crucial step in any variant of this technique is selection, meaning an effective 
distinction between desired and undesired species. It is in the selection step that the most 
decisive advances in ribozyme discovery were made, as will become clear in the discus-
sion below. The standard selection event in aptamer SELEX is a binding event, and 
consequently the desired molecules can be distinguished from the rest by physical separa-
tion, namely by afﬁ nity chromatography. 
 The basic (aptamer) SELEX protocol starts with a chemically synthesized DNA library 
(Figure  14.1 ). By using monomer (phosphoramidite) mixtures in solid phase oligonucle-
otide synthesis, huge complexities can be easily achieved. If, for example, a stretch of 20 
nucleotides is synthesized completely random by using a mixture of the four standard 
monomers, a mixture of 4  20 or 10 12   different DNA sequences is generated. In the second 
step, the single - stranded DNA is made double - stranded, and several copies are made by 
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using a DNA - dependent RNA polymerase, a 
single - stranded RNA library is ﬁ nally generated from the double - stranded DNA library 
that is used as input for the ﬁ rst round of selection. The target that the RNA molecules 
are expected to bind is immobilized on a solid support, and the RNA library is added and 
allowed to interact for a certain period of time. Non - binding RNAs are removed by 
washing, while binders are recovered. They are then converted into cDNA by reverse 
transcription, ampliﬁ ed by PCR, and this cycle is repeated several times until a signiﬁ cant 
fraction of the RNA binds to the immobilized target with high afﬁ nity. The enzymatic 
steps require the incorporation of certain constant sequence elements (primer binding 
sites, promoters) into the design of the starting library.

Chemical Reactions with RNA and DNA Enzymes

 Conceptually starting from this basic SELEX protocol, several strategies to create 
RNAs with catalytic properties were developed. The ﬁ rst one relies on transition state 
analogues (TSAs) and had been emulated from the catalytic antibodies ﬁ eld. Aptamers 
against transition state analogs of different reactions were raised and tested for catalytic 
activity. The Schultz group reported catalysis of a biphenyl isomerisation  6 and porphyrin 
metalation reaction.  7   Cholesterol esterase activity of yet another RNA isolated by the TSA 
approach was found by Chun  et al . 8   While all these RNAs act as catalysts, the rate accel-
eration was rather low (below 500 - fold in most cases), as compared to 10 3 – 10 5  for most 
TSA antibodies and up to 10 18  for natural enzymes. Other attempts to isolate catalytic 
RNAs via TSAs, for example for Diels – Alder reactions, have thus far remained at the 
stage of aptamer binding. 9 
 Better acceleration rates and catalysis of more complex reactions were obtained by 
direct selection. In this strategy, selection is not based on a binding event; rather it is 
based directly on the desired catalytic event. For example, if the to - be - catalysed reaction 
is phosphodiester hydrolysis, the RNA library is immobilized on solid support. The selec-
tion event is thus directly tailored to hydrolysis: active molecules cleave their covalent 
linkage to the solid support and thus dissociate from it. The catalytic event thus enables 
spatial separation of active and inactive molecules. Direct selection has therefore allowed 
to isolate catalysts for numerous RNA - modifying reactions, from hydrolysis and ligation 
to RNA alkylation, acylation, phosphorylation and many others (see below). 
 The use of reactants other than RNA in direct selection allows targeting of more 
complex reactions. An essential prerequisite is the attachment of a (non - RNA) reactant 
X to the RNA molecules, i.e., conversion of the RNA library into a RNA - reactant library. 
Assuming a desired RNA catalyst of the chemical reaction X    →    Z, which may include 
simple addition as in X  +  Y  →    Z, the selection has to be designed in a way to isolate

all RNA library members carrying the target reaction product Z. This can be through 
chemical trapping or afﬁ nity puriﬁ cation of Z directly, or by designing Y in a way that 
the ﬁ nal product contains a functional moiety of Y which allows facile afﬁ nity 
puriﬁ cation. 
 An exciting example for the former case is the ribocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol 
to benzaldehyde using NAD +  as a cofactor: the desired aldehyde product was chemically 
trapped by a biotin - conjugated hydrazine derivative.  10   This case will be more explicitly 
discussed below. The latter case has been successfully demonstrated by several labs 
employing a biotin - conjugated reactant Y thus allowing puriﬁ cation of the reactive species 
by immobilized streptavidin, a biotin - binding protein. A variant of direct selection uses 
tethered reactants. This design, tailored to ﬁ nd catalysts for the chemical addition of 
compound Y to compound X to yield the addition product Z, is depicted in Figure  14.2 . 
Reactant X is now attached to the RNA via a long poly(ethylene glycol) tether, allowing 
it to interact with potential catalytic pockets in the RNA that are spatially remote from 
either extremity. In our lab, using tethered reactants, a ribozyme was selected that cataly-
ses a Diels – Alder reaction. Anthracene tethered to RNA via a PEG - linker corresponds to 
reactant X, in this case a diene, and biotin - maleimide was employed as reactant Y, the 
free dienophile.  11   This design allowed easy isolation of the reaction product Z by strepta-
vidin agarose. 
 Depending on the reactivity of reactant Y towards the functional groups contained in 
RNA, its conjugation to species of the RNA library will occur with more or less site -
 speciﬁ city to the conjugated X - reactant. More reactive Ys may add to RNA at positions

other than the desired reactant X, thus also fulﬁ lling the practical requirements for selec-
tion and ampliﬁ cation. Results of such selections were occasionally reported in the litera-
ture. 12   A strategy to circumvent non - speciﬁ c addition involves the incorporation of a 
chemically orthogonal cleavage site between reactant X and the RNA library. After 
immobilization as a primary selection event, a secondary selection event is created by a 
treatment targeted speciﬁ cally to the cleavage site. If immobilization of a given RNA 
sequence is based on addition of reactant Y to reactant X with correct site speciﬁ city, the 
cleavage will release the desired sequence into solution for ampliﬁ cation. However, addi-
tion of Y to sites other than X anywhere in the RNA will result in persistent immobiliza-
tion during the secondary selection event, thus effectively removing unwanted species 
from the ampliﬁ cation cycle. The chemistry used for the cleavage event in the secondary 
selection step should not interact in any way with the rest of the conjugated library. 
Orthogonal approaches described to - date include a disulﬁ de bridge embedded within the 
tether, and photocleavable  o - nitrobenzyl groups. 
 The strategies to generate catalytic DNA molecules are almost identical and start with 
the same type of libraries. While one would intuitively expect that these selections are 
easier to perform since transcription and reverse transcription are eliminated from the 
selection cycles, in practice they are not, since the double - stranded DNA libraries result-
ing from PCR - type ampliﬁ cations are catalytically incompetent, and their conversion into 
high - quality single - stranded DNA libraries is not trivial. 
 14.4  The Catalytic Spectrum of Artiﬁ cial Ribozymes 
 In the following the scope of  in vitro  selected ribozymes will be described with special 
regard to organic chemistry. Several highlights will be discussed in detail. In Table  14.2  
the variety of reactions catalysed by ribozymes is summarized. 
 The catalytic spectrum of RNA can not be discussed without the background of a 
hypothetical prebiotic RNA world. As stated in the introduction, the concept of an RNA 
world means that RNA, at one point, may have performed almost all catalytic functions 
necessary for survival. As Woese points out,  25   the term survival does not necessarily apply 
to a discrete, living entity or even to distinct species, be they single molecules or single 
cells. Therefore, and because it is unclear which chemical reactions exactly might have 
been catalysed by RNA or other matter like catalytic surfaces, a complete picture of the 
RNA ’ s catalytic potential does not come with the RNA world hypothesis. Yet, there is a 
high number of chemical reactions and properties which have been predicted to occur in 
an RNA world. For a large number of the most important reactions, proof of the catalytic 
potential has meanwhile been given, including for example ribonucleotide polymeriza-
tion, aminoacylation, and peptide bond formation. 26 
 Although the RNA world presumably existed almost four billion years ago, X - ray -
 structures of the ribosome seem to exhibit fragments of this ancestral era. The structures 
revealed that RNA - mediated catalysis plays an important role in the peptide synthesis of 
the ribosome. The key step in translation is catalysed only by the ribonucleic acid com-
ponent of the ribosome, without any direct contribution of proteins from the spatial vicin-
ity. That impressively demonstrates the catalytic potential of RNA in a biochemical 
reaction that may arguably be called the most important ever.

 An artiﬁ cial ribozyme mimics this translation step of the ribosome.  27 The speciﬁ ty of 
this selected ribozyme is based on the recognition of an adenosine moiety of the amino 
acid ester and allows the utilization of leucine -  and phenylalanine -  as well as methionine -
 derivatized substrates. This tolerance for various amino acids indicates the possibility of 
selecting more general ribozymes for protein synthesis. Furthermore, a related ribozyme 
efﬁ ciently catalyses the synthesis of  ∼ 30 different dipeptides from an aminoacyl - adenylate 
substrate. Ribozyme - mediated synthesis of uncoded peptides might have been an impor-
tant step in the transition from a RNA to a peptide world before the emergence of the 
ribosome.  28 
 Another important development was the isolation of a ribozyme which performs nucle-
otide synthesis by forming a glycosidic linkage from activated ribose (pRpp)  17 in a way 
similar to the modern biosynthesis of nucleotides. 
 Before the discovery of catalytic RNA, the principal indications of a possible RNA 
world had been the role of tRNA and ribosomal RNA in translation, the use of RNA as 
genetic material in retroviruses, and the ubiquitous occurrence of RNA - related enzymatic 
co - substrates like GTP, ATP, AMP, cAMP, SAM, FADH 2  and NAD +  in all major meta-
bolic pathways. Clearly, the capability of RNA to employ these and other ubiquitous 
co - substrates in catalysis must be expected. 26 
 Deﬁ nitively a highlight in ribozyme research is the  in vitro  evolution of a ribozyme 
that oxidizes an alcohol in a NAD +  dependent manner. The resulting RNA - aldehyde was

trapped via a chemoselective modiﬁ cation with biotin hydrazide. The function of this 
ribozyme is analogous to the natural alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme (ADH) and depends 
also on the same cofactors. 10   Furthermore this ribozyme was coupled with an electron 
transfer process between NADH and FAD. Thus a NAD +  regeneration system is consti-
tuted. Interestingly, the reverse reaction, the RNA - catalysed reduction of the aldehyde, is 
also possible in presence of NADH.  24 This is the ﬁ rst clear - cut demonstration of a typical 
redox reaction catalysed by RNA. 
 Further artiﬁ cial ribozymes are known to react with cosubstrates, for example acylating 
the thiol group of tethered Co - enzyme A with the AMP - activated biotin. These ribozymes 
also produce the crucial metabolic intermediates acetyl - CoA and butyryl - CoA at substan-
tial reaction rates. For the selection of this ribozyme, the employed RNA pool had been 
coupled at its 5 ′  - end to CoA by a previously isolated capping ribozyme.  19 Ribozymes for 
a number of related reactions were isolated, and the reader is referred to an excellent 
review discussing in detail the current knowledge on ribozyme catalysis in the context of 
the RNA world hypothesis. 26 
 The current hypothesis predicts evolution of the RNA world into the modern DNA −
 RNA − protein world, thereby DNA taking over the storage of genomic information. One 
advantage of DNA over RNA as genetic material is the better chemical and enzymatic 
stability of deoxynucleic acids. That same advantage also comes to bear as a property 
of deoxyribozymes, of which a wide range has been selected by now. Despite this, there 
is little evidence that ribozymes from the RNA world might have been replaced by 
deoxyribozymes. Rather, proteins have taken over the vast majority of catalytic 
functions. 
 The intrinsically restricted functionality of nucleic acids as compared to proteins is a 
serious shortcoming for the expression of catalytic potential. A possible remedy is the 
introduction of additional, non - natural functional groups  via  the incorporation of modiﬁ ed 
nucleotides. 29   The tolerance of the employed RNA polymerase towards the modiﬁ cations 
limits the general use of this technique for the generation of modiﬁ ed ribozymes. Many 
such ribozymes with modiﬁ ed bases catalyse RNA cleavage or ligation. Further catalytic 
activities concern metalation of  N  - methylmesoporphyrin, formation of a phosphodiester 
bond with a deoxynucleotide, and cleavage of phosphodiester  in trans  under simulated 
physiological conditions. 
 The incorporation by T7 RNA polymerase and successful use in SELEX of a number 
of uridine derivatives was reported by Eaton ’ s laboratory, resulting in the development 
of a cupric ion - dependent modiﬁ ed ribozyme with Diels – Alderase activity. 13 To current 
knowledge, the Diels – Alder reaction does not play a major role in any biochemical 
pathway, and the use of modiﬁ ed nucleotides to expand the catalytic repertoire of RNA 
was certainly not undertaken with the RNA world as principal motivation. Rather, these 
approaches underscore the potential for application of catalytic RNA in modern ﬁ elds of 
biotechnology and organic synthesis. The use of proteic enzymes in organic synthesis has 
become a commonplace strategy where applicable, the limiting factor being the choice 
of suitable enzymes and their respective substrate speciﬁ cities. From this perspective, 
several ribozymes display catalytic activity of high interest to the organic chemist (see 
Table  14.2 ). Importantly, most of these ribozymes have been obtained using a direct 
selection protocol, where the choice of reactants has dictated the substrate speciﬁ city of 
the resulting ribozymes.

 Thus, the direct selection method holds the alluring possibility to engineer substrate -
 speciﬁ c ribozymes which are tailored to the particular reaction an organic chemist might 
wish to carry out. Since nucleic acids are chiral, one can even anticipate stereoselectivity 
in the would - be custom - made catalysts. Although this remains a vision yet to be accom-
plished, several cases of ribozymes with promising properties have been reported, accel-
erating certain redox reactions, Michael additions and cycloadditions. Already mentioned 
was the oxidation of a benzyl alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde, and the reverse 
reaction from Suga`s laboratory. The redox ribozymes still require their substrate to be 
covalently bound, meaning they act  in cis , thus performing neither true catalysis nor 
multiple turnover. 10 
 In the Famulok laboratory, a ribozyme was isolated which promotes a reaction corre-
sponding to the ﬁ rst step of the formation of dTMP from dUMP in proteic thymidylate 
synthases. This ribozyme mediates Michael - adduct formation at a Michael - acceptor sub-
strate. The reaction is accelerated by a factor of nearly 10 5 . The selected ribozyme could 
be engineered to act in an intermolecular reaction on a substrate tethered to an RNA 
oligomer. The demonstration of RNA catalysis of this reaction has bearings on the RNA 
world hypothesis, as well as implications for possible synthetic applications. 18 
 14.5  Deoxyribozymes  –  DNA Molecules with Catalytic Properties 
 While there is still no demonstration that DNA carries out catalytic functions in present -
 day biology, numerous DNAzymes have been developed by in vitro selection. While the 
spectrum is not as wide as for ribozymes, it clearly goes far beyond what was imagined 
a few years back (Table  14.3 ). 30 
 One class of deoxyribozymes has found routine practical applications in molecular 
biology. These are deoxyribozymes that cleave target RNAs in a highly predicable, 
sequence - speciﬁ c manner, thereby acting as designer nucleases. These DNAzymes gener-
ally utilize as nucleophile the 2 ′  - OH group on the RNA substrate adjacent to the phos-
phodiester bond to be cleaved and generate cleavage products with a 5 ′ - OH and a 
2 ′ ,3 ′ - cyclophosphate terminus, respectively, which can be easily processed by other 
enzymes.

 DNAzymes can also cleave DNA. This is, however, achieved by an oxidative mecha-
nism involving freely diffusible hydroxyl radicals. The site and sequence speciﬁ city of 
cleavage is low, limiting the synthetic utility of these enzymes. 
 Many DNAzymes catalyse RNA ligation reactions to yield linear, branched, and 
lariat - type reaction products. The ligation of DNA strands as well as the phosphoryla-
tion of DNA or RNA oligonucleotides was described. Some notable extensions beyond 
phosphodiester chemistry include a photoreversion reaction, a deglycosylation, porphyrin 
metalation, nucleopeptide bond formation, and ﬁ nally a Diels – Alder reaction. This latter 
reaction is essentially the same studied by the J ä schke lab with RNA as a catalyst (as 
discussed below in more detail), and the information published to - date indicates that 
the catalytic proﬁ ciency of DNA and RNA enzymes for Diels – Alder reactions is very 
similar. 
 Like in the case of RNA, DNAzymes were created with a variety of  ‘ side chains ’ , 
ranging from imidazol groups to primary amines and imidines. 31 
 14.6  Catalysis of  C − C Bond Formation by Diels – Alderase Ribozymes 
 In this last section, I will discuss structure and mechanism of one artiﬁ cial ribozyme in 
more detail. This ribozyme, selected in my laboratory, is the only RNA catalyst for small -
 molecule chemistry with a known spatial structure, and due to extensive studies, it is 
arguably the best - characterized artiﬁ cial ribozyme known to - date. These data provide for 
the ﬁ rst time an insight into how a small RNA can accelerate reactions different from 
phosphodiester chemistry, and what structural prerequisites are required. 
 14.6.1  In Vitro Selection 
 The selection started with an RNA library of  ∼ 2  ×  10 14  sequences of 160 nucleotide 
length. 11   After tethering the RNA to anthracene via long ﬂ exible PEG chains, this library 
was allowed to react for with an excess of biotinylated maleimide. Biotinylated RNA was 
recovered using immobilized strepavidin, and selection pressure was gradually increased 
by reducing reaction time and maleimide concentration. After 10 iterations of selection 
and ampliﬁ cation, the enriched library showed  ∼ 6,500 - fold rate acceleration, compared 
to the starting library. Individual members of this enriched library were sequenced and 
assayed for activity. 
 32 of the 35 catalytically active RNAs were found to share a common motif (Figure 
 14.3 ): Central element is an asymmetric internal bubble comprised of the two consensus 
sequences UGCCA and AAUACU, framed by two helices (helix II and III, light and dark 
gray, respectively). From helix II, another helix (helix I) continues in which one strand 
is formed by nucleotides from the conserved 5 ′  - primer binding site. In all sequences 
containing the motif, the 5 ′  - terminal GGAG is left (formally) unpaired. The ﬁ rst G is the 
site where the tethered anthracene is attached, suggesting an important structural role of 
this tetranucleotide. The respective ends of helix I and III are connected by loops L1 and 
L2 of varying size and sequence. A small 49 - mer RNA containing this motif only (with 
the ends of helix I and III closed by stabilizing tetranucleotide loops) accelerated the 
reaction between the tethered anthracene and biotin maleimide about 18,500 - fold, con-
ﬁ rming the ﬁ ndings of sequence analysis.  11   All characterization studies that follow have

been performed on the minimal 49 - mer derived from the conserved motif, or on variants 
of this minimal ribozyme. 
 14.6.2  Overall Catalytic Properties 
 The ribozymes were selected to catalyse the Diels – Alder reaction between a covalently 
tethered anthracene and a biotinylated maleimide, which is a single - turnover format. 
However, the selected Diels – Alderase ribozymes and the minimal 49 - mer could be 
shown to accelerate C − C bond formation in a true bimolecular fashion ( in trans reac-
tion, Figure  14.4 ). 42   Substrate molecules as small as 9 - hydroxymethylanthracene and 
N - ethylmaleimide are speciﬁ cally recognized by the ribozymes, followed by conversion 
to the respective Diels – Alder products and product dissociation from the catalyst. The 
49 - mer ribozyme performs the reaction with fast multiple turnovers, and a k cat of 21  min  − 1 
was measured. Saturation type kinetics with respect to both reactants (K M,Diene  =  370  µ M, 
K M,Dienophile    =   8   mM) as well as product inhibition were observed. The  ‘ effective molar-
ity ’  as a measure for the entropic gain of the ribozyme - catalysed reaction was determined 
from the ratio k cat /k uncat  to be 6.6   M, giving a lower estimate for the rate acceleration of 
1,100 - fold. 42 
 Another characteristic feature of enzymatic catalysis was demonstrated for the Diels –
 Alderase ribozymes, namely enantioselective bond formation. While the uncatalysed

reaction produces racemic product mixtures, the ribozyme - catalysed conversion shows 
an enantioselectivity of over 95%  ee . The enantioselectivity was shown to be primarily 
dependent on the size of the substituent at the anthracene ring system, and the enantiomer 
of this ribozyme (chemically synthesized from the unnatural L - ribonucleotides) showed 
the opposite stereoselectivity (Figure  14.4 ). 42 
 14.6.3  Overall Structure of the Ribozyme 
 The three - dimensional structure of the Diels – Alderase ribozyme could be solved both in 
form of the Apo - enzyme and in complex with the Diels – Alder cycloaddition product.  43 
The molecule adopts an overall topology that resembles the greek letter lambda   λ (Figure 
 14.5 ), featuring a special kind of three - way junction. Stems II and III are co - linearly 
stacked (best seen in panel b), bridged by a zippered - up asymmetric bubble, while stem 
I is extended by two base pairs and branches off at the bubble at  ∼ 60  °  angle. In the centre 
of the molecule there is extra electron density that is not related to nucleotides and can 
be traced back to the  S ,  S  stereoisomer of the Diels – Alder product, tightly bound into a 
pocked as a single, well - deﬁ ned conformer (Figure  14.5 c). 
 The 5 ′  - GGAG tetranucleotide plays a critical role in shaping both the RNA scaffold 
and the catalytic pocket. G1 and G2 form Watson - Crick pairs with C11 and C10, while 
A3 and G4 pair with U20 and C19, thereby generating the nested pseudoknot topology 
within the RNA scaffold (dotted lines in Figure  14.5 A,  14.5 B).  ‘ Pseudoknot ’  denotes a 
secondary structure resulting from nucleotides in the loop of an RNA stem - loop structure 
with nucleotides outside of the stem - loop. The 5 ′  - terminal GGAG serves to clamp together 
the opposite sites of the asymmetric internal bubble, and the direct connection of four 
helices without interjecting spacers can impose severe strain on the system. Such an

(bottom), the U 17 • (G 2 • C 10 ) triple (upper right), and the U 8 • A 18 reverse Hoogsteen pair (left, 
Figure  14.6 ), and is lined by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds (dotted lines). The 
(former) maleimide ring is stacked over C 10 , and apparently oriented through a pair of 
hydrogen bonds involving one of its two carbonyl oxygens, while its side chain runs inside 
a hydrophobic canyon. One of the aromatic rings of the Diels – Alder product is sand-
wiched between purines G 2 and A 3 , while the other is wedged between the base and sugar 
components of A 18  and U 20  (Figure  14.5 ). The catalytic pocket, which is primarily formed 
by base edges with minimal contribution by the sugar - phosphate backbone, is accessible 
to the product from the front while a narrow oriﬁ ce is visible in the back. It should be 
noted that the catalytic pocket contains not only a cavity to accommodate the cycloaddi-
tion product but also a direction - speciﬁ c surface channel to accommodate the maleimide 
side chain, which provides a convenient explanation for the observed stereoselectivity. 
There are no Mg 2+  cations positioned within the immediate vicinity of the pocket that 
could participate in the catalytic process. 
 The structure of the free Diels – Alderase ribozyme was found to be virtually identical 
to the structure of the product complex, providing strong support for the concept of a 
preformed catalytic pocket, established by chemical probing. 44 The anthracene - RNA 
conjugate could also be crystallized, however, the anthracene module and its linker were 
found to be disordered in the crystal. The RNA mapped well with the other crystal 
structures.

 14.6.5  Interactions Between the Ribozyme and its Substrates and Products 
 The crystallographic information about the architecture of the catalytic pocket could be 
compared with an earlier study that elucidated the interactions of the ribozyme with its 
substrates and products by chemical substitution analysis using 44 different, systemati-
cally varied analogues.  45   In that study, RNA - diene interaction was found to be governed 
by stacking interactions, while hydrogen bonding and metal ion coordination appeared to 
be less important. The diene has to be an anthracene derivative, and substituents at deﬁ ned 
positions are permitted, thereby shedding light on the geometry of the binding site (Figure 
 14.7 ). The crystal structure shows that there in no space to accommodate substituents at 
positions 2, 3, 6 and 7 (shown in outline letters), as these would clash into the walls of 
the catalytic pocket. Some space for small substituents is found at positions 4, 5 and 10, 
pointing towards the back of the pocket. Large substituents are tolerated at positions 1, 
8, and 9, pointing out of the pocket. Interestingly, the polyethylene glycol tether used in 
the selection does not make any contribution to binding and can be removed or shifted 
to another position (e.g., position 1) without penalty. 
 The dienophile must be a ﬁ ve - membered maleimidyl ring with an unsubstituted reac-
tive double bond. Substituents would again collide with the walls of the catalytic pocket. 
A hydrophobic side chain (alkyl or aryl) makes a major contribution to RNA binding. 
Branching is not allowed at the alpha position (next to the maleimide ring), due to steric 
clash with the walls. The ribozyme distinguishes between different enantiomers of chiral 
substrates and accelerates cycloadditions with both enantio -  and diastereoselectivity.

Molecular Encapsulation
The stereochemistry of the reaction is controlled by RNA - diene interactions. The 
RNA interacts strongly and stereoselectively with the cycloaddition products, requiring 
several structural features to be present. Strong and stereoselective product inhibition is 
observed. 45 
 The crystal structure shows three H - bonds between the reaction product and RNA. One 
that involves an ether oxygen of the polyethylene glycol tether is irrelevant for catalysis 
as the tether can be removed entirely without effect on catalysis. The other two involve 
the maleimide ’ s carbonyl oxygen and could be mechanistically meaningful. The impor-
tance of these bonds is, however, not yet completely established, and atomic mutagenesis 
is currently used to probe these interactions.  
 14.6.6  Conformational Dynamics and the Roles of Metal Ions 
 The investigation of this ribozyme ’ s kinetics, reaction mechanism and folding by con-
ventional chemical and biochemical methods revealed quite early complex relationships 
and suggested the existence of various conformational forms of this RNA molecule. 
Single - molecule ﬂ uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were carried 
out using dye - labeled ribozyme molecules.  46   The results show that the DAse ribozyme 
possesses three structurally different states that are distinguishable by their FRET efﬁ -
ciency distributions, the unfolded (U), intermediate (I) and folded (F) states. Mg 2+ titration 
allowed to measure changes in their equilibrium populations and to observe the collapse 
of the intermediate state. Both effects were described with a thermodynamic model, 
revealing how the F state is stabilized by successive binding of Mg 2+  ions. Furthermore, 
continuous ﬂ uctuations were observed between the I and F states on the 100   ms 
timescale. 
 To further elucidate the interactions of the Diels – Alderase ribozyme with divalent 
metal ions in solution, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was applied 
using paramagnetic manganese instead of magnesium ions.  47   Manganese ion titrations 
revealed ﬁ ve high - afﬁ nity Mn 2+  binding sites with an upper K d of 0.6  µ M. In order to 
characterize each binding site individually, EPR - silent Cd 2+  ions were used to saturate 
the other binding sites. This cadmium - induced EPR silencing showed that the Mn 2+ 
binding sites possess different afﬁ nities. In addition, these binding sites could be assigned 
to three different types, including innersphere, outersphere, and a Mn 2+ dimer.

 14.6.7  Mechanistic Considerations 
 The X - ray crystal structure of the ribozyme - product complex,  43   coupled with chemical  45 
and biochemical  44   experiments, suggests that the ribozyme should bind the diene and 
dienophile in a precisely deﬁ ned steric orientation within a wedge - shaped catalytic pocket, 
thereby facilitating the reaction by reducing translational and rotational degrees of 
freedom. The anthracene substrate could be bound by stacking interactions between G2 
and the A3 - U20 pair. The reaction requires that the maleimide substrate be stacked on 
top of the anthracene, and parallel to it, at a distance of about 3.5  Å . In this position, 
maleimide can form hydrogen bonds between its carbonyl - oxygen and the exocyclic 
amino group of G9 and the 2 ′  - OH of U17. The N - alkyl side chain can be placed within 
the hydrophobic canyon (Figure  14.8 ), which would allow the approach of the maleimide 
to the bound anthracene only from one direction, thereby providing the stereoselectivity 
of the reaction. In the transition state of the reaction, two new single - bonds are partly 
formed (bond lengths  ∼ 2.2  Å ), and the anthracene ring system is bent out of planarity to

yield an angle of about 154    ° (Figure  14.8 ), therefore further reducing the minimal unoc-
cupied space underneath the bridgehead carbons seen in the structure of the ribozyme -
 product complex. Remarkably, the transition state has near - perfect shape complementarity 
with the catalytic pocket, a feature of prime importance in antibody catalysis of the 
Diels – Alder reactions. 48,49   In addition to steric factors, both stacking and hydrogen 
bonding may contribute the energetics of the reaction. Stacking of the anthracene with 
nucleotides A3 and U20 could accelerate the reaction by increasing the diene ’ s electron 
density, while hydrogen bonding of the maleimide would make it more electron - deﬁ cient, 
thereby increasing catalytic reactivity. Thus, it appears that ribozyme - based catalysis of 
Diels – Alder reactions reﬂ ects a combination of proximity, shape complementarity, and 
energetic contributions to the catalytic process. 
 The catalytic parameters of the Diels – Alderase ribozymes were analyzed by Houk 
and coworkers and were found to compare favorably with those of catalytic Diels –
 Alderase antibodies, cyclodextrins, and synthetic capsules.  50   From the measured param-
eters, these authors concluded that most of the rate acceleration arises from the conversion 
of a second - order reaction of diene and dienophile into a ﬁ rst - order reaction of the 
termolecular complex ribozyme, diene, and dienophile, and calculated an extra transi-
tion state stabilization (relative to the ground state) of only  − 1.1  kcal  mol  − 1 , which is 
an order of magnitude lower than typical values for natural (protein) enzymes. 
Computational analysis of the ribozyme - catalysed Diels – Alder reaction by Zhang and 
Bruice using QM/MM methods conﬁ rmed the concerted nature of the cycloaddition 
and found that the proﬁ ciency of the RNA - catalysed reaction originates from the active 
site holding the two reactants in reactive conformations, in which the reacting atoms 
are brought together in van der Waals distances and reactants approach each other at 
an appropriate angle.  51 
 14.7  Conclusion 
 Despite their limited set of functional groups, ribozymes can accelerate complex organic 
transformations like Diels – Alder reactions between small molecules in a way similar to 
protein enzymes or supramolecular catalysts featuring multiple turnover, substrate 
speciﬁ city and stereoselectivity. The three - dimensional structure shows striking similari-
ties with proteins evolved for similar reactions, and the catalytic strategies used appear 
to be similar as well.

 15.1  Introduction 
 The catalysis of reactions in organized media is of current interest.  1 – 5 The compartmen-
talization of reagents within nanosized aggregates results in a sharp increase in their local 
concentrations (the concentration factor) and affects their microenvironment (the micro-
environment factor), thereby inﬂ uencing their reactivity. Since 1980 we have been study-
ing nucleophilic substitution at phosphorus and carbon in organized solutions based on 
surfactants. The transfer of phosphoryl and carbonyl groups is one of the most fundamen-
tal chemical and biochemical reactions.  6   Phosphorus acid esters are compounds with 
interesting biological and pharmacological properties and are widely used as pesticides, 
drugs, and nerve gases.  7   Their accumulation and their impact on the environment are of 
paramount importance, therefore chemical decontamination of toxic compounds is of 
increasing interest. 
 At ﬁ rst, the catalytic effect of the single micellar solutions based on surfactants of dif-
ferent structure was studied. The data covering this period are reviewed in refs.  8,9 The 
regularities when generalized made it possible to proceed with the more complicated 
systems, in particular, the binary surfactant solutions, the polymer - surfactant and

since they can cover ensembles of different morphology formed through diverse noncova-
lent interactions of both intra -  and intermolecular nature, as well as through inclusion 
interactions involving the cyclophane cavity. In these systems structural transitions 
induced by changes in solution conditions (concentration, temperature, ionic force, pH, 
and etc.) are observed. Along with the above factors of concentration and microenviron-
ment these structural transitions can affect the reaction rate. Therefore the investigation 
of the catalytic effect of the polycomponent systems requires knowledge of the structural 
behaviour of the systems, in particular, packing modes, morphology of aggregates, surface 
potential, etc. 
 15.2  The Single Micellar Systems: Factors of Concentration and 
Micellar Microenvironment 
 The physico - chemical fundamentals of micellar catalysis and quantitative evaluation of 
basic factors responsible for rate alteration in organized media were developed by Berezin 
et al.  1,10   Within the frame of pseudo phase approach, the micellar solution is assumed to 
consist of micellar and bulk pseudo phases, with reagents partitioned between them. In 
general, reaction occurs in both pseudo phases simultaneously. For the case of bimolecu-
lar reactions the observed rate constant can be expressed as follows:

where   ′
kobs is the second order rate constant obtained by the division of the observed 
pseudo ﬁ rst rate constant (k obs ) by the total nucleophile concentration; k 2,0  is the second 
order rate constant of the reaction in the water; k m (=  k 2,m /V) represents the reactivity 
in the micellar phase where the reaction occurs; K s  and K Nu  are binding constants of 
substrate and nucleophile; C is the total surfactant concentration minus the critical 
micelle concentration (cmc) of the surfactant mixture. The approach developed by 
Berezin makes it possible to differentiate the factors responsible for the micellar effects, 
i.e. the micellar microenvironment factor (F m ) and the factor of the concentrating of 
reagents in micelles (F c ). 
 Different modiﬁ cations of the pseudo phase model and their applications for quantita-
tive treatment of kinetics of bimolecular reactions are reviewed by Bunton and Romsted.  2,3 
A wide variety of ion - molecular reactions has been covered in these comprehensive 
reviews, and a generalization was drawn on the prevalent contribution of the concentrating 
of reagents to the rate effect and negative inﬂ uence of micellar microenvironment on 
reactivity. Our systematic investigations of the kinetics of basic hydrolyses of phosphorus 
acid esters in aqueous and organic solutions of ionic surfactants of different structure 
showed that the above tendency of a decrease in the reactivity on the transfer of the reac-
tion from the bulk pseudo phase to the micellar interior is only typical for the systems 
with effective binding of reagents. In fact, this is observed for the reactions involving 
hydrophobic compounds and occurring in aqueous solutions of surfactants with effective 
micellization capacity. In this case, the k obs – [surfactant] kinetic dependences demonstrate 
a marked maximum. Most kinetic data reviewed in ref.  2,3   are related to these systems. 
Indeed, investigations of the basic hydrolyses of phosphonates  1 – 11 (Scheme  15.1 ) in

aqueous solutions of cationic surfactants, in particular cetyltrimethylammonium bromide 
(CTAB) 11   and cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB)  12   have revealed that the factor of concen-
tration reached two orders of magnitude, while the transfer of the reaction to the micellar 
microenvironment resulted in a marked decrease in the reactivity of the phosphonates 
(Table  15.1 ). 
 The transfer from CTAB and CPB (cmc 0.00085   M) to dodecylpyridinium bromide 
(DDPB; cmc 0.018   M) results in a marked increase in the F m  value for substrate  1 , fol-
lowed by changes from the extremum type of kinetic dependences to S - shaped curves.  11 
While in the case of the more hydrophobic substrate  3  in the DDPB micellar solution, 
the maximum type kinetic curve and the negative effect of the micellar microenvironment 
(F m  <  1) are preserved (Table  15.1 ). 
 The investigation of the kinetics of the solvolysis of  p - nitrophenyl bis(chloromethyl)
phosphinate  12  in the direct micelles of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) in ethylene glycol 
have demonstrated that the ratio of the factors F c  and F m  in this system differ from that 
in aqueous micelles, namely, the positive predominant contribution of the factor of micro-
environment to the micellar rate effect is observed (Table  15.1 ).  13   In the solution of 
ethylene glycol the micellization is much less effective as compared to the aqueous solu-
tion (cmc of SDS in ethylene glycol is equal to 0.18   M, while in water it is 0.0085   M) 
and the micelles formed have low aggregation numbers, a loose structure and a weak 
solubilization capacity (the binding constants of substrates are lower by two orders of 
magnitude as compared to those in aqueous micellar solutions). 13 
 The tendency of decreasing the contribution of the concentration factor and increasing 
the contribution of the factor of the micellar microenvironment is also observed for the 
reverse nonaqueous micellar solutions. For the case of aminolysis of phosphonates  1 – 4 
in the polyethylene glycol - 600 - monolaurate (PM) reverse micelles, both factors are 
shown to contribute positively to the micellar rate effect, with F m  higher than F c (Table 
 15.1 ). 14,15   In nonaqueous systems micellization is mainly contributed by dispersion inter-
actions and results in the formation of small aggregates with a low solubilization capacity 
towards the substrates. 16 
 In work, 11   the mechanism of the alteration of the reactivity in direct micelles is inves-
tigated. The kinetics of hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3  in the DDPB micellar solution 
is measured at different temperatures and the activation parameters of the reaction, the 
enthalpy of activation and the entropy of activation in water in the absence of a surfactant 
( ∆H0
≠,   ∆S0
≠) and in the micellar pseudo phase (  ∆H0
≠,   ∆S0
≠) are estimated. The transfer of 
the ion - molecular reactions from water to the less polar pseudo phase is shown to result 
in some decrease in the enthalpy of activation (from 46.2 to 39. 3   kJ   mol  − 1  for  1  and from 
40.8 to 30.0  kJ  mol  − 1  for  3 ). This is in line with the Ingold – Hughes principle postulating

that a decrease in the polarity, in particular on transfer from water to the micellar micro-
environment should favour ion - molecular reactions since they are characterized by some 
delocalization of the charge in the transition state as compared to the initial state. 
Concurrently the transfer from the dilute aqueous solution of reagents to the concentrated 
micellar pseudo phase is followed by a decrease in the entropy of activation by 
22.0  J  mol  − 1  K  − 1  for  1 and by 45.6  J  mol  − 1  K  − 1  for  3 , which is probably due to losses in the 
entropy of mixing, the decrease in the degree of the freedom of reagents, and the altera-
tion of their orientation. In the case of substrate  1 , changes in enthalpy and entropy of 
activation compensate each other, so that the reactivity is practically identical in both 
pseudo - phases (F m    =   1, Table  15.1 ). An increase in the concentration effect for substrate 
 3  results in greater losses in the entropy of activation exceeding the gain in the enthalpy 
of activation, which is expressed in the apparent failure of the Ingold – Hughes principle 
(F m  <    1, Table  15.1 ). Therefore, one can conclude that the reactivity in the micellar 
systems is controlled by changes in the entropy of activation on the transfer of the reac-
tion from the bulk solution to the micellar interior.  
 15.3  The Role of the Structural Factor in Supramolecular 
Catalytic Systems 
 15.3.1  The Inﬂ uence of the  ‘ Sphere – Rod ’ Micellar Transition on the Reactivity 
 The addition of electrolytes to the ionic micellar systems decreases the surface potential 
of micelles thereby decreasing the catalytic effect.  1 – 3,8,9   Besides such  ‘ trivial ’ inhibition, 
electrolytes may exert an indirect inﬂ uence on the reaction rate in micellar systems. At a 
certain concentration of counterions there occurs the  ‘ sphere – rod ’  micellar transition, 
which is analytically indicated by the break in the  ‘ property ’  versus  ‘ logarithm of the 
counterion concentration ’ plot (Figure  15.1 ) 17 – 19  . Changes in the structural characteristics 
as a result of this transition may also affect the reactivity of compounds in micelles. To 
verify this assumption, the catalytic properties in parallel with the structural behaviour 
are studied for the DDPB micelles in the presence of sodium salicylate.  19 The treatment 
of the kinetic data of basic hydrolysis of  1  in semi - logarithmic coordinates provides the 
critical concentration of sodium salicylate (NaSal)  ∼ 0.05  M deﬁ ned as a break point in 
the  k obs  –  lg C Sal  plot. The size and shape of the micelles are estimated by the methods of 
 1 H NMR spectroscopy based on the self - diffusion coefﬁ cients of DDPB and EPR spec-
troscopy based on the correlation time of spin - label rotation. Near the concentration of 
0.05   M a change is shown to occur from a spherical to a rod - like shape of aggregates.  19 
This provides evidence for the correlation between the above break points on the kinetic 
plot and the micellar  ‘ sphere – rod ’  transitions, and hence, for the inﬂ uence of these struc-
tural rearrangements on the reactivity. This approach is used for the treatment of the salt 
effect on the structural behaviour and catalytic effect of the conventional cationic sur-
factants CTAB and CPB, as well as gemini cationic surfactants and the hydroxyalkylated 
single - head cationic surfactants. 18,20,21

 For reverse micellar systems, the phenomenon of electrical percolation is observed. This 
is manifested by the sharp increase in the conductivity of the systems by three - four

orders of magnitude with an increase in the temperature or in volume fraction of the 
dispersed phase.  22 In works, 23 – 25 the inﬂ uence of this phenomenon on the reactivity of 
 1 in the sodium bis(2 - ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) - n - alkane - water reverse micellar 
system was studied with different parameters Z   =   [alkane]/[AOT] (mol) and W = [H 2 O]/
[AOT] (mol) (Figure  15.2 ). Based on the data of the conductivity of solutions, the values 
of the temperature of the percolation threshold are estimated and the experimental condi-
tions for the kinetic runs below and above the temperature induced percolation are 
chosen. 
 Unlike aqueous solutions, a typical Arrhenius dependence for the reverse systems is 
maintained only before a certain critical temperature (T cr ), while above this temperature 
a decrease in  k obs  occurs with temperature. The value of T cr  is found to coincide with the 
percolation threshold temperature. 24 We assume that the same temperature induced struc-
tural changes of the reverse micelles are responsible for the clustering of the reverse

micelles as well as for the change in the slope of the Arrhenius plot. Probably, the above 
structural changes can be accompanied by the alteration in the properties of the micellar 
microenvironment of reagents, such as micropolarity, the surface potential, and etc., 
which can affect the reactivity. The investigation of the absorption spectra of substrate  1 
and the products of its hydrolysis validated that the relocation of these compounds towards 
the less polar microenvironment occurred above the percolation threshold. Granting this, 
the effect of the temperature on the chemical kinetics in the reverse micellar systems can 
be divided into two contributions. One is responsible for the standard temperature activa-
tion of chemical processes, while the other accounts for the change in the localization of 
reagents and their partition between phases due to modiﬁ cation of the properties of aggre-
gates. The typical trend of the Arrhenius dependence below the percolation threshold T cr 
(Figure  15.2 ) provides evidence that the ﬁ rst contribution is prevalent. In this case the 
slope of the lg  k obs  vs . 1/T plot is determined by the energy of the activation (E a ) of basic 
hydrolysis of  1 . Above the T cr  value the competitive tendency is probably predominant. 
Therefore the trend of the Arrhenius dependence is determined by the change in the local

properties of the microenvironment of reagents with temperature. In this range, a decrease 
in  k obs occurs with temperature. 
 15.3.3  The Hydrolysis of Carbonic Acid Esters in Microemulsions under 
Phase Inversion Conditions 
 Microemulsions with high surfactant concentrations provide a wide - range variation in the 
component ratio, which can result in essential changes in their structural behaviour and 
properties, in rearrangements of the interface, and in phase inversions. As a result, transi-
tions become possible between three different phases: (i) reverse microemulsions (water/
oil; w/o) composed of water microdroplets dispersed in a continuous oil phase and sta-
bilized by the surfactant monolayer including a co - surfactant if necessary; (ii) bicontinu-
ous systems with both water and oil as continuous phases and surfactant molecules 
intertwined in a three - dimensional network; (iii) direct microemulsions (oil/water; o/w) 
composed of the oil microdroplets dispersed in a continuous aqueous phase. 26 
 Basic hydrolyses of  p - nitrophenyl acetate  13  and laurate  14  are studied in the CTAB/
butanol/hexane/water system under the phase transitions induced by changes in the water/
oil ratio.  27 – 30   The structural behaviour of the systems is examined by methods of conduc-
tometry, NMR self - diffusion, EPR spine probe spectroscopy, UV - Vis solvatochromic 
probe E T (30) spectroscopy. This makes it possible to characterize some micro -  and mac-
roscopic properties of the systems and to deﬁ ne the points of phase transitions in the series 
w/o - bicontinuous - o/w microemulsions. The dependence of the observed rate constant on 
the volume fraction of water in microemulsions also demonstrated three different regions 
with boundaries coinciding with the above structural transitions in the systems.  28 The 
character of the  k obs  vs .  ‘ water fraction ’  dependence is mainly inﬂ uenced by the local 
medium polarity and the activity of hydroxide - ions. In the w/o microemulsion at low 
water content, the bound water (hydrated water) is predominantly present in the micellar 
core. When the water core increases, there appears the bulk water with a higher polarity, 
which favors the dissociation processes and increases the activity of hydroxide ions. This 
results in the increase in the  k obs  value. In a bicontinuous system an increase in  k obs  is less 
pronounced, since the aqueous phase is concentrated in narrow channels thereby prevent-
ing the growth of the volume fraction of water. Besides, the considerable increase in 
microviscosity also contributes to the observed rate constants of the hydrolysis as a dif-
fusion term. Further, the transition  ‘ bicontinuous  – o/w ’  system results once again in a 
sharp increase in the reaction rate with the dispersion phase volume. Water is assumed 
to regulate the partition of butanol between phases, retaining constant its concentration 
in the dispersion phase, which is supported by the data of NMR self - diffusion. 27 This 
decreases the content of butanol at the interface increasing the positive charge density of 
aggregates and the surface concentration of hydroxide - ions.

ing a wide range of hydrophilic - lipophilic balance and micellizating properties (cmc of 
the surfactants above are equal to 0.000017, 0.00031, 0.000052, 0.00022  M). 
 The micellization of binary surfactant solutions is studied by the method of tensiometry 
at the variation of the fraction of ionic surfactant   α 1  within the range 0 – 1.0. The quantita-
tive treatment of the surface tension isotherms within the framework of the phase separa-
tion model  36   showed that the values of the interaction parameter   β  in these systems lay 
within the range ( − 0.85) – ( − 4.6). This indicates that in these systems synergetic behaviour 
occurs, i.e. the mixed aggregates are formed. The surface potential is calculated for all 
the systems. A decrease in the potential is shown to occur with a decrease in   α 1 . 31,32,34 In 
the single CTAB micelles, up to a 20 - fold acceleration of the hydrolysis of  1  is observed. 
The nonionic Brij - 97 31 and C 14 E 9 34   micelles do not inﬂ uence the reaction rate, while the 
Brij - 35 35 and Triton - X - 100 33 micelles retard the reaction by 3 – 5 times. 
 Figure  15.3 shows that a decrease in the fraction of ionic surfactant   α 1 results in a 
decrease in the catalytic effect. In the case of the Brij - 35 and Triton - X - 100 micelles

an inversion from the catalysis to the inhibition of the processes occurs. At a certain 
concentration of Brij - 35 in the mixture actually an absolute termination of the reaction 
is observed. The elucidation of the main factors responsible for the alteration of the 
reaction rate in micelles, i.e. the factor of concentration (F c ) and the factor of micro-
environment (F m ) (Table 1, the data are exempliﬁ ed by the CTAB/C 14 E 9 system 34 ) makes 
it possible to derive the driving force of the catalysis in binary systems. The compensa-
tory change of the F c  and F m  values occurs within the whole range of the surfactant 
ratio. However, with small additives of nonionic surfactants, an increase in the factor 
of the micellar microenvironment is a prevalent tendency, controlling the increase of 
the resulting catalytic effect. Further decrease in   α 1  results in the inversion of the trend, 
so that an increase in F c  is accompanied by a decrease in F m  (Table  15.1 ). In these 
surfactant mixtures, the contribution of the negative inﬂ uence of the factor of micellar 
microenvironment remains dominating, which provides reasons for the reduction of the 
catalytic efﬁ ciency. Thus, the catalytic effect of the binary surfactant systems is deter-
mined by the tendency of changing the factor of micellar microenvironment throughout 
the 
whole 
surfactant 
proportions. 
This 
indicates 
that 
unlike 
surfactant - 
electrolyte systems,  17 – 19   the surface potential controlling the concentration factor plays 
only an auxiliary role in mixed micelles.

 methylthio) - 6 - methylpyrimidin - 4 - yl)hexamethylenediamine with phosphinate  12  in chlo-
roform is studied. The formation of the CTAB − PM mixed aggregates is proved by the 
NMR self - diffusion, by dielcometric titration, and by dynamic light scattering.  37,39 The 
micellar catalytic effect is shown to change with the size of macrocycle in the series PPh -

 15.5  Polycomponent Catalytic Systems Based on Amphiphiles 
and Polymers 
 15.5.1  The Conventional Surfactant/Polyethyleneimine Systems 
 Since the self - organized catalytic systems are considered to be the simplest models of 
enzyme catalysts,  1 – 3   we made an effort to model one of the basic principles of biocatalysis, 
namely, the polyfunctional mechanism of the enzyme action. Therefore, the main idea is 
to design the polycomponent catalytic ensembles by including ingredients with their own 
catalytic, sorption or solubilizing activities. For this purpose the step - by - step complication 
of supramolecular systems is carried out beginning with the aqueous polyethyleneimine 
(PEI) solution. The components of supramolecular systems were chosen in accordance 
with the following: PEI is known to accelerate the hydrolysis of phosphorus acid esters 
via the general basic catalysis.  40   Besides, it contributes to the catalysis of the reaction due 
to the sorption of reagents and to the formation of the catalytic complex substrate - 
polymer. The addition of a surfactant or other self - assembling amphiphiles to the systems 
opens up additional opportunities for binding the reagent due to the solubilization mecha-
nism together with the sorption pattern. The modiﬁ cation of the system with metal ions 
makes possible the contribution of the electrophilic catalysis to the catalytic mechanism, 
since a considerable acceleration of nucleophilic substitution at phosphorus by metal ions 
is well known. 6,41 
 15.5.1.1  The Single  PEI Solution 
 There is much evidence that the amines including polyamines accelerate hydrolyses of 
phosphorus acid esters via the general basic catalysis.  40,42   In the unbuffered solution, a 
small amount of protonated amino groups are present in the PEI molecules ( < 0.5 – 5.0% 
depending on the PEI molecular mass  43  ; PEI with the molecular mass from 800 (PEI - 800) 
to 60000 (PEI - 60) were studied). This means that under these conditions PEIs behave as 
neutral polymers rather than polyelectrolytes. The pH kinetic proﬁ le demonstrates that 
up to pH 9.2 the observed rate constant of hydrolyses of  1  and  3  in 0.05   M solution of 
PEI - 50 does not exceed the limits of 5    ×  10  − 5 s  − 1 , while a further increase in the pH results 
in a  ca . tenfold increase in the hydrolysis rate of both phosphonates.  43 This pH depend-
ence is rather typical and reﬂ ects the growth of the rate constant in the ﬁ eld of accumula-
tion of catalytic species, namely nonprotonated amino groups. In addition, the contribution 
of basic hydrolysis to  k obs values at high pH should also be taken into account. 
 To elucidate the inﬂ uence of the molecular mass of the polymer on reactivity, the 
kinetics of the hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3  was measured in the presence of 
ethylenediamine (ED), tetraethylenetetramine (TETA), PEI - 800, PEI - 25, and PEI - 50 at 
spontaneous solution pH equal to 10.0 – 10.8 depending on the molecular mass of the 
PEI. 43   For all the systems studied, an increase in  k obs  with the amine concentration occurs 
due to general basic catalysis. Starting from TETA the curves are S - shaped, which is in 
line with the preliminary equilibrium process such as the formation of the catalytic 
complex substrate - polymer. Therefore, the reagent binding by oligomerous and polymeric 
amines provides an additional contribution to the rate effect. An increase in molecular 
mass of amines results in a slight increase in the catalytic effect per amino group. The 
nature of substrate does not strongly affect the reactivity. Some higher  k obs  values were 
found for the less hydrophobic phosphonate  1 .

 15.5.1.2  The  SDS / PEI Supramolecular Systems 
 In works, 43,44   the self - organization is studied in the binary SDS/PEI systems by methods 
of tensiometry, conductometry, viscosimetry, potentiometry and dynamic light scattering. 
A marked decrease in cmc is observed when transferred from the single SDS solution 
(cmc 0.0085   M) to the SDS/PEI system (critical aggregation concentration (cac) 
0.00065  M, the data for PEI - 25 43 ), which provides evidence for the formation of the 
mixed surfactant - polymer ensembles. In the SDS/PEI - 30 systems the kinetics of hydro-
lyses of phosphonates  1 ,  3 ,  5  is studied under the variation of the molecular mass of 
polymer. 44   The acceleration of the reactions is observed as compared to the aqueous 
PEI solution. The reactivity of substrates decreases in the series  1  >  3  >  5 . The same 
tendency occurs in the alkali water solution and in the single PEI system. The  k obs  vs . 
[SDS] kinetic curves demonstrate an extreme type dependence unlike those in single 
PEI solutions. The kinetic curves with a maximum are typical for micellar catalysis 
and indicate the essential contribution of the solubilization pattern to the mechanism 
of reagent binding together with the sorption pattern involved in the single PEI solution. 
In the SDS/PEI system the higher reactivity is observed for the less hydrophobic sub-
strate  1  as compared to  3 . The rate effect is shown to be due to concentrating the 
reagents in the polymer - colloid complexes for all the systems studied (Table  15.1 ). To 
elucidate the structuring role of PEI and contribution of the polymer catalysis to the 
summary rate effect, the kinetics of the hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3  was exam-
ined in the micellar SDS solution in the presence of ED. In this case, a more than 
2 - fold retardation of the reaction occurs. Such a difference in the catalytic effect of 
monomeric and polymeric amines supports the above assumption that both the general 
basic catalysis and binding the substrates by the PEI molecules contribute to the accel-
eration of the reaction. 
 For substrate  1  the kinetics of hydrolysis is measured in the SDS/PEI - 30 system at 
different temperatures,  44   and then the activation parameters for the reaction in different 
pseudo phases are calculated. For micellar pseudo - phase the enthalpy of activation

 are calculated, 
which are in agreement with the bimolecular mechanism of the reaction. These values

). This probably provides evidence 
that the mechanism of catalysis remains unchanged when the process is transferred from 
water to aggregates, i.e. the general basic catalysis occurs in both cases. 
 The next stage of the study was on the kinetics of hydrolyses of  1 ,  3 and di - p - 
nitrophenyl phosphate  15  in the ternary SDS/PEI/La(III) system at spontaneous solution 
pH (pH  ≈ 8.7). 43   In this system there occurs a high performance in the reactivity of phos-
phonates and its growth. The maximum catalytic effect exceeding four orders of magni-
tude is found for the substrate  15  as compared to the single PEI solution. Comparison 
with the basic hydrolysis of  15 reveals the rate effect over six orders of magnitude. 
 15.5.1.3  The NonIonic - Surfactant/ PEI System 
 Unlike the SDS/PEI system the cmc value does not decrease markedly in the solutions 
of nonionic surfactant C 12 E 10  and Triton - X - 100 when the polymer is added. This is in line 
with the assumption on the weak afﬁ nity between the nonionic surfactant and polymers.  45

surfactant/PEI aggregation does take place. In work,  46 a step - by - step investigation of the 
aggregation and catalytic effect towards the cleavage of phosphorus acid esters  1  and  3 
has been performed in the following series: the single nonionic surfactant micelles    →  the 
binary nonionic surfactant/PEI micellar system    →    the ternary nonionic surfactant/PEI/
La(III) micellar system. The single C 12 E 10  micelles do not inﬂ uence the hydrolysis rate, 
while Triton - X - 100 solutions slightly retard the reaction.  33   In the binary nonionic/PEI 
solutions there occurs the rate enhancement of hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3 . For 
example, in the C 12 E 10 /PEI - 60 system 3.6 - fold and 4.7 - fold accelerations of the hydrolyses 
of  1  and  3  respectively occur as compared to the single PEI solution (Figure  15.4 a). When 
the low molecular mass amines are used instead of PEI, the  k obs  versus  surfactant concen-
tration dependence assume quite a different shape (Figure  15.4 b). Thus, provided that 
there occurs only the general basic catalysis of the hydrolysis of the phosphonates due to 
aminogroups of PEI, the inhibition of the reaction might be observed. These data provide 
evidence for the formation of a new type of aggregates as compared to the single C 12 E 10 
micelles, i.e. they are indirect arguments in favor of the fact that mixed aggregation occurs

in the nonionic surfactant/polymer system. The examination of the C 12 E 10 /PEI/La(III) 
ternary system with a polarizing microscope revealed the lyotropic mesomorphism with 
fan texture typical for the hexagonal packing. The concentration and temperature ranges 
of the hexagonal phase were determined. The ternary system is found to be an effective 
nanosized catalyst in both micellar and mesophase regions. It demonstrates the complex 
mechanism of the catalytic effect under mild conditions (25    ° C, pH  ∼ 8.0) and the substrate 
speciﬁ city towards the more hydrophobic phosphonate. A marked ( ca. 10 3 - fold) accelera-
tion of the reaction studied as compared to the basic hydrolysis of the substrates has been 
attained. 46 
 15.5.1.4  The Cationic Surfactants/ PEI Supramolecular Catalytic Systems 
 The cationic surfactant - polymer systems are much less studied than those based on 
anionic or nonionic surfactants. In works,  47,48   the catalytic effect of the cationic surfactant/
PEI systems towards hydrolyses of  1 ,  3 ,  5  and  6  is studied, in cases when the molecular 
mass of PEI and the structure of the head group of surfactants experience changes. In the 
CTAB/PEI - 10 system the acceleration of hydrolyses of all the substrates studied is 
observed. The catalytic effect depends to a great extent on the structure of phosphonates 
and varies within the interval 4 – 1500 (Table  15.1 ), with the maximum acceleration occur-
ring for phosphonate  3 . 48   The observed rate constant in the binary CTAB/PEI - 10 system 
decreases in the series  3  >  1  >  6  >  5 . In the water alkali solutions in the absence of the 
surfactant and PEI the k obs  of the basic hydrolysis changes as follows:  1  >  3  >  5  >  6 , while 
in the CTAB micellar solution with no PEI added the order is  3  >  1  >  5  >  6 . 11 These dif-
ferences in the reactivity are due to the fact that the basic factors controlling the reactivity 
in the surfactant free solutions are the electronic and steric effects of substituents at the 
reaction centre, while in the organized solutions a marked contribution to the catalytic 
effect is made by binding the reagent in nanoaggregates, which correlates with the hydro-
phobicity of compounds. The above inversion of reactivity in the pairs of substrates  1 ,  3 
and  5 ,  6  in the mixed polymer - surfactant systems as compared to aqueous basic hydrolysis 
is due to (i) the change in the mechanism of the hydrolysis in the presence of PEI, i.e. 
the transfer from the speciﬁ c to general basic catalysis and (ii) the peculiarity of the 
catalysis in constrained systems, in which the main contributor is the concentrating of 
reagents due to their binding by supramolecular ensembles. For the substrates  1 and  3 the 
inﬂ uence of substituents in aqueous and micellar pseudo phase is similar, which is evident 
from the decrease of  k 2,m  with the length of the alkyl radical at reaction centre (Table 
 15.1 ). However, there occurs a considerable increase in the binding constant of the more 
hydrophobic substrate ( k 2,m  =  0.0070 and 0.0043  M  − 1  s  − 1 ; K S  =  250 and 950  M  − 1  for  1 and 
 3  respectively), which is just responsible for the higher observed rate constants for 
phosphonate  3 . 
 In work, 47   the hydrolyses of phosphonates  1 ,  3  and  p - nitrophenyldiphenyl phosphate 
( 16 ) in the systems based on PEI - 30 and two cationic surfactants CTAB and cetyldimeth-
ylethylammonium bromide (CDAB) are studied. The nature of substrate and the structure 
of the head group is found to markedly inﬂ uence the reaction rate in these systems. The 
maximum value of the observed rate constant of  1  in the CTAB/PEI - 30 system is twofold 
higher than that in the CDAB based system, while for the phosphonate  3  k obs  is threefold

the substrates in both systems (Table  15.1 ). The observed rate constants of  16  are much 
lower than those for  1 and  3 , which is due to the low k 2,m value (Table  15.1 ). Unlike the 
phosphonates  1 ,  3  a little difference in the reactivity of  16  in CTAB and CDAB is 
observed. In the CDAB aqueous solutions the hexagonal liquid crystalline mesophase 
(E - phase) is formed above the concentration of 0.4   M. The kinetic study of the reactions 
when the E - phase is formed demonstrates a decrease in the observed rate constant of the 
hydrolyses of the substrates with the ordering of solution. 
 In works, 49,50   the formation of the supramolecular systems based on branched and 
hydrophobized (alkyl - substituted) PEIs is revealed in both the absence and presence 
of cationic surfactants including those with hydroxyalkylated head groups. The latter 
are capable of speciﬁ c interactions with other components of the systems, in particular, 
polymer and reagents. Hydrophobization of PEIs is found to result in a sharp increase 
in their solubilizing and catalytic efﬁ ciency. Besides, a marked increase in the catalysis 
occurs on transfer from conventional cationic surfactants to hydroxyalkylated ana-
logues. By means of the optimization of the catalytic composition and reaction con-
ditions a substantial 700 – 2000 - fold acceleration of the phosphonate  1  is reached at 
neutral pH. 50 
 15.5.2  The Pyrimidinic Surfactant Based Systems 
 In works, 51 – 53   the above step - by - step approach was extended to a new type of building 
blocks, namely pyrimidinic dimeric surfactants. The self - organization of new amphiphilic 
pyrimidinic macrocycles of dimeric structure APM - 1 and APM - 2 (Scheme  15.2 ) has been 
studied in aqueous solutions.  51   The complex examination of the APM based systems with 
the help of tensiometry, conductometry, dynamic light scattering, UV - , and NMR -
 spectroscopy provides evidence for their aggregation. Calculations based on the surface 
tension isotherms and on the packing parameter considerations (P  ∼ 1) make it possible 
to assume a lamellar packing of macrocycles when aggregating. Marked differences in 
the aggregation behaviour of APM - 1 and APM - 2 have been found. In the tensiometry 
study, the lower cmc and higher cross - section area per molecule are found for APM - 2 as 
compared to APM - 1. The additives of PEI do not exert much inﬂ uence on the cmc of 
APM - 1. A pronounced decrease in cmc and also a ca. twofold decrease in the surface 
area per molecule occur in the APM - 2/PEI systems. This can indicate the transition from 
the folded to the extended packing mode. The APM ensembles are explored as nanoreac-
tors for the hydrolyses of phosphonic acid esters. The kinetic study reveals a minor rate 
effect of the APM - 1 based systems on hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3 . Opposite to 
this the acceleration of the hydrolyses of both phosphonates occurs in the APM - 2 based 
systems as compared to the uncatalyzed process. The dramatic differences in the catalytic 
activity of the two macrocycles are assumed to be underlain by the different morphology 
of aggregates. Within the APM - 2 → APM - 2/PEI → APM - 2/PEI/La(III) series, due to the 
cooperative contributions of the micellar, polymer and homogeneous catalysis an increase 
in the catalytic effect is observed from 30 times to three orders of magnitude as compared 
to the basic hydrolysis. 
 In work, 52   two dimeric pyrimidinic surfactants (DPS), acyclic analogues of APM - 1 
were synthesized: a gemini surfactant DPS - 1, and a typical bolaform surfactant DPS - 2 
(Scheme  15.2 ). The catalytic effect of the single surfactant solutions and their mixtures

with PEI towards hydrolyses of  1  and  3  was studied. They exhibit speciﬁ c aggregation 
and catalytic properties. The more hydrophobic surfactant DPS - 1 demonstrates behaviour 
typical for cationic surfactants, in particular, it shows catalytic activity towards hydrolyses 
of phosphonates, which increases with the substrate hydrophobicity. In the DPS - 2 based 
systems, a 25 - fold inhibition of the reaction occurs, with no substrate speciﬁ city. Such 
behaviour is rather unusual for a cationic surfactant. The differences in the aggregation 
and catalytic properties can be due to the differences in the packing mode between the 
DPS - 1 and DPS - 2 molecules when self - assembling. 
 Recently, new amphiphilic pyrimidinic compounds with different kinds of counterions, 
inorganic bromide anions (APB) and hydrophobic tosylate anions (APT) were synthe-
sized, 53   which showed intermediate hydrophobicity between DPS - 1 and DPS - 2. The cata-
lytic effect towards basic hydrolyses of  1  and  3  is examined. For comparison, the rate 
effect of conventional surfactants CTAB and cetyltrimethylammonium tosylate (CTAT) 
with similar counterions is studied as well. Both CTAB and APB solutions accelerate 
hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3 . Surfactants with hydrophobic anions demonstrate a 
different behaviour, namely, hydrolysis of phosphonate  3 is accelerated by CTAT and 
APT micelles, while the less hydrophobic substrate  1  is retarded by the APT micelles 
unless alkali excess is used. This deviation from the typical behaviour for cationic sur-
factants is due to the decrease in solution pH with APT concentration above the cmc. 
Detailed self - organization studies by methods of tensiometry, conductometry, potentiom-
etry and NMR spectroscopy were conducted. A marked difference in the structural 
behaviour between the AP - type and conventional CTA surfactants is found: (i) for both 
pairs APB/CTAB and APT/CTAT studied the counterion binding is stronger for the 
conventional cationic surfactants as compared to dimeric pyrimidinic surfactants; (ii) 
although a structural transition is probably observed in the APT micelles at C    ≥  0.01  M, 
no sharp micellar growth occurs with the APT concentration, as distinct from the CTAT 
micelles; (iii) the cmc ’ s of dimeric surfactants are only a little lower than those of CTA 
analogues. The geometry of AP compounds may be assumed to be mainly responsible 
for the above result. A branched molecular architecture prevents the close packing of the 
monomers in the bulk solution and at the interface and produces a steric hindrance around 
the head groups. This effect can be responsible for the high surface potential, and hence 
for the decrease in solution pH due to the polarization of the hydrated water molecules 
and their further deprotonation. 
 15.5.3  The Calixarene Based Systems 
 Recently, new building blocks, in particular, amphiphilic calixarenes were explored for 
the design of polycomponent catalysts.  54 – 57   We intended testing the contribution of the 
inclusive interactions to the self - assembling of components. In works,  54,55 the aggregation 
behaviour and catalytic activity of PEI and sulfonatomethylated calix[4]resorcinarene 
(SCA) (Scheme  15.3 ) based systems are studied by methods of the NMR and UV - vis 
spectroscopy. The mixed PEI − SCA assembling is shown to occur in the concentration 
range lower than the cmc indicated by the tensiometry data (cmc   =  0.011  M) due to the 
inclusive type of the PEI − SCA interactions. Different modes of self - organization assum-
ing the PEI inclusion into the calixarene cavity are discussed: (i) the layered ensembles 
separated by the PEI chains dipped into the cavity, and (ii) the SCA molecules penetrated

with PEI of the pseudorotaxane type. The latter is in good agreement with the extensive 
NMR and calculating data for this system.  
 In the kinetic studies the step - by - step investigation of the catalytic activity towards the 
hydrolytic cleavage of phosphonate  1  and  p - nitrophenyl dimethyl phosphate ( 17 ) has been 
carried out in the single PEI system, the binary PEI/SCA system and the ternary PEI/
SCA/La(III) system. Two reaction routes of hydrolysis of  17  (the leaving of aromatic 
versus alcohol fragment) are revealed in the single PEI solution and the binary PEI/SCA 
systems by both NMR and UV - vis studies, while in the presence of La(III) only the 
departure of  p  - nitrophenolate group occurs. The addition of noncatalytic SCA to the PEI 
solution is shown to result in a tenfold acceleration of the reaction below the cmc due to 
the catalytic action of the PEI/SCA inclusive type ensembles. The ternary PEI/SCA/
La(III) system demonstrates a marked catalytic activity attaining two (for  1 ) and four (for 
 17 ) orders of magnitude due to superposition of several factors of catalysis. 
 In work, 56 the aggregation behaviour and catalytic activity of supramolecular systems 
composed of three basic components in different combinations are investigated. They are 
amphiphilic calix[4]resorcinarene CR - 1 (Scheme  15.3 ), anionic surfactant SDS and PEI -
 25, either of which is capable of self - assembling in solution and interacting through a 
 ‘ guest – host ’  mechanism. The evaluations of the size of aggregates, cloud points and cata-
lytic properties are in agreement with the assumption on the mixed aggregation in the 
systems studied. The step - by - step investigation of the catalytic effect towards hydrolyses 
of phosphonates  1  and  3  is performed in the series of supramolecular systems CR - 1/SDS; 
CR - 1/PEI; SDS/PEI; CR - 1/SDS/PEI. The change from ca. 20 - fold inhibition of the reac-
tion in ensembles of anionic amphiphiles CR - 1 and SDS to the tenfold catalysis occurs 
due to the immobilization of anionic nanoreactors at the catalytically active polymer 
matrix, PEI. The possibility for the transfer from the microheterogeneous to the hetero-
geneous system and for the separation of the catalyst and products by the cloud point 
strategy is presented.

ratio between unsubstituted and hydroxybenzylated fragments amounts to 0.3; 0.12; 0.16 
and 0.3 for PEI 1 , PEI 2 , PEI 3  and PEI 4  respectively. The formation of the mixed PEI/CTAB 
and PEI/PM ensembles are supported by dielcometric titration, dynamic light scattering, 
viscosimetry and the solubilization of  p - nitrophenol measurements. The character and 
extent of their inﬂ uence on the phosphorylation of PEIs is found to depend on the PEI/
surfactants ratio, on the component structure, and on the temperature. In the case of 
CTAB an acceleration of the reaction occurs throughout the whole concentration range 
studied, 58   while in the PEI/PM system an increase in the surfactant concentration at ﬁ rst 
results in the increase in the observed rate constant and then in its decrease.  59 The inver-
sion of the rate effect is probably due to the rearrangement of the supramolecular ensem-
bles. Indeed, the concentration range corresponding to the inhibition of the processes 
coincides with the formation of the lager aggregates (Figure  15.5 ).  59 The surfactant rate 
effects on the phosphorylation of PEI equal the ca. 6 – 7 - fold acceleration (for CTAB) or 
the inhibition of the same magnitude (for PM).  58,59   The use of the CTAB/PM mixture 
provides a marked increase in the catalytic effect, which depends on the molar ratio of 
the surfactant, reaching ca. 24 - fold acceleration.  60   The rate enhancement increases in the

series PEI 1  <  PEI 4  <  PEI 3  <  PEI 2 . The quantitative treatment of the kinetic data in terms 
of pseudo phase model demonstrates that small as it is the factor of concentration of 
reagents mainly contributes to the rate effect. Indeed, the microenvironment factor may 
vary from the negative inﬂ uence (F m  =  0.32 for PEI 1 ) to 1.0 for PEI 4 , while the concen-
tration factor F c > 1 in all cases, thereby provides the acceleration of the reaction.   
 In work, 61   the reaction of alkylated branched PEI - 10 (APEI - 10) bearing tetradecyl 
substituents (PEI 5 ) with phosphinate  12  is studied in the presence of PM in toluene. The 
 k obs  versus C PM  dependence has an extremum. A maximum twofold acceleration of 
the reaction is observed, followed by a  ca. 5 – 7 - fold inhibition with the further increase 
in the surfactant concentration. Similar to the above phosphorylation reaction, the unfa-
vorable inﬂ uence of the microenvironment and the prevalent positive contribution of the 
concentration factor occur in this system. In particular, the values F m  =  0.55 and F c  =  31.0 
are obtained when ﬁ tting the kinetic data in terms of Equation  15.1 (Table  15.1 ). 
 In work, 62   the complexation of APEI - 10 bearing  n - tetradecyl (PEI 5 , PEI 6 ) and  n - nonyl 
(PEI 7 ) radicals (the extent of substitution of 0.3; 0.6 and 0.26 respectively) with function-
alized calix[4]resorcinarenes (CR) in chloroform is revealed by methods of UV - Vis 
spectrophotometry, dielcometric titration and dynamic light scattering. The CRs alkylated 
or phosphorylated at low rim are studied (Scheme  15.3 ). The complexation of PEI and 
CR is shown to change the nucleophilicity of the polymer, which is exempliﬁ ed by the 
reaction between APEI and phosphinate  12 . 63   Based on the NMR   31  P data a conclusion 
is drawn that PEI rather than CR functions as a nucleophile towards the substrate in the 
PEI/CR/chloroform system. CR mediates this reaction as a catalytic species involved in 
the mixed aggregation. The rate effect depends on the ratio of components and their 
structure. A decrease in the hydrophobicity and increase in the extent of substitution of 
PEI result in the enhancement of the catalysis. The highest  ca.  35 - fold acceleration of the 
phosphorylation occurs at the low CR and polymer concentrations. An additional 6 – 7 - fold 
increase in the catalytic effect can be attained by the addition of surfactants. For example, 
the PEI 5 /CR - 2/CTAB - chloroform system demonstrates a 45 - fold acceleration of the reac-
tion under study. 64 
 15.6  Conclusions 
 The catalytic effect of supramolecular systems based on amphiphilic compounds of dif-
ferent structure (surfactants, hydrophobized polymers, calixarenes, pyrimidinophanes) on 
the nucleophilic substitution at phosphorus and carbon has been investigated in both 
aqueous and nonaqueous media. They demonstrate a wide - range catalytic activity from 
the deep retardation of the reactions to the multiple accelerations to the point of several 
orders of magnitude. The factors determining the rate effect have been analyzed. Two 
main points should be emphasized, i.e. (i) the crucial role of the structural factors in the 
catalysis has been revealed; (ii) the catalytic effect of polycomponent ensembles is mark-
edly inﬂ uenced by the nature of components and their ratio. This indicates that reactivity 
in supramolecular systems can be controlled by the purposeful selection of catalytic 
species and by inducing structural transition in the systems. Besides, such kind of control 
requires knowledge of the structural behaviour of the systems, in particular, packing 
modes, morphology of aggregates, surface potential, etc.

 16.1  Introduction 
 16.1.1  Vesicular Aggregates 
 Surfactants, or amphiphiles, comprise a large class of compounds, characterized by one 
(or more) ionic or highly polar headgroups and one, two, or rarely more, hydrophobic 
alkyl tails (usually  n - C 8 to  n - C 22 , the most common being C 12 , C 14 , C 16 , C 18 , and C 20 ). In 
aqueous media, above a critical concentration, these systems cope with their dual struc-
tural properties by forming aggregates in which the headgroups are in contact with water 
while the alkyl chains reside in the core of the aggregate, avoiding interactions with the 
aqueous medium. 
 A variety of different morphologies are possible for these aggregates, depending on 
the molecular structure of the single amphiphilic molecule, including their size and shape. 
But other factors like ionic strength, temperature, pressure and pH also play a role. 1 
 Vesicles (from the Latin vesicula, small bubble) belong to the most extensively studied 
amphiphilic aggregates.  2   Not only because the bilayer membrane is the building block of 
cell membranes, but also because vesicles or liposomes offer the unique possibility for 
solutes to bind to the outer -  and inner leaﬂ ets of the bilayer whereas the hydrophobic 
interior of the bilayer can be used to entrap hydrophobic solutes and also membrane 
proteins.

Molecular Encapsulation
 The Gibbs energy of a vesicle depends on a compromise of attractive and repulsive 
interactions. The main contributions come from hydrophobic interactions between the 
tails, the major driving force for aggregation, and from repulsive interactions between the 
headgroups at the aqueous interface, which, in case of ionic surfactants, are in part com-
pensated by counterion binding. This counterion binding is usually stronger for vesicles 
than for micelles.  3   Other factors also play a role, one of them being the loss of confor-
mational entropy of the hydrocarbon tails in the vesicular core. 
 Water is the essential medium for surfactant aggregation, although association can 
occasionally also occur in polar solvents with a high cohesive energy density.  4 
 Which factors determine the packing efﬁ ciency of the amphiphiles in the aggregate? 
The dimensionless shape factor or packing parameter (P) provides a relation between the 
molecular shape of the amphiphile and the preferred morphology of the aggregate in dilute 
aqueous solution at low ionic strength and at ambient temperatures:  5

 Herein, V is the volume of the hydrophobic chain, a 0  the optimal cross - sectional surface 
area of the headgroup, and l c  the length of the all -  trans  alkyl tails. It will be clear that the 
curvature of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface is related to the value of P. The rela-
tion between the aggregate morphology and P is given in Figure  16.1 . The packing 
parameter concept provides a reasonable and useful rationalization of the rich polymor-
phism of surfactant aggregates, but it has also been criticized. A signiﬁ cant issue is, of 
course, that the values of a 0  and l c  are not independent of each other.  6 Nevertheless, 
extensive studies of a large series of amphiphiles in which the structure was gradually 
modiﬁ ed showed that the approach worked satisfactorily. 7,8 
 It was Bangham who, in the sixties of the past century discovered that liposomes could 
be made from egg yolk.  9   But phospholipids are by no means unique in this behaviour. 
Kunitake 10   showed that bilayer vesicles can be obtained from synthetic surfactants in case 
0.5  <  P  <  1.0, while for P  =  1.0 a ﬂ at bilayer is formed.  11   Bilayer morphologies, usually 
preferred by double - tailed amphiphiles, are shown in Figure  16.2  and are called lamellar 
phases. The bilayer consists of two opposing layers of amphiphiles, with the aligned tails 
facing each other and the headgroups situated at the aqueous interface. In case the two 
ends of the bilayer close to form a global structure with an aqueous inner compartment, 
the aggregate is called a vesicle, or a liposome if the amphiphilic constituent is a phos-
pholipid molecule. Mammalian cell membranes may contain microdomains ( ‘ rafts ’ ) 
which can also be formed in multicomponent liposomes.  12,13   For the structures of the most 
common phospholipids in cell membranes, the reader is referred to appropriate biochem-
istry textbooks. 
 Vesicles and particularly liposomes are highly useful, although severely simpliﬁ ed, 
models for biological membranes. 
 Conventional molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of the formation of small dipalmi-
toylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes in atomistic detail (1017 DPPC molecules in 
106.563 waters) have provided mechanistic insights into some general features of lipo-
some formation.  14   In the very rapid initial stages of the aggregation process micellar - like 
structures are formed. Lipid bridging between these micelles leads to larger, lamellar 
morphologies, which are, in fact, curved bilayers. Spontaneous development of curvature, 
resulting from minimization of edge energy, is then claimed to induce formation of

liposome - like shapes. These contain water pores with diameters of 1 – 4  nm, allowing rela-
tively slow equilibration of lipid molecules between the inner and outer leaﬂ ets by diffu-
sion. This so - called  ‘ ﬂ ip - ﬂ op ’  has also been studied in mature vesicles already many years 
ago. 15   Finally these processes result in collapse of the water pores and formation of the 
most stable liposomal aggregate. 16,17 Spontaneous formation of vesicles from mixed 
amphiphiles as well as the interaction of vesicles with other molecules (including choles-
terol 18 ) has also been investigated using MD techniques. 19 
 With a few exceptions (catanionic vesicles, for example  20,21  ), vesicles are metastable 
aggregates and posses a tendency to undergo aggregation followed by merging of the 
bilayers and eventually precipitation. Therefore vesicles can be best coined as  ‘ colloidal 
structures ’ . 22   Apart from catanionic vesicles and contrary to the suggestion by some MD 
simulations,  14   closed vesicle formation from single amphiphilic molecules is not sponta-
neous but requires input of mechanical energy such as shaking, stirring, extrusion or 
sonication, inducing formation of closed vesicles from bilayer sheets and increasing the 
bilayer curvature and reducing the vesicular size. In fact, the method of vesicle prepara-
tion has an effect on the exact lamellar structure and on the vesicular size.  23,24 A bending 
energy can be deﬁ ned for formation of a closed vesicle from a bilayer sheet. The curvature 
stress energy for a bilayer can be calculated with the (simpliﬁ ed) Helfrich Gibbs energy 
equation. 25   In contrast to micelles, vesicles tend to separate from their dispersions, but 
this process may take a considerable time span (ranging from seconds to months). 
 To prove the formation of vesicles a number of indirect techniques can be used such 
as dynamic light scattering, the use of ﬂ uorescent probes and pulsed ﬁ eld gradient NMR 
self - diffusion measurements. Some more direct techniques such as freeze - fracture and 
negative staining electron microscopy are less biased by the interpretation of the scientist, 
but also these methods have their limitations. Cryo - electron microscopy, as introduced 
by Dubochet in the 80s,   26   is the method of choice when it comes to visualization of small 
colloidal structures.  27   Recent developments in the vitriﬁ cation of specimens make it now 
possible to observe vesicles and other aggregated structures artifact free. 
 Vesicles with sizes varying from nanometers to micrometers usually contain large 
numbers of surfactant molecules. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) possess diameters 
which may vary considerably (50 – 500   nm) and have a large encapsulation efﬁ ciency 
(5 – 20  l  mol  − 1 ). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with diameters of 20 – 50  nm encapsulate 
smaller volumes (0.5 – 1.0  l  mol  − 1 ) Under special conditions, giant vesicles may be formed 
(diameter in the order of 1 – 500  µ m) with a low bilayer curvature, akin to that of a ﬂ at 
bilayer. 28,29   These giant vesicles are able to eject smaller vesicles by a budding process.  30 
 In vesicles, the ﬂ uidity of the bilayer  31   and the associated stiffness and order of the 
alkyl tails can vary signiﬁ cantly as a function of temperature, but, of course, also depend-
ing on the detailed structure (straight or branched), size, and the presence of one or more 
double or triple carbon – carbon bonds in the tails. At lower temperatures, the bilayers 
reside in the gel phase (L  β  ) with the strongest packing of the all -  trans  alkyl chains and 
with the largest order and rigidity. Upon increasing the temperature, a cooperative phase 
transition occurs to the L  α   or liquid crystalline phase with a more liquid - like core, allow-
ing fast diffusion of the amphiphilic components, and in which gauche conformations 
of the alkyl tails are allowed. As expected this main phase transition temperature 
(T c ) becomes lower if the alkyl chains are shortened or if unsaturation is introduced into 
the tails.

Encapsulation Processes by Bilayer Vesicles 
425
 Sometimes an intermediate  ‘ rippled ’  phase (  P ′
β ) 32 is ﬁ rst formed from the L  β  phase, 
which transforms to the L  α   phase at higher temperatures. At still more elevated tempera-
tures, the lamellar phase may change into inverted cubic (I  β  ) or related isotropic phases.  33,34 
These highly complex aggregates have been proposed as intermediates during membrane 
fusion. A further temperature increase may lead to formation of inverted hexagonal phases 
(H II ), in which the weakly hydrated amphiphiles are packed in inverted micellar - like 
cylinders, with the headgroups facing inside and in contact with water in the enclosed 
compartment. 
 Vesicles possess many interesting potentials for applications, one of the most important 
being encapsulation of solutes, a phenomenon that has been investigated in detail and has 
been utilized in different ways. To get insight into the possibilities for encapsulation, 
unavoidably involving disturbances of the bilayer structuring and to predict which binding 
sites are available for solubilizates of different chemical composition, we can have a look 
at the lateral pressure proﬁ le, extensively investigated by Cantor. 35,36 The lateral pressure 
(LP) is deﬁ ned as d  π (z) acting within a thin slice of the bilayer with thickness dz. Positive 
values of the LP indicate repulsion, negative values stand for attraction. The lateral pres-
sure density is then given by p(z)   =   d  π /dz, with dimensions of bulk pressures. At the 
aqueous interface of the membrane, the headgroups repel each other (positive LP), 
whereas at the interface somewhat deeper into the bilayer, the tails attract each other 
through hydrophobic interactions leading to a large, negative LP. Still deeper in the 
membrane, there is little or no water and the enforced partial ordening of the tails is 
accompanied by a considerable loss of entropy due to their reduced conformational 
freedom. This means repulsion and a positive LP in the central part of the core of the 
bilayer. The variation of the LP with the depth in the membrane is an important issue and 
has been applied in detail in the ﬁ eld of bilayer - protein interactions. 37 
 Figure  16.3  shows a LP proﬁ le for one mono - layer, the proﬁ le for the opposite mono-
layer is the same. We see how the LP varies with depth in the membrane. Since the 
formation of a vesicular membrane is associated with a favorable Gibbs energy, the total 
lateral pressure in the membrane is zero (or nearly so).   
 The lateral pressure concept provides useful insight into the spatial distribution of 
forces and is a sum over terms corresponding to layers of ﬁ nite thickness (dz).  38 Quantitative 
measurements of the LP remain difﬁ cult and even the concept has been criticized. 39 
 Chain order parameters, measured by  2 H - NMR studies on amphiphiles with speciﬁ cally 
deuterium - labelled methylene units in the tails,  40 – 42   gave a similar view of the distribution 
of the chain attractions/repulsions as a function of position in the tails. Increasing quad-
rupole splittings, indicated by an increasing distance between the two peaks in the  2 H -
 NMR spectrum, are associated with increasing chain order. 
 In sum, a larger repulsion between speciﬁ c parts of the alkyl chains in a bilayer is 
reﬂ ected in a higher lateral pressure, a decrease in chain order and more area available 
for that part of the tails. Such changes can be induced by, for example, a higher tempera-
ture or introduction of a  cis C = C bond into the tail or via  trans – cis  isomerization of 
double - tailed, azobenzene - substituted amphihiles. 43 
 In recent years, several computational methods have been developed to calculate LP 
proﬁ les in membranes. Among them, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been 
particularly successful. Timescales extending to hundreds of nanoseconds are now com-
putationally feasible, but the simulations are still restricted to relatively small system

sizes. MD is also useful in studies of undulatory and thickness ﬂ uctuation modes of 
bilayers. 44 
 Finally we note that, apart from double - tailed surfactant molecules, vesicular aggre-
gates can also be formed from a number of other building blocks, including nonionic 
amphiphiles to form niosomes,  45 single - tailed surfactants 46,47   and complex (co)polymers, 
polypeptides, and dendrimers.  48   In this chapter we restrict our discussion to encapsulation 
processes by vesicles formed from synthetic surfactants and phospholipids.  
 16.1.2  Solute Encapsulation by Vesicles 
 It will be obvious that the encapsulation of a solute molecule into a vesicular membrane 
will affect the interchain interactions in the bilayer.  49   Overall, the Gibbs energy for 
binding should be negative, otherwise the solute would remain in bulk solution. Therefore, 
partitioning of a relatively apolar solute into the membrane will be most favorable at a 
location with the best balance between solubilizate - tail and solubilizate - headgroup inter-
actions on one hand and changes in tail - tail interactions on the other hand. These coun-
teracting contributions will also signiﬁ cantly depend on hydration changes. On the other 
hand, the (solvation) properties of the solubilizate are also different from those in dilute 
aqueous solution as a result of binding in the vesicular bilayer. 
 In this brief review we will describe some important encapsulation processes by vesicu-
lar aggregates. Encapsulation will be broadly interpreted. Apart from solubilization in the 
aqueous pool inside the vesicle, the term will also encompass binding of solubilizates to 
all binding sites available in the vesicular system. We will not discuss bilayer vesicles 
formed from amphiphiles further functionalized by receptor molecules, such as amphiphilic 
cyclodextrins.  50 
 Instead of a comprehensive review of the vast literature on solute encapsulation, a 
selection will be made of various illustrative binding possibilities in or at the bilayer.

Encapsulation Processes by Bilayer Vesicles 
427
Although binding to vesicles has been less extensively studied than binding to micelles, 
attempts will be made to rationalize why speciﬁ c solute molecules bind to particular 
binding locations. 
 16.1.3  Binding Locations 
 Let us now look at the different locations for spontaneous encapsulation of solutes of 
different chemical composition. First of all, it goes without saying that encapsulation 
experiments should be carried out under well - deﬁ ned conditions. Often vesicles, after 
their preparation, and subsequently after binding of the solubilizate, need time to arrive 
at their most stable conﬁ gurations (size, tail ordering) and adequate attention should be 
given to this issue. This process may sometimes take days at room temperature. Also the 
method used for their preparation may exert a deﬁ nite effect on the vesicular properties. 
Thus, for a honest comparison of encapsulation abilities, it is recommended that the vesi-
cles are prepared under exactly the same conditions and that their properties are checked 
by a proper physical technique, such as cryo - electron microscopy. Also temperature 
control needs attention since the gel and liquid - crystalline phase exhibit different binding 
efﬁ ciencies of solutes. 
 The binding locations can be charaterized as follows: 
  (a)     In the outer Stern region, where the solute interacts almost exclusively with the polar 
or ionic headgroups. In case of ionic headgroups, relatively hydrophilic solutes, car-
rying opposite charges (preferably double - charged) are the best candidates for strong 
binding. Interaction is mainly governed by electrostatic forces. Close approach 
between oppositely charged ionic moieties is necessarily accompanied by partial 
dehydration of the ions, an effect that may in part counteract the attractive 
interactions. 
 Hydrophilic solutes like carbohydrates, i.e. glucose, sucrose, and trehalose also 
bind close to the charged headgroups, replacing hydration water, as laid down in the 
 ‘ water - replacement hypothesis ’ . 51   They act as cryoprotectants and help to stabilize 
the bilayer in case of insufﬁ cient water. 
 There is now compelling evidence that selective hydrogen - bonding interactions 
between functional groups of hydrophobically - buried molecules residing near the 
vesicle - water interface are able to overcome the otherwise dominant hydrogen 
bonding to water molecules, present in high excess. A recent example is the self -
 adhesion among phospholipid vesicles carrying adhesive agents.  52 Such associations 
in the aqueous interface are largely governed by entropic factors, as discussed in a 
beautiful review.  53   The entropic costs for association of ligands tethered to the surface 
of vesicles are smaller than those for interaction of similar species diffusing independ-
ently in three dimensions in an aqueous medium. 
 A highly unexpected result, ﬁ rst reported in 2003, was the efﬁ cient adsorption of 
hydroxide ions at pH values slightly above 7.5 to (almost) uncharged hydrophobic 
surfaces 54   and vesicular surfaces formed by reduced - sugar based gemini surfactants.  55,56 
The origin of this phenomenon has been investigated in some detail. 57 
 (b)  In the  ‘ inner ’  Stern layer, that is at binding locations with negative LP values, at a 
few methylene units from the headgroups. These are the most frequently encountered 
binding sites where relatively hydrophobic solutes preferably interact with the partly

Molecular Encapsulation
hydrated alkyl tails through hydrophobic interactions. Often these solutes also possess 
a hydrophilic substituent, necessary for sufﬁ cient water solubility, and this substituent 
will be preferentially directed towards the more aqueous region of a bilayer for ben-
eﬁ cial contact with water. Incorporation of solutes may disturb the tail – tail interac-
tions to some extent. An example is provided by the anchoring of hydrophobically 
modiﬁ ed poly(sodium acrylate)s into di -  n  - dodecylphosphate (DDP) vesicles. In case 
the polymer contains  n  - dodecyl chains, the bilayer is hardly affected as indicated by 
detailed DSC measurements. By contrast, for  n - nonyl and  n - octadecyl chains the 
hydrophobic mismatch leads to lower main phase transition temperatures and reduced 
enthalpies of transition per mole of DDP monomer. Another notable consequence of 
binding of the hydrophobically modiﬁ ed polymer into the vesicle bilayer is the 
increase of the cooperativity of the melting process, probably resulting from the pres-
ence of larger  ‘ patches ’  with a lower curvature.  58   Another interesting effect induced 
by hydrophobic mismatching is the clustering of membrane proteins in case their 
hydrophobic transmembrane domains do not match with the surrounding lipid 
bilayer. 59 
 Interestingly, transvesicular reactions between substrates bound in the exovesicular 
and endovesicular leaﬂ ets have been studied, particularly at relatively low vesicular 
ﬂ uidities. 60 
  (c)     Deep in the interior of the bilayer. These are the preferred binding locations for 
strongly hydrophobic molecules. The chain order is relatively low in this region and 
the LP is positive. There is also more free volume available for incoming hydrophobic 
solutes. These binding processes will affect bilayer dynamics. 
 It has recently been shown that introduction of a small, hydrophobic molecule like 
isoprene may lead to a more ordered and better packed lipid membrane as revealed 
by MD simulations. The stabilized membrane is then protected against temperature -
 induced disordering of the tails.  61   Similar thermoprotective effects are induced by 
cholesterol which also increases the molecular packing of the tails and, in contrast to 
isoprene, affects the dynamics of the lipids in the bilayer. 62 
  (d)     In the aqueous inner compartment of the vesicle. Sufﬁ ciently hydrophilic solutes can 
be entrapped in the aqueous medium inside the vesicular system and may favourably 
interact with the headgroups stacking into this medium.  63   In contrast to the protocols 
used for binding at the sides labelled (a) – (c), binding in the water pool is realized by 
preparation of the vesicle dispersion in a medium already containing the solute. 
During the formation of the vesicular aggregate, the solute becomes entrapped in the 
inner aqueous compartment. Of course, a prerequisite for this type of encapsulation 
is that leakage over the bilayer is slow. Carboxyﬂ uorescein, a highly water - soluble 
ﬂ uorescent dye, has been extensively used to probe leakage over vesicular bilayers. 63 
Strong bilayer packing, as induced by encapsulated cholesterol, slows down leakage 
processes. 
 Finally, we stress that the bound solutes are often certainly not localized at a single, 
precisely deﬁ ned, position but may exchange rapidly between various positions of 
similar binding characteristics and partition coefﬁ cients. 
 As we will discuss below, microencapsulation offers interesting possibilities for reac-
tivity control. 64

 16.1.4  Experimental Techniques for Measuring Encapsulation Processes 
 It is obvious that binding of a solute to a vesicle will induce changes in the physical 
properties of both solute and the amphiphilic molecules that make up the bilayer aggre-
gate. Two sorts of information can be obtained from these changes. First, the strength of 
the interaction, which can be quantiﬁ ed by the solvent/bilayer partition coefﬁ cient of the 
solute. Second, in many cases information can be obtained regarding the location of the 
binding site although the exact interpretation of the experimental data can be quite chal-
lenging. Both types of data are of immediate importance for applications of the particular 
vesicular aggregates. 
 A brief summary will now follow of some of the most frequently employed experi-
mental techniques. Several of these have been particularly applied for micellar aggregates, 
but their usage can often be easily extended to vesicles. 
 16.1.4.1  Microcalorimetry 
 The greatly improved sensitivity of the modern microcalorimeters for both differential 
scanning microcalorimetry (DSC) and isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) has 
made their application highly useful. Titration microcalorimetry yields binding constants 
and, when applied as a function of temperature, full thermodynamic details for the binding 
process. 65   DSC provides details about the disturbance of the bilayer system by the solu-
bilized guest from which conclusions may be drawn about the preferred binding 
locations. 
 16.1.4.2  NMR Spectroscopy 
 Ring current effects have already been examined more than twenty years ago and indi-
cated which groups are in close proximity to an aromatic ring in the solute or in the 
amphiphile. This is useful information but the exact positioning of these interaction sites 
within the bilayer may remain a problem.  66,67   Nuclear Overhauser effects have also been 
employed frequently. 
 Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments measure the distribution coefﬁ -
cients of solubilizates.  68,69   A comparison is made between the proton spin – lattice relaxa-
tion rates of the solubilizate in the absence and presence of noncomplexing paramagnetic 
ions of the same sign of charge as the headgoups. Such paramagnetic ions reside neces-
sarily in the bulk solvent and their effect on the nuclei of the solubilizate depend on the 
efﬁ ciency of penetration of the solubilizate into the core of the bilayer. The method is 
applicable for a variety of NMR - active nuclei in the guest molecule. These results can be 
compared with those obtained from Fourier transform pulsed gradient spin - echo NMR 
self - diffusion measurements. 
 16.1.4.3  Phosphorescence, Fluorescence and Steady - state Absorption Techniques 
 These techniques can be employed for quantitative studies of the distribution constants 
of solubilizates as well as for measuring the kinetics of solubilization. Binding at the 
surface or in the core of the aggregate can be distinguished under favorable conditions 
by ﬂ uorescence probing. 70 – 72

Molecular Encapsulation
 Solvatochromic probes like Nile Red allow characterization of temperature - dependent 
phase transitions. This is possible due to the large difference in polarity between the 
ground and excited state of the probe.  73   At binding sites of signiﬁ cantly different polarity 
the probe exhibits selective excitation properties and excitation - dependent emission 
maxima. 
 16.1.4.4  Combined Fluorescence Quenching Experiments and 
Paramagnetic Resonance 
 Data obtained by this technique allow rather detailed conclusions about the location of 
the solubilizate in the aggregate. Fluorescence quenching rate constants vary with tem-
perature, local microviscosity and quencher concentration.  74 – 76   Encapsulation of spin 
probes has been examined in detail by EPR spectroscopy.  77 
 16.1.4.5  Cryo - Electron Microscopy 
 Apart from (bio - )chemical data, direct structural information of vesicles and micelles can 
be obtained by cryo - electron microscopy. Cryo - electron microscopy as introduced by 
Jaques Dubochet, 26 has now become a standard technique to gain artifact - free structural 
information within the natural solvent. In most cases water   78   is used but also other sol-
vents like polar organic solvents  79   and apolar solvents  80   can be employed. Thin layers of 
solvent with colloidal suspended material can be vitriﬁ ed by rapid cooling in liquid 
ethane. By remaining at low temperature inside an electron microscope the solvent will 
not evaporate in the high vacuum. This allows to gain high resolution structural 
information.  
 16.1.4.6  Miscellaneous Techniques 
 Other techniques that can be used to measure distribution coefﬁ cients of a guest molecule 
between the bulk aqueous phase and a micellar or vesicular aggregate include gel ﬁ ltra-
tion, electromotive force measurements, solubility and vapor pressure measurements, 
muon spin rotation experiments and headspace gas chromatography.  81 Theoretical models 
are, of course, also helpful, as, for example, in studies of the enveloping of charged pro-
teins by lipid bilayers. 25 
 16.2  Catalysis by Vesicles. Encapsulation of Reactants 
 Micellar catalysis and inhibition of organic reactions has been studied in great detail.  82 
Much less work has been performed on vesicular catalysis and inhibition. The fact that 
most vesicles are meta - stable aggregates is a reason for this lack of popularity. In order 
to obtain satisfactory reproducibility of the rate constants, adequate methods for vesicle 
formation are required and kinetic measurements have to be performed with special care. 
On the other hand, if the reaction is strongly medium dependent and rate constants can 
be measured accurately, rather subtle changes in substrate binding location can be nicely 
revealed. We note here that vesicular catalysis in water can be performed at lower sur-
factant concentrations than in case of micellar catalysis, which is a signiﬁ cant advantage 
from the view point of green chemistry.

Encapsulation Processes by Bilayer Vesicles 
431
 It will be clear that encapsulation of the reactant(s) is a prerequisite for vesicle - induced 
rate effects. In case of unimolecular organic reactions, the change in rate constant relative 
to the rate constant in bulk aqueous solution, is determined by the change in reaction 
environment going from water to the reactant binding sites in the vesicle. Several studies 
have suggested that the reaction environment in the vesicular phase is often less polar 
than that in micelles.  83   Of course, the kinetic effect is a function of the distribution of the 
reactant over the aqueous and vesicular pseudophases. If the medium effects on the reac-
tion are understood in some detail, the vesicle - induced rate effects provide information 
about the nature of the reactant encapsulation process. 
 For bimolecular organic reactions the situation is more complicated. We have now two 
reactants that bind to the vesicle (sometimes one may stay in the aqueous phase), not 
necessarily at similar sites in the aggregate. Vesicular catalysis/inhibition now depends 
on the same environmental factors as described for unimolecular reactions, but also on 
the binding efﬁ ciency, determining the reactant concentrations in the vesicular reaction 
volume. If reactant binding is sufﬁ ciently strong, the local reactant concentrations in the 
vesicular reaction volume may become greater than those in water, with the concominant 
higher rate resulting from this  ‘ concentration effect ’ . Even in the case of a vesicular rate 
constant smaller than the one in water, catalysis may nevertheless be observed due to the 
overruling effect of the higher reactant concentrations. 
 Encapsulation of the reactants in the vesicle can affect rate constants in a number of 
ways. These include the following: (a) a reduced medium polarity in the Stern region and 
particularly deeper in the bilayer; (b) a lower water concentration; (c) for charged vesicles: 
a local electric charge at the surface of the vesicle due to an incomplete counterion binding 
and a signiﬁ cant ionic strength in the Stern region; (d) rates may respond to the bilayer 
ﬂ uidity which is different below and above the main phase transiton temperature, and 
ﬁ nally, the vesicle size  84   may also play a role. We also note that giant vesicles provide 
interesting microchemical vessels for various types of reactions, including decontamina-
tion of mustard - like compounds and polymerization processes. 82 
 16.2.1  Unimolecular Decarboxylation of 6 - NBIC 
 The strongly solvent - dependent, unimolecular decarboxylation of sodium 6 - 
nitrobenzisoxazole - 3 - carboxylate (6 - NBIC, Figure  16.4 ) has been a popular kinetic 
probe for aqueous media containing surfactant aggregates. 
 After pioneering work by Kemp and Paul,  85   the main noncovalent interactions which 
govern the medium effects have been elucidated in some detail by Hilvert  et al . 86

Molecular Encapsulation
Hydrogen - bonding stabilization of the carboxylate group as well as ion - pair formation 
(particularly in apolar, aprotic solvents) retard the reaction by reactant stabilization. 
Breaking - up these interactions and stabilization of the highly polarizable activated 
complex (AC) by London dispersion interactions dramatically accelerate the decarboxyla-
tion. As anticipated, 6 - NBIC binds to positively charged surfaces of surfactant aggregates 
with the aromatic part of the molecule engaging in hydrophobic interactions with meth-
ylene groups of the alkyl tails residing near or at the aggregate ’ s surface. 87,88 
 Reaction rates in the presence of cationic surfactant aggregates can be successfully 
analyzed using the pseudophase model, providing the rate constants for reaction within 
the aggregate (for vesicles,  k ves , taking into account ion exchange processes  89 ). Generally, 
reaction rates increase with decreasing water penetration into the aggregate and with 
decreasing ﬂ uid - like character of the surface of the aggregate:

 The kinetics of the decarboxylation of 6 - NBIC has also been examined in liposome 
dispersions  83   and in spontaneously formed catanionic vesicles.  90 For equimolar mixtures 
of  n  - cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium  n - heptyl sulfate,  k ves 
(8.29  ×  10  − 4  s  − 1 ) is higher than that in pure CTAB ( k ves  =  6.76  ×  10  − 4  s  − 1 ). Part of this rate 
increase may be due to the large concentration of NaBr in the solution. 
 Cationic vesicles, for example those formed from di -  n - hexadecyldimethylammonium 
bromide (DHAB) accelerate the decarboxylation by a factor of about 1000 relative to 
pure water.  91   Dehydration of the carboxylate group at the binding sites is most likely the 
main factor behind the catalysis. Different isokinetic temperatures (obtained from linear 
plots of enthalpies  vs . entropies of activation) have been observed above and below the 
main phase transition temperature. These excellent isokinetic relationships indicate that 
the catalytic effects are caused by a single important interaction mechanism. 92 
 From the view point of encapsulation, the effects of additives on the nature of vesicular 
binding sites are of special interest. An important additive is, of course, cholesterol, 
that plays an important role in life processes. It exerts important effects on the biophysi-
cal properties of biomembranes including their ﬂ uidity and the formation of microdo-
mains but also on membrane proteins, thereby regulating their functions. Interestingly, 
there is compelling evidence that phospholipid bilayer systems can form distinct 
cholesterol - rich and cholesterol - poor domains. 93   Extensive differential scanning micro-
calorimetric studies on vesicles formed from both synthetic amphiphiles and phospholi-
pids have shown signiﬁ cant effects of cholesterol on the main phase transition 
temperature, governed by changes in bilayer packing.  94   Compensating enthalpy and 
entropy effects on melting were found and cholesterol also inﬂ uences the cooperativity 
of bilayer melting. 
 Coming back to the decarboxylation of 6 - NBIC, cholesterol was found to reduce  k ves 
for DHAB vesicles by a factor of 3 when at 50   mol % in the bilayer. As a result of its 
appreciable hydrophobic surface area, it penetrates signiﬁ cantly into the bilayer, thereby 
decreasing the inter - amphiphile interactions. Under these conditions, the hydration of the 
interface is increased, and the reactant is stabilized. On the other hand, for trehalose as 
the additive, the value of  k ves  is slightly increased. This is in accord with the notion that 
binding to the bilayer surface leads to replacement of water molecules from the vesicular 
interface with a concomitant destabilization of bound 6 - NBIC.

 16.2.2  The Kemp Elimination: Rate - limiting Proton Transfer 
 A bimolecular reaction, with a substrate that is structurally related, albeit uncharged, and 
rather similar to the one examined in the previous paragraph, is the Kemp elimination. It 
involves the rate determining hydroxide - ion induced deprotonation of 5 - nitrobenzisoxa-
zole (5 - NBI,  1 , Figure  16.5 ). The high solvent sensitivity of this reaction primarily 
depends on the reactivity of the OH  −  ion. 95   The more weakly the hydroxide ion is solvated, 
particularly in apolar, aprotic solvents, the stronger the base catalysis. For example, the 
bimolecular rate constant ( k 2 ) is even 457 times higher in ethanol than in water. In cationic 
micelles (such as formed from  n - C 12 PyrI, DTAB, CTAB, CTACl and OTACl) the organic 
substrate will bind close to the aqueous interface, participating in both hydrogen bonding 
and hydrophobic interactions.  96   But what are exactly the properties of this interfacial 
region as a reaction environment? Indeed,  k 2  is also about 400 times higher than in water, 
in accord with the about similar dielectric constants of ethanol and of the Stern region of 
the micelles. Plots of  k obs  vs . the surfactant concentration show the typical biphasic pattern 
for a bimolecular reaction with both substrates partitioning between the bulk aqueous and 
micellar pseudophase. Hydroxide - ion binding to the micelles depends on the ability of 
the hydroxide ion to replace the counterion of the cationic micelles. 
 A kinetic study was also performed in a variety of vesicular solutions (DDAB, DODAB, 
DODAC; [NaOH]  =  2.25  mM, 25  ° C). 96   Interestingly, the vesicles possess stronger cata-
lytic reaction environments than the micelles.  97 The rate - determining proton transfer from 
carbon to the hydroxide ion was accelerated up to 850 fold in di -  n - dodecyldimethylam-
monium bromide (DDAB) vesicles. This is evidence that the reaction sides are less 
aqueous than those in micelles, as anticipated. Application of the pseudophase model 
afforded the bimolecular rate constants in the vesicles ( k ves ). For the different vesicles, 
 k ves is signiﬁ cantly higher ( ca . 12 times for DODAB) than the second - order rate constant 
in water. This shows that the catalysis is due to both a medium effect and a concentration 
effect. It was assumed that there was a fast equilibrium for substrate binding to the inner 
and outer leaﬂ ets of the bilayer, in accord with the fact that no two - phase kinetics were 
found. 
 Vesicle catalysis followed the order DDAB    >  DODAC  >  DODAB, with  k max / k w values 
of about 850, 550, and 160, respectively. This looked an unexpected result because the 
rate constants did not respond in the usual way to an increasing chain length of the tails. 
But it was recognized that the high catalytic efﬁ ciency of DDAB with the shortest alkyl 
chains was the result of vesicles being in the liquid - crystalline state at the reaction

temperature while the other bilayers were in the gel state. A similar effect has been 
observed before  98 . 
 Addition of cholesterol leads to two counteracting effects on the rate constants. The 
ﬁ rst is a smaller counterion binding, reducing the rate constants. The other is a rate 
enhancing effect resulting from the less polar vesicular binding sides. The overall effect 
depends on the exact reaction conditions.  96 
 In a further detailed study the effects of several added long - tailed alcohols and  n - alkyl 
pyranosides were examined.  99   The overall results showed that minor structural changes 
in the additive and concentration of the additive exerted signiﬁ cant changes in the proper-
ties of the interfacial region and it was suggested that similar effects can be anticipated 
for the much more complex biological cell membranes. 
 Perhaps most interesting was the kinetic response upon addition of  n - dodecyl -  β -
 glucoside (C 12 Glu) and  n - dodecyl - β - maltoside (C 12 Mal). For C 12 Glu a rate increase was 
found, largely due to an increase of  k ves  since substrate binding (K s ) shows only a minor 
increase. Using a number of spectroscopic probes, the normalized polarity of the interfa-
cial region was estimated and the data indicated only a minor difference with bulk water.  99 
All evidence pointed to a partial dehydration of the interfacial reaction sites induced by 
C 12 Glu and a concomitant dehydration of the OH  −   ion. Therefore this effect was taken as 
the origin of the kinetic effects. 
 Addition of sodium di -  n  - decyl phosphate (DDP) to DODAB vesicles leads to the for-
mation of catanionic vesicles and rather drastic changes in the propertes of the interfacial 
region. Again the Kemp elimination was employed to probe these changes, in combina-
tion with cryo - electron microscopy, DSC, and measurements of the surface charge density 
and zeta - potentials. 97 Binding site polarties were assessed using Reichardt ’ s E T - 30 probe 
and pyrene. 
 Whereas for di - n  - octadecyldimethylammonium chloride (DODAB) vesicles  k ves is 
about 65 times larger than the water rate constant, addition of DDP decreases the vesicular 
catalysis. Experiments with the polarity probes indicated that the polarity of the bilayer 
surface hardly responded to addition of DDP and also the binding constant of 5 - NBI was 
not affected. It was argued that the reduction of the catalytic effect was due to a decrease 
in counterion binding resulting from addition of DDP. 97 Catalysis could be turned into 
rate inhibition as was observed for negatively charged vesicles containing 70   mol% DDP 
in the bilayer. Interestingly, DSC experiments revealed the presence of neutral microdo-
mains ( ‘ rafts ’ ) in case of 5 and 30  mol % DDP in the bilayer. 
 16.2.3  Bimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution 
 Another bimolecular single - step organic reaction which can be used to probe binding sites 
in vesicular aggregates is the S N 2 reaction of a series of aromatic alkylsulfonates (MNBS; 
AlkONs, Alk  =  Me, Et,  n - Pr,  n - Hex) with water (Figure  16.6 ). 100   Now the water is a 
nucleophile instead of a hydration agent as in the previous probe reactions. 
 The rates of these hydrolysis reactions (Nu   =   H 2 O) can be compared with nucleophilic 
substitution by bromide ions (Nu  =  Br  −  ). A kinetic study has been made of these reac-
tions in the presence of vesicles formed from synthetic amphiphiles, phospholipids, and 
mixtures of both types of amphiphiles.  100   Particular attention was paid to the effect of 
addition of  n - dodecyl -  β - glucoside (C 12 Glu) as a mimic for glycolipids. Kinetic data were

analyzed using the pseudo - phase model to afford rate constants for the S N - 2 process in 
the aqueous phase and in the vesicular pseudo - phase. The experimental data can be 
reconciled with the reactions occurring at the vesicle – water interphase, with the nature 
of the binding sites being modiﬁ ed by the presence of C 12 Glu. It was calculated that for 
vesicles containing 50   mol% of C 12 Glu, the vesicular surface is covered for about 34% 
by C 12 Glu. 
 Rate constants for the reactions in the presence of overall positively charged vesicles 
are about ten times larger than those in the absence of vesicles. The effect was ascribed 
to an increase in the reactivity of water. In case the water molecules at the vesicular 
interphase are in part replaced by the glucose groups of C 12 Glu, the catalytic efﬁ ciency 
of the vesicles decreases signiﬁ cantly. 
 The bimolecular rate constants for the reaction with bromide ions are smaller at the 
vesicular interphase, and independent of the presence of C 12 Glu. These results indicate 
that this reaction, not involving water as a reactant, is not sensitive towards partial dehy-
dration of the binding sites of the organic substrate.   
 16.3  Liposomal Encapsulation in Drug Delivery 
 Since the discovery of liposomal vesicles  9   it has been envisioned that the closed inner 
compartment of a vesicle can be used to trap potentially harmful substances or to protect 
unstable compounds from decomposition by shielding them from the outside.  101,102 Despite 
the high potential of liposomal formulations in drug delivery only a few applications 
have made it into approved therapeutic drugs. The key to success is the stability of the 
formulation and the ability to retain the encapsulated compound for a long time once it 
is loaded into a vesicle. The low solubility and high toxicity and/or unwanted site effects 
of many anti - cancer drugs make this class of compounds a logic choice for the use of 
encapsulation. Furthermore the discontinuous vascular blood vessels of tumours are leaky 
for small 200 – 1200   nm particles, and liposomes of 100 – 200   nm readily extravasate at the 
tumour site.  103

Molecular Encapsulation
 Efﬁ cient liposomal therapeutics also require long circulation times. Normal liposomes 
are cleared from the blood rapidly by the reticuloendothelial system, but circulation times 
can be easily increased by giving the liposomes a so - called stealth character.  104 Stealth 
liposomes are sterically stabilized by lipids with a long polyethylene glycol unit attached 
to the headgroup, usually phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).  105 
 Good encapsulations begin with vesicles in which any compound can be retained 
for a long time. One way to achieve this is by making the bilayer less permeable for 
the encapsulated compound. Although a phospholipid membrane is semipermeable, 
small molecules and monovalent ions can leak in and out, typical at a time span of 
hours. In the presence of serum, vesicles are usually more leaky than in buffer without 
serum albumin. Very often cholesterol is added to phospholipids vesicles to make them 
less permeable as was demonstrated by leakage experiments with carboxyﬂ uorescein 
(CF) and calcein.  106 Instead of membranes based on (phospho)lipids, the use of block 
copolymers, with the same basic architecture as lipids but with larger masses, that can 
form vesicles  107,108   (polymersomes) gains popularity.  109   Another way of making less 
permeable membranes, involves the use of newly discovered lipids like the laderanes 
from the anammoxosomes,  110,111   unique organelles in anammox bacteria, and multimethyl 
branched lipids from the membranes of archeabacteria.  112   Although results on their 
capabilities are limited at the moment,  113   the synthesis of these lipids became recently 
available   114 – 116   allowing large scale experiments on their possible usage as drug delivery 
capsules. 
 16.3.1  Encapsulated Drugs 
 One of the ﬁ rst encapsulated drugs that was reported was liposomal insulin for oral 
administration instead of the now used method of subcutaneous injection. Insulin, when 
administrated orally, is broken down in the digestive track, making it useless for sugar 
uptake from the blood. By encapsulation in bilayer vesicles the idea was that insulin could 
successfully be administrated orally. The shielding effect of the bilayer to prevent decom-
position could facilitate the delivery of intact insulin. The results, however, were incon-
sistent and an application was never launched. Although the basic idea was good, this 
method faced the major problems still involved in efﬁ cient encapsulation. To retain any 
encapsulated compound effectively is by making use of the low solubility limit of the 
compound either by itself or by gelating it with another compound.  117 This was nicely 
demonstrated for vesicles loaded with the anti - cancer drug doxorubicin or the antibiotic 
ciproﬂ oxacin. 118   Doxorubicin was actively loaded by a sulphate gradient.  119   Due to the 
low solubility of the precipitated doxorubicin (Figure  16.7 ) no leakage was observed even 
in serum containing media. On the other hand, ciproﬂ oxacin, with a much higher solubil-
ity limit leaked out of the vesicles on an hour ’ s time scale.  118 Doxorubicin - loaded vesicles 
are by now one of the best characterized liposomal drug formulations  120   approved for the 
treatment of several solid tumours. By encapsulation of the doxorubicin the effective dose 
could be increased whereas the large site effects, such as the breakdown of cardiac tissue, 
could be avoided. 121 
 Cisplatin is an effective and frequently used anti - cancer drug against a variety of solid 
tumours. The ﬁ rst trials of encapsulation faced the problem of low drug to lipid ratio due 
to the limited solubility of cisplatin resulting in low bioavailability. 122

437
 Effective encapsulation of cisplatin was achieved by multiple freeze thawing steps 
of neutral and cationic soluble cisplatin in the presence of anionic phospholipids like 
phosphatidylserine (PS).  123   By freezing the cisplatin is concentrated because the solute 
is expelled from the ice crystals. When the concentration limit is reached the neutral 
cisplatin, with the lowest solubility limit, aggregates followed by aggregation of 
positively - charged cisplatin when the solution further concentrates during the freezing. 
The negatively - charged PS collapses on the small particles resulting in small aggre-
gates covered by lipids.  124   In this way very high cisplatin to lipid ratios were achieved. 
 Today more than ten liposomal drug formulations have been approved for clinical 
use 125,126   and the number is growing. Ideally a liposomal encapsulated drug exhibits hardly 
any drug release in the blood plasma, but once at the designated site all its content should 
be released. 
 To trust only on mechanical instability by accumulation on a desired spot for the release 
of pay - load from vesicles is an imperfection of the system. By the incorporation of 
channel proteins in the bilayer of vesicles that can open or close upon a variety of 
signals 127   smart release of encapsulated substances is brought closer. Especially the modi-
ﬁ ed mechano - sensitive channel protein MscL  128,129   from Lactococcus lactis can be 
remotely controlled. The MscL can be modiﬁ ed to be responsive to light or pH  130 – 132 for 
the release of encapsulated compounds.

Molecular Encapsulation
 An alternative for encapsulation in vesicles is the use of low molecular weight hydro -
 gelators. Gels can retain solvents and solutes in the space between a dense network of 
intertwined ﬁ bres. Similar to encapsulated material by vesicles, gels can retain com-
pounds. Aqueous hydrogelators based on cyclohexyl - tris - amino acid can self - assemble 
in one direction through the establishment of H - bonds, leading to the formation of a ﬁ bre 
network and consequently macroscopic gels.  133   The formation of these gel networks was 
found to be independent from the self - assembly of phospholipids into vesicles which is 
driven by hydrophobic interaction. By encapsulating a gel network into liposomes (Figure 
 16.8 ) the advantages of both liposomes and gel networks can be combined in a single 
system. 134 
 Despite the high expectations only a handful of applications of liposome -  encapsulated 
drugs is available. Nevertheless the high potency of liposomes is still considered as very 
useful in this ﬁ eld and research is progressing.

clinique have already been successful using viral vectors for DNA trafﬁ cking 135 During 
the past decades, extensive research has been performed on the synthesis and testing of 
 non - viral vectors for delivering nucleic acids into living cells, both  in vitro and  in vivo . 
Examples include DOTMA ( N - (1 - (2,3 - dioleoyloxy)propyl) - N , N , N - trimethylammonium 
chloride), DOTAB ( n - dodecyl - trimethylammonium bromide), SAINT - 2 ( N - methyl - 4 -
 (dioleoyl)methylpyridinium chloride and sugar - based gemini surfactants. This work 
makes use of some of the most sophisticated applications of bilayer encapsulation. The 
vectors include cationic, bilayer - forming amphiphiles,  136 – 138   which are viewed as useful 
alternatives for virus - based delivery agents which may be associated with mutational and 
immunological hazards. These carriers are often used in combination with speciﬁ c phos-
pholipids. The transfection efﬁ ciencies of different commercially available cationic lipid -
 based transfection kits have been compared.  139   A number of biodegradable pyridinium 
amphiphiles have also been synthesized and exhibited remarkably high transfection 
efﬁ ciencies. 140 
 The literature on gene transfection is enormous and the results have been reviewed.  137,141,142 
We will focus here exclusively on nucleic acid encapsulation by vesicles and discuss 
some of the factors governing the interactions. The resulting lipoplexes may contain entire 
genes, (antisense) oligonucleotides  143 – 145   or RNA and small interference RNA (siRNA) 
and are in most cases obtained by adding the nucleic acid to preformed vesicles. 
 16.4.1  Lipoplex Formation 
 Lipoplex formation is very efﬁ cient (occurring on an ms time scale) with  cationic 
amphiphiles, indicating that the binding is primarily electrostatically driven. The ratio 
amphiphile/DNA is such that all negative charges of the DNA are involved in binding to 
positively charged headgroups of the amphiphiles, thereby leading to a concomitant con-
densation of DNA to a compact toroidal structure. There should be sufﬁ cient additional 
amphiphile to provide the lipoplex with an overall positive charge. These lipoplexes can 
then favorably interact with the negatively charged cell surface, for example with anionic 
proteoglycans. 
 Liposomes formed from natural phospholipids are either zwitterionic or carry a net 
negative charge. Using them as gene carriers, nucleic - acid binding must now rely mainly 
on entrapment into the aqueous pool of the liposomes. 
 There is compelling evidence that the efﬁ ciency of the delivery vehicle depends 
strongly on the ability of the lipoplex to interact with the cell surface, necessary for 
induction of transfer of the gene into the cellular interior. As will be discussed later, the 
cationic amphiphiles should possess the necessary properties for affecting transport  across 
the membrane and they should allow destabilization of the endosomal membrane and 
subsequent release of DNA into the cytosol for trafﬁ cking to the nuclear membrane. The 
latter step is a key factor in gene transfection. A variety of issues play a role here, 
including a favorable chemical constitution of the amphiphilic carrier, environmental 
factors, and intermingling of the vesicular phase of the lipoplex with selected phospholi-
pids that can provide endosomal membrane destabilization and a concomitant release of 
the bound DNA.  Endocytosis  is often considered to be the major entry pathway for this 
process. It has been shown that the complex internalization process can occur via the 
cholesterol - dependent clathrin - mediated pathway of endocytosis. 146,147 Evidence includes

the observation that transfection is greatly inhibited when plasma membrane cholesterol 
is depleted with methyl -   β - cyclodextrin whereas cell - association remains unchanged. 
 Then, when delivered into the cytosol, the gene has to ﬁ nd its way to the cell nucleus, 
the site where transcription and replication will occur. A detailed recent study showed 
the crucial importance of nuclear transcription efﬁ ciencies. 148   In fact there are many 
individual steps that make up the gene transfection and mechanistic studies are performed 
to identify these steps and to ﬁ nd ways to facilitate these steps. 
 16.4.2  Lipoplex Structure 
 Lipoplexes can have several morphologies each possessing different transfection efﬁ cien-
cies. 142   The most frequently encountered structural phase is lamellar (  Lc
α) in which the 
DNA is sandwiched between the lamellae (Figure  16.9 ), as indicated by high resolution 
cryo - electron microscopy and SAXS measurements  149   as well as by X - ray diffraction.  150 
Their average size is about 200   nm, allowing a few of these lipoplexes to ﬁ t within an 
endosomal compartment. Mixing the cationic carrier with the phospholipid DOPE (mole 
fraction  > 0.4) leads to formation of a highly curved mesomorphic morphology, in this 
case an inverted hexagonal structure (  HII
c ) containing DNA rods coated with a monolayer 
of the amphiphile arranged on a hexagonal lattice. This phase is the favourable one for 
inducing efﬁ cient release of the DNA cargo from an (early) endosomal compartment in 
vitro. The hydrophobic outer - surface of inverted hexagonal lipoplexes make them not 
suitable for  in vivo  use. It has also been established that the   HII
c  phase plays an important 
role in destabilizing the endosomal membrane, thereby inducing efﬁ cient translocation of 
DNA across the endosomal membrane into the cytosol. 151 
 The effect of the helper lipid on the lipoplex morphology depends on control of the 
spontaneous radius of curvature of the bilayers and is dependent on its mole fraction 
(mf) in the bilayer. For example, for DOTAB/DOPE cocktails, a pure lamellar phase is 
formed when mf(DOPE) is  < 0.41. A pure  HII
c  phase is formed when mf(DOPE) is  > 0.75,

whereas both morphologies coexist for 0.41  <  mf(DOPE)  <  0.75. Increasing mole frac-
tions of DOPE lead to gradual dehydation of the DNA bases. Transformation of DOTAP/
DOPE systems into the   HII
c  phase was evidenced by small angle X - ray scattering (SAXS) 
and optical microscopy.  152   For SAINT - 2/DOPE cocktails a similar phase change, but 
now at high salt concentrations, was shown by NMR spectroscopy and SAXS 
measurements. 153,145,154 
 The transition from   Lc
α to   HII
c  can be rationalized by considering the packing parameter 
P (section  16.1.1 ). For bilayer forming carrier molecules, P is between 0.5 and 1.0, often 
close to 1.0; by contrast the phospholipid DOPE is cone - shaped and P is    >  1, leading to 
a preferred formation of an inverted hexagonal phase. 
 There is evidence that a transient spaghetti - like morphology can be formed between 
the  Lc
α and  HII
c  phases, acting as a precursor to the  HII
c  morphology. 155 
 We like to emphasize here, that the efﬁ ciency of a helper lipid like DOPE is, however, 
inﬂ uenced by the packing of the alkyl tails in the membrane formed by the cationic carrier 
amphiphile. This was demonstrated 156 by a comparative study of two structurally related 
bilayer - forming surfactants, SAINT - 2 (with two C18:1 tails) and SAINT - 5 (with two 
C18:0 tails) (Figure  16.10 ). Both carriers display transfection activity, but DOPE exerts 
a positive effect on SAINT - 2 - mediated transfection, but has a negligible effect on trans-
fection mediated by SAINT - 5. Interestingly, DOPE effectively enhances DNA dissocia-
tion from the lipoplexes formed from both carriers. Most likely, membrane stiffness plays 
an important role here. Since the bilayer composed of SAINT - 5 is more rigid than that 
formed from SAINT - 2, because of the absence of unsaturation in the tails, the plasmid 
DNA becomes less effectively condensed, and the lipoplex is structurally deformed. This 
has no effect on cellular uptake but reduces the efﬁ ciency of translocation of the plasmid 
across the membranes of the endosome and/or of the cell nucleus.   
 In contrast with supercoiled DNA, steric factors most likely prevent translocation of 
the uncondensed DNA from the endosome into the cytosol. Consistent with this interpre-
tation, the much smaller oligonucleotides are effectively translocated into cells by lipo-
plexes formed from both SAINTs. In case the plasmid is stabilized by condensation with 
poly - l  - lysine, the transfection by SAINT - 5/DOPE is greatly improved. The observed 
phenomena illustrate that the structural shape of the plasmid is a substantial factor in

transfection processes. This factor has been considered previously but without reaching 
consensus.  157 
 A third morphology that has recently been identiﬁ ed is an intercalated hexagonal struc-
ture in which three honeycombs of amphiphile micelles cover the DNA rods, thereby 
forming a normal, hexagonal lattice (  HI
c). This was found for the two sugar - based gemini 
surfactants GS1 and GS2 (Figure  16.11 ), for which the lipoplex forms an   Lc
α phase at 
physiological pH values as indicated by cryo - EM and SAXS  158 measurements. The phase 
transition after internalization of the lipoplex into the endosomes with a mildly acidic pH 
was examined using the solvatochromic ﬂ uorescent probe Nile Red.  73   In the resulting   HI
c 
phase the polar headgroups of the geminis are exposed on the outside in contact with 
water. 159   This in contrast to the earlier proposed   HII
c  phase for the lipoplexes.  158 As a 
consequence, these particles exhibit an unusually high colloidal stability (as shown 
by turbidity measurements) facilitating their application in  in vivo  gene delivery 
experiments.  160   In the   HII
c  phase the polar headgroups of the amphiphile participate in

electrostatic interactions with the DNA and the hydrophobic tails are exposed on the 
outside where they can easily induce aggregation behaviour and capture in the lung 
endothelium capillaries. This problem has been tackled by coating the lipoplexes with 
PEG - lipids that enhance the blood circulation times. 
 In Figure  16.12  the morphology of the   HI
c phase is compared with that of the   HII
c  phase 
formed from SAINT - 2 and DOPE. A similar   HI
c phase has previously been reported for 
lipoplexes composed of the single - tailed, micelle - forming surfactant CTAB.  161 In this 
phase the amphiphile monomers are dynamic and able to move in and out of the micelles. 
These properties allow translocation of endosomal lipids into the lipoplex thereby stimu-
lating release of DNA into the cytosol. 
 Oligonucleotides (ODNs) can function as effective gene - speciﬁ c regulators and have 
considerable therapeutic potential. Although small quantities of ODNs can be endocyto-
sized via adsorption, it is necessary to prevent their sequestering in endocytic compart-
ments. It has been shown 144   that SAINT - 2 can act as an effective carrier for speciﬁ c 
antisense ODNs to target mRNA. No problems with cytotoxicity were found. Using

Molecular Encapsulation
corticotropin -  releasing factor were assessed. ODN release did not depend on the size of 
the lipoplex and the presence of serum. However, in case serum proteins are incorporated 
into the lipoplex, the lipoplex membrane is stabilized, hampering ODN release. 
 For  in vivo applications, the circulation time of the ODN - carrier complex has to be 
increased. This was accomplished for the same cell type by incorporating complexes of 
PEG with either phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or ceramide. 145 The data suggested that 
cytosolic release of the ODNs from the endosomal compartment was inhibited by the 
PEG - lipid through stabilization of the lamellar phase of the lipoplexes. For a more 
detailed discussion of this important ﬁ eld, the interested reader is referred to recent 
reviews. 162,143 
 Rather surprisingly, it was found possible to form a lipoplex from DNA and a zwit-
terionic multilamellar phase at high lipid/DNA weight ratios.  163   The impetus for these 
studies was the lower cytotoxicity of neutral (and also negatively charged) liposomes. 
Encapsulation of DNA by soya bean diacylphosphatidylcholine (PC) was carried out by 
mixing the lipid (containing a small amount of a helper surfactant) and short DNA frag-
ments ( ca . 150 base pairs) in excess water and subsequent freeze - drying. The resulting 
dry powder was then hydrated with deionized water. SAXS measurements on these 
systems were in accord with a multilamellar structure with intercalated monolayer DNA 
between the neutral lipid layers, despite the absence of electrostatic binding interactions. 
The absence of signiﬁ cant DNA - lipid interactions was experimentally veriﬁ ed and as a 
consequence the DNA molecules possess more motional freedom than in the conventional 
 Lc
α complexes formed from cationic carrier systems. 
 Another remarkable lipoplex morphology was proposed in experiments in which short 
DNA fragments (either pure or marked with a ﬂ uorescent dye) were locally injected, using 
a micropipette, into a part of the membrane of a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV, diameter 
 ca . 100  µ m). These vesicles were formed from phosphatidylcholines and upto 33   mol% 
of a cationic sphingosine by electroformation. 164 Membrane topology was observed in 
phase contrast, DNA distributions by ﬂ uorescence spectroscopy. Local DNA - lipid inter-
actions in the membrane induced endocytosis, which needed a minimum concentration 
of D - erythrosphingosine. At lower concentrations only lateral adhesions between neigh-
boring vesicles were found upon local addition of DNA. The size and shapes of the 
endosomes were dependent on the kind of DNA and the initial GUV membrane tension. 
 Although the evidence was not fully compelling, it was suggested that DNA - lipid 
interactions involved DNA encapsulation within a cylindrical inverted micelle, included 
in the lipid membrane (Figure  16.13 ). 
 Gene expression was veriﬁ ed in cell - sized, giant vesicles formed from DOPC/DOPG 
(10   :   1). In individual vesicles expression was found of red - shifted green ﬂ uorescent 
protein (rsGFP) using ﬂ uorescence spectroscopy. 165   Particularly in the early stage of the 
reaction, expression inside the vesicle was signiﬁ cantly higher than that in bulk aqueous 
solution. Interestingly, the rsGFP synthesized in the vesicles is protected from attack by 
proteinase K that was added to the external aqueous medium. 
 A lot of work has been done to ﬁ nd out how lipoplexes and lipoplex - cell interactions 
respond to the presence of serum. Many relevant references are cited in a paper published 
in 2002  166   that reports how lipoplex stability and processing are affected by serum. The 
cationic surfactant carrier was SAINT - 2 using DOPE as the helper lipid. Previous studies 
had already shown that transfection efﬁ ciencies are reduced in the presence of serum, in

Molecular Encapsulation
accord with the results for SAINT - 2 lipoplexes. In the absence of serum, clustered lipo-
plexes (  −  FBS lipoplexes, FBS is fetal bovine serum) were observed. Clustering did  not 
occur in the presence of serum ( + FBS lipoplexes) or when serum was present during 
lipoplex formation (FBS lipoplexes). Interestingly, the topology of DNA in FBS lipo-
plexes changes from a supercoiled conformation (as also in   −  FBS lipoplexes) to a pre-
dominantly open - circular conformation. This leads to faster digestion by DNase. Most 
signiﬁ cant was the observation that internalization of   −  FBS and  + FBS lipoplexes is about 
three times slower than that of FBS lipoplexes although their transfection efﬁ ciencies are 
about ﬁ ve times higher. The data indicate that smaller serum protein - penetrated particles 
cannot fast enough release their DNA from pre - lysosomal endocytic compartments and 
are delivered to lysosomes where they are prone to degradation pathways. Size and mor-
phology of the lipoplex govern their ability to interact with and perturb cell membranes, 
processes that are needed for release of the gene. Serum regulates these processes in an 
amphiphile - dependent manner through complex  ‘ penetration ’  and modulation of the DNA 
conformation.  
 16.4.3  Future Prospects 
 It will be clear that DNA encapsulation by vesicles is the starting point for gene transfec-
tion. In a complex follow - up, DNA is ﬁ nally transported to the cell nucleus. The variety 
of factors determining transfection efﬁ ciencies, including lipoplex size and zeta potential, 
incubation time, cytotoxicity and lipoplex morphology, both  in vitro  and  in vivo , are still 
under active investigation. The ﬁ nal goal is a successful and safe application in the cli-
nique. Our attention here was only focused on lipoplex formation, their structure and 
properties. The results obtained so far overwhelmingly show the complex features of 
DNA encapsulation by the cationic amphiphilic carrier systems. Insight into these issues 
as embedded in a realistic mechanistic picture of the whole transfection process might 
ultimately give the desired success.

 17.1  Introduction 
 Compartmentalized reactions belong to a class of molecular reacting systems, which play 
a fundamental role in our understanding of cellular life. In fact, the most striking property 
of living systems is their cellular nature, and the fact that life is based on reactions that 
are organized by a functional as well as spatial point of view. In the last decades, cellular 
biology has provided a great amount of evidences about the structure and dynamics of 
living cells, by  in vivo  or  ex vivo  investigations. Such approach  –  that can be deﬁ ned as 
 ‘ analytical ’   –  has been germane to our comprehension of several mechanisms, but is, in 
some aspects, not sufﬁ cient. There are two reasons that lie at the basis of modern studies 
on compartmentalized reactions: the ﬁ rst is related to the need of a complementary 
approach, that we may call  ‘ synthetic ’ or  ‘ constructive ’ , 1 – 3   since it tries to understand 
cells by constructing more or less elaborated models of them. This point of view can be 
summarized by the famous Feynman ’ s sentence  ‘ What I cannot create, I do not under-
stand ’ . The second reason is related to the tradition of artiﬁ cial life and origins of life 
studies, where great efforts have been carried out to produce synthetic analogues of living 
cells, or to reproduce  –  at least as proof of principle  –  the steps that led to the transition 
from inanimate matter to the ﬁ rst living protocell. It is within this conceptual framework 
that the study of reactions in compartments (and inside lipid vesicles, in particular) have

currently witnessed an enormous rise of interest, that has also catalyzed an ever - growing 
number of scientists involved in such research. Synthetic biology,  4 – 6 a new - born subject 
that combines molecular biology with an engineering approach, can be perhaps consid-
ered as the proper ﬁ eld where microcompartmentalized reactions belong to, even if some 
conceptual differences have been pointed out.  1,3   More in general, however, we can look 
at these studies as investigations on molecular self - organization and on the physical -
 molecular basis of living process. 
 In this chapter, we will introduce the basic concepts of reactions inside vesicles, 
describing ﬁ rst the self - assembly nature of lipid and fatty acid vesicles, which are very 
important cell models (it has been suggested that fatty acid vesicles represent the most 
plausible candidates for protocells). Then, the experimental strategies and some theoreti-
cal aspects will be presented and discussed, in order to give a general view on the subject. 
In the last part, we will discuss some speciﬁ c examples of reactions in liposomes, giving 
much emphasis to the technical advancements and open questions, but commenting also 
on the relevance of such studies for synthetic biology and origins of life. More in particu-
lar, we will focus on the issue of  ‘ semi - synthetic minimal cell ’ , 7   that we  –  and others  – are 
currently pursuing and developing. 
 17.2  Lipid Vesicles (Liposomes) 
 17.2.1  What are Liposomes (and Fatty Acid Vesicles) 
 Lipid vesicles (namely, liposomes), as well as fatty acid vesicles, form spontaneously in 
aqueous solution by a self - assembly process. The building blocks of liposomes are natural 
or synthetic phospholipids (Figure  17.1 A), which are water - insoluble amphiphilic mol-
ecules formed generally by two hydrophobic chains and a polar (charged) headgroup. The 
formation of bilayers by phospholipids is qualitatively predicted by geometrical consid-
erations based on the so - called surfactant parameter.  8   In the case of fatty acids (Figure 
 17.1 B), bilayers form only within a determined pH range (for oleic acid vesicles, around 
pH 8.5    ±    1 pH unit), because the protonation state of the carboxylate group strongly 
affects the self - assembly properties of such molecules. At high pH, fatty acids, being 
deprotonated, assemble as micelles; at low pH, fatty acids separate from the solution as 
oil droplets. At intermediate pH values, fatty acids and their salts coexist in the membrane, 
which results stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds.  9   The fact that fatty acids assem-
ble as bilayers at intermediate pH and as micelles at high pH can be viewed and explained 
as a change of surfactant parameter (from cylidrical to conical shape). Phospholipid vesi-
cles and fatty acid vesicles have several common properties, but differ in some key 
aspects: for example, both form only above critical aggregate concentrations (typically 
10  − 10    M for phospolipids, and around 10  − 4 – 10  − 2    M for fatty acids, depending on their chain 
length). Fatty acids, in fact, are more soluble than phospholipids, due to their molecular 
structure, which presents only one hydrophobic chain instead of two, and a polar and 
exposed ionic head group. This difference affects also the molecular dynamics of the 
systems: phospholipid membranes are more  ‘ frozen ’ , whereas fatty acid membranes are 
more  ‘ dynamic ’ . 
 It is important to remark that the formation of membrane bilayers is guided by the 
entropically driven hydrophobic effect.  10   Spherical or spheroidal liposomes, which form

by different mechanisms,  11   differ in their size and morphology, mainly depending on the 
chemical nature of lipids, physico - chemical parameters (temperature, ionic strenght, pH, 
etc), and also according to the method of liposome preparation, as will be discussed later. 
In Figure  17.2 , some typical size/shape of liposomes are shown. 
 Two important aspects of liposome formation must be emphasized here. First, in some 
cases we observe the formation of ordered supramolecular structures starting from a 
chaotic disordered mixture of surfactants (as in the ethanol injection method  12 ). As noticed 
before, this increase of order is attended by a simultaneous increase of water entropy and 
a decrease of overall free energy (lipids  and  solvent). Secondly, every time a liposome 
forms, there is the  ‘ emergence ’  of a division, with an inside world that is different from 
the external environment, even if the two worlds actually interact with each other. The 
discrimination between inside and outside, applicable to lipid vesicles, is the ﬁ rst struc-
tural pre - requisite for the living cell. It is therefore clear that lipid or fatty acid vesicles 
may be considered relevant experimental model of simpliﬁ ed cells, and their role on

(A); oleic acid/oleate dimer (through hydrogen bond) (B); oleate (C). The values of 
surfactant parameters are shown on the right, as well as the approximate surfactant shape. 
Surfactants with cylindrical geometry ( p  ∼  1) generally form bilayer, and therefore vesicles; 
surfactants with conical geometry ( p  <  0.5) generally form micelles. Notice that oleate 
may have different  p values according to the pH. When the ionization degree is about 
50%, oleate bilayers are stabilized by a network of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Other 
fatty acids behave similarly

origins of life is today greatly acknowledged. Further discussion on the emergence of 
compartments and their relevance to the origins of life, can be ﬁ nd in Luisi (2006). 1 
 17.2.2  Morphology and Methods of Preparation 
 Liposomes can be prepared according to different methods. Classical discussions  11,13 focus 
on the preparation of phospholipid vesicles, whereas the preparation of fatty acid vesicles 
has been reviewed only recently. 14 
 The key point is that different preparation methods produce different vesicle samples, 
in terms of size, morphology and size distribution (this observation provides a further 
conﬁ rmation on the non - equilibrium nature of vesicle samples). A collection of vesicle 
types is shown in Figure  17.2 . Unilamellar vesicles (UVs) are generally classiﬁ ed as 
small, large or giant ones (SUVs, LUVs, or GUVs, respectively); SUVs have very small 
diameters ( < 50  nm), whereas LUVs ’  diameters span from 50 to about 400   nm. Notice that 
it is difﬁ cult to produce large vesicles which are truly unilamellar; very often they are 
bi -  or oligo - lamellar. Giant vesicles are very large vesicles ( > 1  µ m) that can be visualized 
by a light microscope; they are generally oligo -  or multilamellar, but thanks to special 
methods, 15   it is possible to produce GUVs. Unilamellar vesicles are the most useful vesi-
cles since the dependence of their properties from the number of lamella has been elimi-
nated. As a consequence, it is expected that their physico - chemical properties depend 
mainly from their size. Moreover, diffusion of solutes inside unilamellar vesicles is 
simpler than in other cases, and can be therefore clearly explained. Unfortunately, most 
 Figure 17.2   Size and morphology of vesicles. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) are 
generally small ( < 50  nm); large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) have size between 50   nm and 
few hundreds nanometers; multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) have an indeﬁ nite number of 
concentric lamellae and are generally larger than LUVs; multivesicular vesicles (MVVs) are 
formed by several smaller vesicles (uni - , oligo - , or multilamellar) within the cavity of a 
larger (uni - , oligo - , or multilamellar) vesicle. Giant vesicles are very large vesicles (in the 
micrometer range) of various lamellarity. If unilamellar, they are called giant unilamellar 
vesicles (GUVs). It is often impossible to ﬁ x a size limit to each vesicle class; different size 
and morphologies are often possible

of the common preparation methods  –  as we will see later  –  do not produce unilamellar 
vesicles. The typical outcome of lipid hydration procedures is a sample of oligo - or mul-
tilamellar vesicles (OLVs, MLVs), or more complex structures as multivesicular vesicles 
(MVVs). Such particles, which have a variable morphology and an unpredictable number 
of lamellae can be used for some applications, but in most reﬁ ned studies are ﬁ rst con-
verted into unilamellar ones. It is remarkable that unilamellar vesicles have of course 
higher total entrapped volume when compared to OLVs, MLVs, or MVVs of same size, 
since the architecture of each compartment involves the smallest possible lipid quantity, 
and therefore the number of compartments is higher than the opposite case (in MLVs, 
several lipid bilayer are  ‘ wasted ’  to build the compartment boundary). It is therefore clear 
that unilamellar vesicles are the preferred containers to carry out microcompartmentalized 
reactions. 
 Let us discuss brieﬂ y the main preparation methods of phospholipid vesicles (Figure 
 17.3 ). The formation of vesicles takes place when lipids are dispersed in water; the dif-
ferent methods differ for the way this dispersion occurs.  
 In the thin ﬁ lm hydration method, lipids are ﬁ rst stratiﬁ ed on a very large surface, in 
order to make a very thin ﬁ lm (generally in a round - bottom glass ﬂ ask). Within the thin 
ﬁ lm, which form by evaporation from a lipid/solvent solution, lipids are already organized 
as bilayers. After hydration of the ﬁ lm, large vesicle (MLVs) arise, entrapping solvent 
and solutes in their aqueous core and between lamellae. Vesicles are then processed in 
order to reduce lamellarity and size, to produce SUVs or LUVs. This process is generally 
done by freezing and thawing the vesicles in liquid nitrogen, followed by extrusion; 
alternatively, and at the same aim, vesicles can also be treated with ultrasounds. If the 
lipid ﬁ lm is done on rod electrodes, and hydration is accomplished by applying alternate 
voltage, GUVs emerge from the electrodes surface.  15,16 
 The reverse - phase evaporation method 17 starts from water - in - oil (w/o) compartments, 
obtained by dispersing a small amount of an aqueous solution (the same that needs to be 
entrapped in the vesicles) in a lipid - containing solution, such an ether/chloroform solu-
tion. Lipids stabilize the formation of such droplets. After solvent evaporation the com-
partments collapse to give ﬁ rst a gel and then a dispersion of uni -  and oligolamellar 
vesicles, with size ranging from 100 to 500   nm. The advantage of this method is the high 
entrapment yield (notice that the starting point is already a  ‘ 100% inside ’ compartmental-
ized state); the disadvantage is the use of organic solvents, which may be dangerous for 
some solutes (e.g. folded proteins). 
 The detergent depletion method also starts from a special organization form: the mixed 
micelles. When lipids are mixed with excess detergent in aqueous solution, lipids are 
 ‘ solubilized ’  in the detergent micelles. When detergent is slowly removed by gel ﬁ ltration 
chromatography or dialysis, the mixed micelles transform into phospholipid vesicles. The 
method works because the detergent molecules are also present as monomer, in equilib-
rium with the micelle, and the exchange of aqueous phase brings to a slow detergent 
depletion via monomer removal. The method produces SUVs or LUVs, entrapping the 
solutes present in the aqueous phase used to remove the detergent. The high concentration 
of detergents, often needed during the preparation step, may be a disadvantage when 
sensitive solutes must be entrapped. 
 With the ethanol (or methanol) injection method  12   a small aliquot of an alcoholic lipid 
solution (where lipids are likely present as monomer species) is simply injected into a

 Figure 17.3   Four classical methods of liposome preparation. (I) Thin ﬁ lm hydration 
method. Lipids are solubilized in apolar solvents (chloroform, ether) and stratiﬁ ed as dry 
thin ﬁ lm on a solid support (generally glass). After hydration and shaking, liposomes form 
(very often MLVs MVVs). Formation of GVs by natural swelling method also require the 
formation of stratiﬁ ed lipids on the wall of container; GVs electroformation starts from 
stratiﬁ ed lipids on electrodes; (II) Reverse phase evaporation. To a solution of lipids in 
chloroform/ether, a small aliquot of aqueous phase is added and sonicated, in order to 
form a water - in - oil emulsion. After controlled solvent evaporation, a gel form, that 
collapses upon vortexing to a suspension of vesicles. The overall process leads to high 
entrapment yields. Intermediate - size vesicles are often formed. (III) Detergent depletion 
method. A solution of mixed micelles (lipid plus excess detergent) is processed so that the 
detergent amount is reduced, by dialysis, gel ﬁ ltration chromatography or by dilution. 
Liposomes form slowly due to the low ﬁ nal detergent/lipid ratio. Typically, SUVs or LUVs 
are generated. This method is often used to reconstitute membrane proteins in liposomes, 
starting from mixed micelles containing a membrane protein. (IV) Ethanol injection 
method. A small aliquot (1 – 5% v/v) of a lipid solution in ethanol or methanol in injected 
in an aqueous solution. Liposomes form immediately due to ethanol dilution in water 
phase. The liposome size depends on the lipid concentration in alcohol. Working with 
diluted solution, it is possible to form SUVs. In all methods, liposomes entrap the water -
 soluble compounds that present in the aqueous solution. High entrapment yields are 
obtained by rehydrating freeze - dried liposomes. This method is reminescent of method I, 
but starts from lipid preorganized in different way (freeze - dried liposomes probably have 
partially conserved lipid bilayers)

large amount of aqueous solution, containing the solute(s) to be entrapped. Ethanol mixes 
with water and liposome forms within the mixing time. Interestingly, such method pro-
vides a one - step way to form unilamellar vesicles (SUVs or LUVs), and the main factor 
governing the size and morphology of resultant vesicles is the lipid concentration in 
ethanol. 18,19   The presence of ethanol (or methanol) in the ﬁ nal dispersion may be disad-
vantageous, but in many cases it is limited to few units percent. 
 In addition to these classical methods, two special methods must be mentioned, due to 
their advantageous entrapment yield. The ﬁ rst is based on the rehydration of freeze - dried 
liposomes, which are in turn prepared from  ‘ empty ’  liposomes or from liposomes that 
already contain the solute(s) of interest.  20 – 22 Upon rehydration, freeze - dried vesicles 
reform and entrap the solute in high concentration. The second is a new method for pro-
ducing GVs starting from large w/o emulsion droplets, which are centrifuged through a 
lipid - rich macroscopic oil – water interface. The w/o droplets become covered with an 
external lamella during the passage through the oil – water interface, and are transformed 
into GVs, with the advantage of keeping inside their content.  23   Many of the most recent 
works on biocomparmentalized reactions are carried out in lipid vesicles formed by the 
latter two methods. 
 Fatty acid vesicles, which are stable only in a rather restricted pH range, can be pre-
pared: (1) by direct dispersion of fatty acids or their salts in an aqueous phase; (2) by the 
ﬁ lm method (when feasible); or (3) by acidiﬁ cation of an alkaline fatty acid salt micelles 
solution. In general, all preparation methods lead to a heterogeneous vesicle population; 
in special conditions, however, a narrowly sized vesicle population can be obtained by 
an autocatalytic process. 24,25 
 As a ﬁ nal remark, it is clear that the choice of liposome preparation method depends 
on the experiment ’ s aim. Since we are dealing with compartmentalized reactions, it is 
often convenient to reach the maximum entrapment efﬁ ciency, in order to have  ‘ ﬁ lled ’ 
vesicles. We will see in next section what are the general strategies to entrap chemicals 
inside vesicles, and how to feed them with an externally added reactant. Another impor-
tant issue, discussed below, is the chemical compatibility between the lipids, the prepara-
tion method, and the (bio)chemicals used in the experiments. 
 We conclude this survey on vesicle preparation methods by noticing that there are not 
standard method to prepare unilamellar vesicles in the range 0.5 – 1  µ m, although this size 
would be rather convenient for carrying out compartmentalized reactions (large trapped 
volume, possibility to employ modern visualization techniques, or high - throughput 
techniques). 
 17.2.3  Chemical Compatibility 
 There are two aspects pertinent to chemical compatibility and the design and the realiza-
tion of reactions inside vesicles. The ﬁ rst concerns the chemical structure of lipids (or 
fatty acids, or other co - surfactants, as ammonium salts, derivatized lipids, or sterols), the 
second is related to the preparation method. 
 Among phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) is certainly the less reactive, 
whereas anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and 
phosphatidic acid are of course sensitive to cations (e.g., Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ; phosphatidic acid 
is sensitive to H +  too), to polyamines (spermine, spermidine, etc.), or basic proteins. Fatty

acids vesicles, stable at weakly alkaline pH, are also negatively charged, and therefore 
sensitive to H +  (a pH increase or decrease transform fatty acid vesicles into micelles and 
oil droplets, respectively), to divalent cations, and to basic proteins.  26 The latter point 
deserves a particular mention since it may prevent the use of fatty acid vesicles as com-
partment for Mg 2+  - dependent biochemical reactions. To date, the best way to make fatty 
acid vesicles compatible with such kind of chemicals is the addition of fatty acids –
 glycerol monoesters. 27,28   Cationic surfactant, generally based on ammonium salts, may be 
not compatible with anionic solutes (calcein, a classical water - soluble negatively charged 
probe used in vesicle research, interact with some cationic surfactant), and with poly-
anions like RNAs and DNAs. It has been recently reported that cell - free protein expres-
sion is inhibited by cationic liposomes 29 in a dose - dependent manner. 
 The preparation method may also present some constrains. For example, the thin ﬁ lm 
hydration is the only method which does not require the presence of additional compounds 
(reverse phase evaporation is carried out in the presence of organic solvents; the detergent 
depletion in the presence of detergent; and the ethanol injection, in the presence of 
ethanol) and it is therefore the only method of general use. However, it requires additional 
steps for vesicle processing because it produces a heterogeneous population of large 
MLVs. The reverse phase evaporation method, which is very convenient in terms of 
entrapment efﬁ ciency (10 – 40%), suffers of the presence of organic solvents, so that pro-
teins or other bio - supramolecular complex may lose their activity. Such preparation 
method, however, is applicable to inorganic or simple organic reactions. Similar consid-
erations apply to detergent - based methods and ethanol injection procedures. It has been 
reported that ethanol (3.5% v/v) and methanol (5% v/v) halves the yield of cell - free 
protein expression. 30 
 In conclusion, chemical compatibilities must be considered at the very beginning in 
the process of designing a microcompartmentalized bioreactor, and this will affect the 
choice of lipids as well as the preparation procedure.   
 17.3  Experimental Strategies and Theoretical Aspects 
 17.3.1  Basic Strategies 
 The result of the preparative methods sketched above is a vesicle suspension, where 
individual vesicles may or may not contain the solute(s) of interest. We should now 
perform a reaction inside the vesicle, and at this point, two different approaches must be 
distinguished. One is the case where the resulting vesicles still miss one (or more) 
reactant(s) necessary for the reaction under study (Figure  17.4 A), whereby the missing 
reactant(s) is deliberately not included in the hydrating solution. The other is the case 
where all reactants are present in the hydrating solution, so that fully  ‘ functional ’ vesicles 
may be present in the sample (Figure  17.4 B). In the ﬁ rst case the compartmentalized 
reaction cannot start until the missing reactant is added; in the second case, when all 
reactants are provided from the beginning, one must ﬁ nd some way so that the reaction 
does not start right away, namely it should start only when the compartmentation of all 
components has taken place. Notice, in fact, that in order to follow the reaction inside 
vesicles, in both strategies, the external  – the non - entrapped  –  material should be removed, 
destroyed or inhibited.

Reactions in Liposomes 
463
 Let us discuss a general case where the reaction under study is modeled by the equation 
X  +  Y  →  Z. 
 The strategy indicated in Figure  17.4 A involve the vesicle formation in the presence 
of the reactant X (let us suppose, for the sake of simplicity; that X is a single chemical 
species). Depending on the conditions, not all vesicles may contain X, and certainly the 
numerical distribution of X inside the vesicles is centered around an average value, so 
that vesicles should be considered heterogeneous in terms of internal composition. We 
will discuss this theoretical aspect later. The ﬁ rst step is the removal of free (the non 
encapsulated) X from the system, and this is generally accomplished by dialysis, gel 
ﬁ ltration chromatography, ultracentrifugation or ultraﬁ ltration. For successful procedures, 
the external X and the vesicles are separated from each other due to different physical 
properties, such as molecular weight, size, or density. An alternative strategy involves 
the addition of a component that is able to inhibit the external (and only the external) 
reaction. 
 Now, in order to make the reaction possible, the second reactant Y must be added. In 
Figure  17.4 A it is shown the addition of Y in the external phase, followed by the diffusion 
of Y inside the vesicles. The ﬁ nal state is the product Z, synthesized inside the vesicle. 
This way is the simplest one, but requires that the Y permeability coefﬁ cient differs from 
zero. Moreover, if the entrance of Y in the vesicles becomes rate - limiting, the observed 
reaction rate will be limited by this slow step. 
 Figure 17.4   Two general strategies to carry out a compartmentalized reaction 
 ‘ X   +  Y  =  Z ’ . (A) Liposomes are formed in the presence of X, which is entrapped; then the 
free (unentrapped) X is removed, and later the second reactant Y is added. (B) Liposomes 
are formed in the presence of reactants X and Y, unentrapped material is removed (or a 
not - permeant inhibitor is added). The reaction is then started by physical means (e.g., 
temperature, light). X and Y may represent a single chemical specie, or a collection of 
reactants. When two or more reactants are simultaneously entrapped, the issue of 
 composition  of individual liposome may become relevant for interpretation of data. In 
panel B, for example, not all liposomes contain  both X and Y (this condition may become 
critical for a large number of reactants)

Molecular Encapsulation
 Figure  17.5  shows some possibilities, alternative to the passive diffusion (Figure 
 17.5 .1). The diffusion of Y into a vesicle which contains already X is useful when the 
permeability of Y is much higher than X ’ s one. A typical example is the entrapment of 
an enzyme inside vesicles, and the addition of its substrate(s)  –  generally small molecules 
 –  from outside. For a review on enzymes inside vesicles, strategies, and applications, 
see. 31 
 Fusion among two or more vesicles, each containing different solutes, can be a way to 
reach the desired reactant mixtures (Figure  17.5 .2). Vesicles can fuse under the effect of 
electrostatic forces (as in the case of cationic and anionic vesicles  32,33  ), or by some bridg-
ing agent such as Ca 2+ for phosphatidylserine vesicles, 34 or dehydrating agents like 
poly(ethylenglycol).  35   Although fusion rarely occurs at high yield, the idea of using 
vesicle fusion to build artiﬁ cial cells has been already suggested  1,36   and recently imple-
mented by means of fusogenic peptides. 37 
 The technique of microinjection (Figure  17.5 .3) bypasses the problem of low mem-
brane permeability, or even the entire entrapment step, by direct injecting the reactants 
inside GVs. This technique has been used in combination with GVs electroformation, as 
an approach to minimal cells. 16

Reactions in Liposomes 
465
 Another method relies on thermal properties of lipid membranes. Every lipid bilayer 
is characterized by a phase transition, from solid - like to liquid - like states. It is known that 
at the transition temperature (called  ‘ melting ’  temperature,  T m ), the bilayer permeability 
is maximal.  38   It is then possible to exploit this higher permeability to allow solutes pass 
through the membrane (Figure  17.5 .4). It has been reported, for example, that ATP per-
meability increase by a factor  ∼ 100 in dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles,  39 and 
that such vesicles can therefore be fed with ATP by keeping them at the  T m (23.3  ° C). It 
has been suggested that membrane defects are involved in the mechanism of enhanced 
permeability. Recent applications of this method have been reported.  40,41 This physical 
principle can be generalized  –  for instance  –  as thermal cycles around  T m . 42 Notice that 
the application of freeze - thawing cycles (in liquid nitrogen) is a common laboratory 
practice for equalizing internal and external liposome content. Although it likely proceeds 
by rough membrane integrity destruction, the concept of permeation of solute through 
 ‘ damaged ’  membrane is somehow similar to the case of permeation at the melting point. 
 Another possible way to reduce the barrier to free diffusion provided by lipid bilayer 
involves the use of detergents at sub - lytic concentrations, as membrane dopants (Figure 
 17.5 .5). An example is given by the cholate - induced ADP  43 or glucose - 1 - phosphate 
entrance 44 inside 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - phosphatidylcholine (POPC) vesicles. For example, 
the permeability of ADP can be increased by a factor 10, when cholate/POPC   =   4/5 (mol/
mol). 
 Finally, a more elaborate molecular approach has been recently developed, as shown 
in Figure  17.5 .6. It makes use of natural pore - forming molecules, such as porins,  45 – 48 or 
 α - hemolysin. 49 
 The advantage of such approach is the possible selective effects deriving from the 
molecular weight cut - off, set by the pore size. It is then possible that small molecules 
may penetrate and react into the vesicles, whereas large macromolecules (such as enzymes, 
nucleic acids) are retained inside. 
 After this discussion on the methods to feed vesicles by externally added reactants, let 
us focus again of Figure  17.4 B where an alternative way to the ﬁ rst route (Figure  17.4 A) 
is shown: the encapsulation  –  from the beginning  –  of all required reactants inside vesi-
cles. As in the previous case (Figure  17.4 A), the ﬁ rst step is the removal of external 
reactants, or the inhibition of external reaction. Notice that this step becomes now critical, 
since all reactants are present in the vesicles  as well as  in the external phase. It is clear 
that such approach can be followed only if there is a way to trig the reaction by some 
physical mean. A classical example is the vesicle entrapment of the whole biochemical 
machinery for transcription and translation reactions (from DNA to messenger RNA, and 
from messenger RNA to protein, respectively). The reactions do not proceed at any sig-
niﬁ cant extent at low temperatures (0 – 5  ° C) and can be triggered by incubating the sample 
at 37  ° C. Then the sample, kept at low temperature, is quickly manipulated by adding an 
inhibitor (that is not capable to enter the vesicle), or by exchanging the external phase by 
spin column gel chromatography, and later incubated at high temperature. In addition to 
this example of thermal trig, when possible, photochemical triggering can also be an 
opportunity. 
 The ﬁ nal step of every experiment with compartmentalized reactions is the product 
detection. This depends on the nature of the products, and in some cases by those of the 
reactants. It is evident that any analytical technique can be used in this respect, and direct 
chemical analysis should be preferred. When, however, real - time analysis is required,

only non - destructive methods can be applied, and in this respect the use of optical methods 
is very intriguing, but it also requires some caution. Lipid and fatty acid vesicles, in fact, 
strongly interfere with the spectrophotometric or spectroﬂ uorimetric detection of analytes. 
The discussion of this issue lies outside the purpose of this chapter, and the reader is 
referred to specialized literature. 
 17.3.2  Theoretical Aspects 
 In this section we will discuss brieﬂ y some theoretical aspects related to the design and 
realization of compartmentalized reactions, mainly derived from our experience with 
biochemical systems. As a general premise, we remark that although an ever increasing 
number of published work on this subject (mono -  or multi - enzymatic reactions inside 
liposomes, fatty acid vesicles, polymersomes,  50,51   as well as w/o  52   or w/o/w compart-
ments 53 ) a full understanding of the physico - chemical details of compartmentalized reac-
tions has not been reached. A related ﬁ eld, which has a longer tradition, i.e. that one of 
enzymes in reverse micelles has revealed interesting compartmentation - dependent 
mechanisms.  54 
 The main question is if  –  and to what extent  –  a reaction occurring inside a micrometric 
or submicrometric compartments differs from the same reaction in the bulk, and whether 
the formation of the compartment itself brings about novel effects. Clearly, these theoreti-
cal questions have great relevance in basic science, since the basic unit of life is itself a 
compartment (the biological cell), as well as in applications of compartmentalized systems 
for biotechnology (e.g. artiﬁ cial cells, biosensors, etc.). 55 
 We have recently discussed some of these theoretical issues in a publication.  36 Here 
we present some arguments on: ( i ) the local concentration of compartmentalized sub-
stances; ( ii ) the entrapment of solutes; ( iii ) the reactivity of solutes inside compartments. 
The reader should understand these discussions not as conclusive, but as a contribution 
to the ongoing research, and maybe feel stimulated to make research efforts in these 
directions. 
 ( i )  Local concentration . When a real vesicle sample is prepared in order to carry out 
internal molecular reactions, it is often useful to know what is the concentration of solutes 
inside the aqueous phase present in the interior of vesicles. The experimentally accessible 
quantity, however, is generally the total amount of solute (e.g., an enzyme) entrapped 
inside the total volume of all vesicles. In fact, with the exception of very large compart-
ments as GVs and w/o or w/o/w compartments, it is generally difﬁ cult to determine the 
individual composition of each vesicle. Electron microscopy may help in some special 
cases, 56,57 and modern ﬂ ow - cytometric techniques have been applied only very recently, 
and for large vesicles.  58   Complex analytical methods have been also used;  59 whereas the 
large size of GVs favours the direct analysis, so that concentration hetereogeneity has 
been promptly observed.  60   The interest toward the determination of individual vesicle 
content is justiﬁ ed by the fact that the theoretical treatment based on the concept of  ‘ water -
 pool ’  – or pseudo - phase  – introduced for reverse micelle systems, cannot be applied in 
the case of vesicles. In fact, whereas in reverse micelles the highly dynamic nature of 
such compartment (that allows solute exchange) average out the individual micelle diver-
sity, liposomes and fatty acid vesicles are characterized by a proper individuality. Far for 
being a disadvantage, such individuality is an important prerequisite for their use as cell

467
models and for their relevance as plausible protocells. Liposomes, in fact, do not fuse in 
absence of speciﬁ c triggers, 61   and do not exchange their content. This fact ultimately 
derives from the well know kinetically - trapped nature of lipid vesicles,  62,63   in contrast to 
reverse micelles, which are classical equilibrium systems. As a main consequence of this 
behaviour, it is expected (and observed) that a population of vesicles is heterogenous in 
terms of internalized solutes. The experimentally observed quantity, however, is often the 
total amount of entrapped solute, for example: 50 pmoles of a certain enzyme have been 
entrapped in 1   mL of 10   mM phosphatidylcholine liposomes (radius 50   nm). The  average 
enzyme concentration inside liposomes can be calculated, estimating the total entrapped 
volume of such liposomes (31    µ L/mL), to give  ca . 1.6  µ M. However, this average con-
centration corresponds to an  average  number of 0.5 enzyme molecules/vesicle. Clearly, 
no half - enzyme molecule will be present in any compartment, and a rough estimate may 
say that 50% of the compartments will contain no enzyme and the other 50% will contain 
just one enzyme. The expected number of enzymes inside vesicles can be predicted by 
means of the Poisson distribution,  30,58,64   which gives, in this case, the probability values 
reported in Figure  17.6 A. We can translate this values in the following physical meaning: 
ca. 60% of liposomes will be empty,  ca . 30% will contain 1 enzyme,  ca . 8% will contain 
2 enzymes and so on. The analysis of the reaction, e.g. in this case the enzyme - catalyzed 
conversion of a substrate into a product, if carried out by averaging techniques ( ‘ batch ’ 
photometry or ﬂ uorimetry, or chemical analysis) cannot reveal this vesicle 
heterogeneity. 
 A second theoretical issue on local concentration is trickier and can be discussed as it 
follows. Chemists normally express molecular concentrations in terms of mole per litre 
(molarity), a 1   M solution being composed by 6.023    ×  10 23 molecules  L  − 1 . Molar concen-
tration can be  calculated  from the number of molecules present is a certain volume. So, 
for instance, we can refer again to the above mentioned case, e.g., a system of 2 enzyme 
molecules in a vesicle volume of 0.5   aL (10  − 18  L); where the  calculated  enzyme concentra-
tion is 6.3  µ M. We may ask, however, if this tiny 6.3    µ M enzyme solution behaves really 
as a  ‘ normal ’  bulk solution of the same concentration, but containing of course a much 
larger number of molecules (10 18    molecules/L). Clearly, when the number of molecules 
is so small, and moreover the system is  ‘ conﬁ ned ’ , classical views on molecular reactivity 
may require a change in our attitude. For example, in the case of enzymatic reactions, 
one issue is the frequency of collision between a single enzyme and its substrate (which 
may also be another macromolecule present itself in few copies), which might result in 
different reaction rates. It is clear that the chemistry of large numbers breaks down when 
small compartments are considered. Stochastic simulations clearly show the relevance of 
ﬂ uctuations when we move from the continuum regime of Avogadro - like numbers to the 
realm of a few molecules  65,66   Discreteness of matter becomes important in compartmental-
ized reactions, and some unexpected behaviours have already been described (see below). 
 ( ii )  Entrapment of solutes . The discussion on Poisson distribution of previous paragraph 
can be used as starting point for the issue of solutes entrapment. More in particular, we 
may ask whether the Poissonian model, which is based on the hypothesis of independent 
events, apply to real mechanism of vesicle formation and entrapment. When a strong 
interaction between solutes and the membrane is present (e.g., electrostatic or hydropho-
bic one), the answer is of course negative, due to the preferential accumulation (or 
deplenishment) of solutes near the bilayers during the liposome formation. However, the

469
question may be relevant also in the absence of strong solute/bilayer interaction. An 
analyical discussion is very difﬁ cult in this case, since  –  for example  –  details of liposome 
formation mechanisms are still missing. Lasic, in his monography,  11 classiﬁ es liposome 
formation mechanisms into two broad classes: (1) budding - off, and (2) collapse/closure 
of small bilayer fragments. Entrapment of water - soluble molecules occurs during these 
processes, and therefore further investigations on such dynamics  – at the molecular level 
 –  would be highly useful for a deeper understanding of entrapment mechanism. From the 
empirical viewpoint, however, there are a number of experimental evidences suggesting 
that more intriguing mechanism may bring to  enhanced  entrapment of solutes, caused by 
possibly cooperative effects. 
 We were ﬁ rst interested in this idea and we have carried out a careful evaluation of 
ferritin entrapment in phosphatidylcholine vesicles.  56,57,67 Ferritin is an iron - rich protein 
that can be easily visualized by electronmicroscopy, so that the composition of each vesi-
cles can be simply obtained by visual inspection of microscopic images. The analysis of 
thousand vesicles leads to the unexpected observation that the numerical distribution of 
ferritin molecules inside vesicles signiﬁ cantly diverges from theoretical one (Poisson 
model). Figure  17.6 B shows a typical result. More recently, Yomo and co - workers  68 
reported that in some condition of liposome formation, genetic material (in form of 
plasmid) may be found inside liposomes in an amount higher than expected; and a 
recent report by Keating  69   suggests that molecular crowding may favour super - entrapment 
inside GVs. 
 A very interesting case, not yet fully clariﬁ ed, concerns the simultaneous entrapment 
of several ( > 80) macromolecular compounds (the whole transcription - translation machin-
ery) inside submicrometric lipid vesicles (radius  ∼ 100  nm). 30   In fact, under the conditions 
of the experiment, the Poisson probability to ﬁ nd a small vesicles containing more 
than 80 different compounds is 10  − 26 , i.e., critically close to zero. However, the experi-
mental results indicate a low but well measurable yield of protein produced by the 
entrapped molecular machinery. Now, the calculated cumulative probability for the 
entrapment of  ca . 80 molecules in a vesicle should be the product of 80 independent 
 Figure 17.6   Entrapment statistics. (A) A Poisson distribution may be used to describe the 
number of solutes entrapped into liposomes. Here it is reported the distribution of a solute 
which is expected to be ﬁ nd on average as 0.5 molecule/vesicle. Notice that there is 
about 10% probability of ﬁ nding  more than two solute molecule inside the vesicle. 
(B) Comparison between calculated and experimental distribution of a water - soluble 
marker (ferritin) inside POPC vesicles. Detailed data analysis shows that in some cases 
ferritin can be entrapped with efﬁ ciency higher than what expected on theoretical basis

The curve (a) indicates the probability of entrapping at least one copy of each molecular 
specie inside the same vesicle. The curve (b) indicates the probability of entrapping at 
least one copy of each molecular species under the hypothesis that their concentrations 
are all 50 times higher than the nominal (bulk) concentrations.  Adapted from Souza  et al 30

Poissonian distribution, and should be size - dependent, as shown in Figure  17.6 C, curve 
a. Large vesicles, in fact, may contain all required ingredients (and be therefore func-
tional), whereas small ones are expected to be not functional. Since the experimental 
results clash with theoretical predictions, a possible physical explanation suggests that 
local (internal) enzymes and ribosomes concentrations are enhanced by a factor  > 10 
(Figure  17.6 C, curve b). Further studies are in progress in order to clarify the nature of 
such effect. 
 ( iii )  Reactivity inside compartments . What are the characteristics of the reactivity 
inside compartments? Can this reactivity be simply the reﬂ ection of the enormous body 
of  in vitro biochemical data? To date, it is not possible to give a clear answer to this 
question, since, as evident from the above - mentioned discussion, we still miss a theoreti-
cal understanding of the compartmentalized systems, and in particular of the effect 
deriving from their small size. In this respect, recently some interesting effects have 
been described, such as the enhanced protein synthesis rate (2 ×  in the ﬁ rst 3 hours) in 
GVs, 70   or the enhanced ﬁ lament assembly based on DNA - protein association rate.  40 In 
the case of protein synthesis in small vesicles (radius  ∼ 100   nm), it has been reported 
that the inner yield is about 6 times the yield of the same reaction in the bulk.  30 These 
deviations from expected results may perhaps derive from molecular crowding and/or 
in vitro conﬁ nement effects, as also suggested by reports on gene expression in moder-
ately crowded model systems (gene brushes),  71   or enhanced protein association in PEG -
 based crowded environments, based on depletion forces.  72   In addition to these effects, 
that may be ascribed to the nature of entrapped solution, it has been also reported that 
lipid itself (surface effects?) may enhance (1.6 × ) the  in vitro  gene expression.  73 Although 
not discussed from the theoretical viewpoint, all these reports indicate a possible exist-
ence of a speciﬁ c effect deriving from conﬁ nement and/or crowding. Interestingly, as 
discussed at the point ( ii ) of this paragraph, enhanced entrapment may also be an outcome 
of liposome formation and entrapment, at least in some cases. A very complex (yet 
fascinating) scenario may emerge from these new studies on compartmentalized system. 
Such intriguing scenario may change our view of reactions in small compartments, and, 
more in general, of cellular biochemistry. We therefore believe that the next generation 
of studies in microcompartmentalized systems must take into account the combined 
effects of single - molecule reactivity, conﬁ nement, molecular crowding, excluded volume, 
and molecular correlation, as well as not - well investigated proteins (or nucleic acids)/
membrane interactions. 
 17.4  A Theoretical Framework for Complex Reactions in Liposomes 
 After the technical excursus presented in the last paragraphs, we now turn back to impor-
tant microcompartmentalized biochemical reactions, in particular those relevant for con-
structing cell models. The reader interested in a more detailed discussion may refer to 
recently published reviews 7,74 
 The research on biochemical reactions inside vesicles has at least three genealogical 
lines. The ﬁ rst is related to origins of life studies, where vesicles (in particular fatty acid 
vesicles) are taken as model of primitive cells. In this studies, vesicles are  per se interest-
ing, since their behaviour may reveal interesting pattern that might be at the basis of the

transition from non - living entities to living ones. Moreover, by creating cellular models 
based on biochemical reactions inside vesicles, it is possible to understand the basic 
principles of compartmentalized systems, and again get insights into the roots of cellular 
life. The second genealogical line, which is also somehow related to the ﬁ rst, is more 
general and deals with the need of realizing (bio)chemical autopoietic systems. Autopoiesis 
(from Greek  ‘ auto ’ : self;  ‘ poiesis ’ : creation, production) describe the nature of life as 
 ‘ self - producing ’  systems, also endowed of basic cognition processes. Autopoietic theory 
was developed by the two Chilean neurobiologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco 
Varela in the Seventies, as a theory that aims to describe life emphasizing the very organi-
zation of its processes, i.e., the organizational invariance despite the continuous building 
and destruction of its structural parts; and the concept of autonomy.  75 – 78 With the realiza-
tion of surfactant - based autopoietic chemical systems, mainly by us in the early 
Nineties, 79 – 81   the concept of creating an autopoietic minimal cell  7,74,82,83   started to attract 
the interest of several research group, although in a diversiﬁ ed way. The third line is more 
modern, and deals with the new and broad research avenue that is called synthetic biology. 
By this constructive approach, scientists tries to understand biological  systems  by building 
them instead of analyzing them. Today, we are witnessing a great interest in synthetic 
biology, perhaps due to its biotechnological promises, but we also think that the new 
constructive view can be useful for basic science and for pure understanding of living 
principles. 
 Let us start the discussion from a theoretical perspective, i.e., the autopoietic system, 
displayed in Figure  17.7 a. Here, a general autopoietic system is represented by a circle, 
the components A being the constituents of autopoietic system. The autopoietic system 
is characterized by an  ‘ inside ’ and an  ‘ outside ’ , and these two worlds are separated by a 
boundary, which is itself generated from the autopoietic system (generation from within). 
Thanks to its inner organization (not shown), the autopoietic system can process X, 
present outside initially, but that can enter the autopoietic unit, so that new A is produced, 
becoming a new part of the autopoietic organization. This ﬁ rst step correspond to genera-
tion of autopoietic component from within. In addition to this route, A can be removed 
from the autopoietic system (A being transformed into W); this second transformation 
correspond to decay of autopoietic components into non - autopoietic ones. It is remarkable 
that notwithstanding with these two opposite routes, the autopoietic unit  –  and, more 
importantly, its organization, is conserved. When the two routes are also balanced, we 
can speak of homeostasis. Clearly, when one of the two routes prevails, growth or decay 
of the autopoietic unit is foreseeable. Moreover, it is clear that the autopoietic system 
interacts with its environment. Undoubtedly, the autopoietic unit describes how living 
cells work. But, thanks to this description, it allows to deﬁ ne what are the minimal func-
tions a living cell must have in order to be recognized as alive (for a recent discussion 
on autopoiesis as necessary and sufﬁ cient  –  or not sufﬁ cient  –  condition for life, see Bitbol 
and Luisi  78  ). It follows that it is a system that  ‘ (1) builds its own boundaries, in a way 
that this construction is due (2) to reaction(s) (activity) taking place within the system, 
and that it is (3) performed through reactions determined by the system itself ’ . 84 Thus, 
such system is autopoietic, and Figure  17.7 a, despite its simplicity, gives a very general 
description of an autopoietic unit. However, in order to translate this description in (bio)
chemical terms, we have to think in molecular terms, and we need a more detailed 
description.

 For example, the X to A transformation of Figure  17.7 a is described without details, 
whereas in chemical terms, several molecular transformations require an additional reac-
tant, and in biology, almost all transformation are catalyzed by enzymes. It follows that 
a slightly more complex description of autopoietic unit is required. In particular, if the X 
to A transformation (Figure  17.7 a) refers to molecular systems, a catalyst C must be 
introduced in the autopoietic organization. Clearly, the catalyst C, being a single mole-
cule,  or a network of processes carried out by several molecules , must also be the product 
of its own activity, as required by autopoiesis. 
 Figure 17.7   Autopoietic systems and complex biochemical reactions in liposomes. 
( a ) The general scheme for an autopoietic system. The autopoietic unit is composed by 
the components A, which constitute the autopoietic unit, boundary included. The external 
component X is incorporated within the autopoietic unit, transformed into an autopoietic 
element A, which takes now part within the autopoietic organization. According to a 
decay process, some autopoietic elements A are transformed into W, which does not take 
part to the autopoietic organization. The autopoietic system has a boundary that 
discriminates between the unit and the environment. However, thanks to the above 
mentioned interactions, the autopoietic unit interacts with the environment. ( b ) A more 
speciﬁ c autopoietic design based on surfactant self - assembled structures. The boundary -
 forming molecular component L is generated by internal transformations starting from a 
precursor X by means of an internal catalyst or catalytic network C. The subsystem C is 
also self - reproducing, by transforming building blocks Y into C, whereas Z ones are 
discarded. A decay reaction also consumes L to give W. This general scheme also 
describes the cell metabolism in an homeostatic state. (c) Some important 
biopolymerization reactions which are implemented in minimal cell models, also based on 
autopoiesis: I. formation of membrane from lipid precursors (a sort of non - covalent 
polymerization); II. formation of RNA from nucleotides (generally indicated as NTPs); III. 
formation of DNA from deoxynucleotides (indicated as dNTPs); IV: formation of proteins 
from amino acids (AAs). These four reactions have been already implemented inside lipid 
vesicles, see also Table  17.1

 In Figure  17.7 b we represent an autopoietic unit composed by boundary - forming mol-
ecules L and by a catalytic system C. The precursor(s) X are now transformed into L 
molecules thanks to the catalytic activity of C, which is also reproducing itself by uptak-
ing the precursor(s) Y. Notice that all component of the systems (L and C) are produced 
from within, the systems is self - bounded, and its behaviour is determined by internal laws. 
Therefore the system in Figure  17.7 b is autopoietic. Also in this case, this system interacts 
with the environment by taking up building blocks (X and Y) and releasing waste products 
(W and Z). 
 Thanks to autopoiesis, we can deﬁ ne minimal functions, implemented them in a syn-
thetic construct, and study the behaviour of such system. Clearly, the system depicted in 
Figure  17.7 b can be realized at different complexity levels, also depending on the chemi-
cal nature of the components. Living cells are autopoietic systems where L are of course 
the lipids (and proteins) constituting the boundary, whereas C is the  whole metabolism 
(including genetic material), that produce itself and the boundary. 
 In recent years, after the achievement of simple chemical autopoietic systems based on 
surfactant self - assemblies 79 – 81   there has been an increasing interest in achieving the ﬁ rst 
minimal cell by implementing biochemical reactions inside vesicles. Such reactions have 
as ﬁ nal goal the synthesis of an autopoietic molecular system as that one represented in 
Figure  17.7 b, although by stepwise advancements. To this aim, several groups started to 
carry out molecular biology reactions inside vesicles, in particular simple enzymatic reac-
tions  –  which will be not discussed here  –  and polymerization reactions (Figure  17.7 c). 
The latter ones have great relevance since (1) all functional biological molecules (proteins, 
RNA, DNA) are biopolymers (the membrane itself can be considered a non - covalent lipid 
polymer); (2) polymerization reactions have also a key role in origins of life studies, since 
they make possible the emergence of ﬁ rst catalysts (such as ribozymes, or the ﬁ rst cata-
lytic peptides) out from small molecules. Notice here that the term polymers is restrictive, 
as enzymes and nucleic acids are actually co - polymers, being formed by several different 
co - monomers. The synthesis of copolymers, and particularly of multiple identical copies 
of ordered sequences, is a very complex problem, and one which is not yet solved in the 
origin of life ﬁ eld - nor experimentally or theoretically. 
 Going back to the question of autopoiesis, Figure  17.7 c also indicates possible  experi-
mental  schemes (indicated as type I to IV systems), and although their implementation 
may be very difﬁ cult, there is no doubt that the interest of the scientiﬁ c community in 
this kind of approaches is continuously growing. We are, however, still far from the 
achievement of a synthetic autopoietic cell, and the current research is addressing the 
basic properties of compartmentalized reactions. In the following, we would like to 
comment in details some relevant cases of the four systems listed in Figure  17.7 c. A full 
list, with short comments, is given in Table  17.1 .

self - reproduction (compare Figure  17.7 a). Oleic anhydride is stratiﬁ ed over a alkaline 
solution containing pre - formed oleate vesicles. Due to basic pH values, the anhydride is 
hydrolyzed giving two oleate molecules. In the absence of pre - formed oleate vesicles, 
this reaction would occur at the (macroscopic) anhydride/buffer interface, proceeding in 
a sluggish way. By contrast, when oleate vesicles are present, the anhydride is rapidly 
hydrolyzed thanks to vesicle catalysis. In particular, anhydride is ﬁ rst solubilised in the 
membrane of oleate vesicles, and then hydrolyzed at the membrane/buffer interface. The 
product of such hydrolysis (oleate molecules) are actually the membrane forming mole-
cules, so that an autopoietic process takes place. Following the surface growth, the vesicle 
become unstable, and in turn it may divide in two or more  daughter  vesicles. These vesi-
cles can start again the cycle and convert more anhydride into new oleate vesicles; notice 
that the process is overall  autocatalytic  and that oleate vesicles follow a sigmoid growth 
proﬁ le.

Reactions in Liposomes

 Recently, by using oleate micelles instead of oleic anhydride, it has been possible to 
apply optical methods to investigate the mechanism of vesicle self - reproduction, leading 
to the discovery of the  ‘ matrix effect ’ , namely the self - reproduction of oleate vesicles in 
a way that the average vesicles size is more or less conserved among vesicle genera-
tions. 24,25,57,86,87   The self - reproduction of vesicles, as shown in Figure  17.8 a, closely resem-
ble the general autopoietic mechanism (Figure  17.7 a), however, the vesicle itself act as 
a sort of catalyst, favoring the transformation of the precursor X (the oleic anhydride) 
into the component of autopoietic unit A (the membrane - forming oleate molecule). In 
more elaborated models, this transformation should be achieved thank to an internal cata-
lysts (compare Figure  17.7 b), which should in turn be reproduced in a true and complete 
autopoietic system. 
 Such complex design has not been realized yet, however there have been two relevant 
attempts ﬁ nalized at this goal. The ﬁ rst, not discussed here, was based on the lipid vesicle 
entrapment of four enzymes, namely the enzymes required to produce phosphatidylcho-
line starting from water - soluble compounds.  88   The aim was to create a lipid - producing 
liposome. The conversion of water - soluble precursors into phosphatidylcholine was 
around 10%, but no morphological changes were observed. A more recent report, based 
on the above mentioned work, is based on protein expression inside liposomes (Figure 
 17.8 b). In this study, the two genes  plsB  and  plsC , codifyng, respectively, for the enzymes 
glycerol - 3 - phosphate acyltransferase (G3PAT, an integral membrane protein), and lyso-
phosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT, a periferal membrane protein), are entrapped 
in a lipid vesicles together with a transcription - translation machinery.  89 The latter  – known 
as PURESYSTEM  90  –  is assembled from puriﬁ ed components, and consists in a set of 
36 enzymes, ribosomes, tRNAs, and all the low molecular - weight components (amino 
acids, GTP, etc.). The composition of lipid membrane (see Table 17.1 entry 23) is opti-
mized in terms of entrapment efﬁ ciency, protein expression yield and  –  more importantly 
 – activity of the two  in situ  synthesized membrane enzymes. This work demonstrates that 
two membrane enzymes can be synthesized in active form inside liposomes. In fact, by 
supplying the substrates  sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphate and palmitoyl - CoA, the ﬁ rst enzyme 
(G3PAT) could produce 1 - palmitoyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphate (a lysophosphatidic acid) 
in 15% yield (% reacted/entrapped). The low yield is due to the low activity of the freshly 
synthesized G3PAT, which is highly hydrophobic, and localizes and folds (in this syn-
thetic system) without assistance of dedicated macromolecules. The second enzyme 
(LPAAT) leads to the ﬁ nal product by adding an oleyl group to the free 2 - hydroxy group 
of lysophosphatidic acid, to give 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphate, i.e. a 
phospholipid that insert in the liposome membrane. Although the yield of the reaction 
catalyzed by LPAAT is rather high ( ∼ 90%, reacted/entrapped), the overal conversion 
(13.5%) is not very high, also because the two enzymes have different optimal redox 
conditions. 
 If we compare the experimental setup (Figure  17.8 b) with the autopoietic model (Figure 
 17.7 b), it is easy to recognize how the different autopoietic functions are implemented 
experimentally. The key transformation (X    →   L) consists in the  stepwise  reaction between 
 sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphate and palmitoyl - CoA, ﬁ rstly, and oleoyl - CoA, later. The product 
readily inserts in the membrane, as required in Figure  17.7 b. The catalysts C required to 
these transformations are two membrane enzymes (G3PAT and LPAAT), which are 
produced by a metabolic systems, starting from the corresponding DNA genes. What is

missing, in the experimental setup, it is the reproduction of the catalysts, of the machinery, 
and of the genes that are involved in the generation of C (namely, the self - reproduction 
of the PURESYSTEM itself and the replication of genes). This has not been achieved 
yet, in any systems (see below for additional discussion on the consequences of this fact). 
Of course, the low yield of lipid production does not favour the observation of autopoietic 
behaviour, ideally the self - reproduction as in the case of anhydride hydrolysis. Moreover, 
with respect with the open system character of autopoietic cells, the substrates X are 
delivered from outside  –  as required by the model, whereas the building blocks Y (amino 
acids, NTPs, etc.) are co - entrapped with the PURESYSTEM. 
 Type II system .  RNA replication inside self - reproducing vesicles . The biosynthesis of 
RNA molecules inside vesicles is also a very important target. It is commonly accepted, 
in fact, that RNA may play a key role in the early phase of life scenario, as epitomized 
in the RNA world hypothesis  91 – 94   an hypothesis that was considerably strengthened by 
the discovery of ribozymes.  95,96   Two early studies (1994) were focused on this topic. 
Poly(adenilic acid) was synthesized inside lipid vesicles by Joyce and Deamer, by exploit-
ing the polynucleotide phosphorilase (PNPase) catalyzed - polymerization of ADP.  97 
Independently, Walde  et al . reported on the same system, but compartmentalized in self -
 reproducing oleate vesicles.  98   In 1995, Oberholzer  et al . 82   reported the replication of RNA 
strands as catalyzed by Q  β  replicase, with the simultaneous oleate vesicle reproduction 
(Figure  17.9 ). This system will be discussed in detail since it represent an interesting case 
of core - and - shell reproduction, although partially successful. 
 Pre - formed oleate vesicles are ﬁ lled with a template RNA, Q  β  replicase and nucleotides 
triphosphate (NTPs). Then, they are put in contact with a second oil phase consisting in 
oleic anhydride. Two reactions occurs simultaneously. Located at the membrane, the 
solubilization of oleic anhydride and its alkaline hydrolysis takes place, leading to vesicle 
growth and division, as discussed in the previous section. In the aqueous vesicle core, 
on the other hand, Q  β  replicase, being a RNA - dependent RNA polymerase, makes addi-
tional copies of the RNA template at the expenses of NTPs, which are also present in 
the vesicle. Therefore, the number of RNA molecules increase due to the replication 
reaction. Following one or more vesicle division cycles, the content of the vesicle is 
redistributed among the  daughter  vesicles, presumably randomly. This is an example of 
simultaneous (although not  coupled ) core - and - shell reproduction. The core reproduction 
is not complete, however, since the catalyst (Q β  replicase) does not reproduce itself, the 
number of such molecules remaining constant. It is therefore foreseeable that at a certain 
point some vesicles  ‘ die ’  due to the dilution of the catalyst, i.e., no catalytic molecule is 
present in the aqueous core so that the vesicle can undergo to shell reproduction only, 
without replicating its inner RNA. When compared with theoretical model (Figure  17.7 b), 
the system depicted in Figure  17.9  shows that shell self - reproduction occurs at the mem-
brane interface, and it is not catalyzed by an internal autopoietic element. On the other 
hand, internalized components are replicated (RNA molecules), but the catalyst is not 
(Q  β  replicase). Moreover, the precursor X (oleic anhydride) is delivered from the envi-
ronment, whereas the building blocks Y (NTPs in this case), are co - entrapped with the 
template and the enzyme inside the vesicles, from the beginning (the system is therefore 
semi - open, as in the previous case). Very recently, Yomo and co - workers  99 reported on 
the Q  β  replicase - catalyzed replication of RNA coding for Q  β  replicase itself  – inside 
liposomes. In this autocatalytic system, RNA is replicated by Q  β  replicase, and Q  β

 Figure 17.9   RNA replication inside self - reproducing oleate vesicles. Q β replicase, an 
RNA - dependent RNA polymerase is entrapped inside oleate vesicles, in the presence of 
RNA template and NTPs. Copies of the RNA template are produced, and, simultaneously, 
oleate vesicles grow and divide according to the mechanism shown in Figure  17.6 . In this 
way, internal RNA is replicated within self - reproducing vesicles. The mechanism stops 
when a daughter vesicles, produced by division of a previously grown vesicle, does not 
contain any Q β replicase molecule. This vesicle  ‘ dies ’ due to the dilution of the catalyst.  82 
Notice that if solutes are always retained in every division step (i.e., without any loss in 
the environment) when only one Q β replicase is present in a certain grown vesicle, the 
division will produce one functional daughter vesicle  
replicase is produced from RNA. The number of two components increases, giving rise 
to a dual numerical and functional replication. Also in this case, however, the system 
does not fully reproduce itself since lipids do not reproduced and  –  more importantly 
 –  the catalysts for the transformation RNA    →  Q  β  replicase (i.e. ribosomes, tRNAs, etc.) 
do not as well. 
 In Table  17.1 , there are additional examples of RNA synthesis inside vesicles, generally 
done by means of a DNA - dependent RNA polymerase. 
 Type III system .  DNA synthesis inside fatty acid vesicles . DNA is today the cellular 
macromolecule where the information about the proteins sequence is stored as ordered 
nucleobases sequence. DNA is thought to appear later than RNA in the molecular evolu-
tion, mainly with the function of storage. Its minor reactivity (due to loss of 2 ′ - OH group) 
favour its chemical stability. The use of DNA polymerization in vesicle - based cell models 
aims to demonstrate how nucleic acids can be synthesized inside compartments, again 
in an origin - of - life perspective. However, due to the recent developments of DNA - based 
biotechnologies, it is possible that DNA - reactions in micro -  or submicro - compartments

may achieve a technological relevance. Our ﬁ rst report (1995) on DNA synthesis in 
liposomes  100   by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated how all common 
processes involved in this very important process are compatible with phospholipid 
vescles (DNA melting, primer annealing, and DNA extension). More recently, Szostak 
and co - workers showed that polymerase - free DNA extension takes place inside fatty acid 
vesicles. 101   In this system, the composition of vesicle membrane was optimized in order 
to display resistance to Mg 2+  ions (needed for DNA oligomerization), as well as maximal 
permeability to reactants, which were added externally. Three different vesicles were 
studied: ( i ) myristoleate  :  glycerol monomyristoleate (2  :  1) vesicles; ( ii ) decanoate:1 -
 decanol  :  glycerol monodecanoate (4  :  1  :  1); and ( iii ) myristoleate  :  farnesol (2  :  1). In all 
cases, the properties of mixed membranes were superior to those of membrane composed 
by pure components. A DNA template was entrapped inside vesicles, together with a 
primer, and the nucleotides (in form of activated nucleotides, i.e., 2 ′ - amino - 2 ′ ,3 ′ -
 dideoxyguanosine - 5 ′  - phosphorimidazolide) were added externally. It has been demon-
strated that activated nucleotides could permeate the vesicle membrane and react inside 
vesicles, giving rise to DNA extension in the absence of catalyst. The product, which 
has high molecular weight (a DNA oligomer 15   bp long) does not escape from the vesi-
cles. When compared with the general autopoietic scheme (Figure  17.7 b), the current 
work shows how building blocks can enter the compartment and fuel the internal oli-
gomerization reaction, driven by thermodynamics thanks to the activation of nucleotides. 
Boundary molecules are not reproduced, however, and no reaction  ‘ rules ’  are provided 
by the internal organization. 
 Type IV system .  Protein synthesis inside lipid vesicles . The ﬁ eld of protein expression 
inside compartments is certainly the most advanced one in context of compartmentalized 
reactions. To date, in fact, it represents the state of the art in the construction of synthetic 
cells (more properly, semi - synthetic cells). This interest is due to the above mentioned 
convergence of some aspects of synthetic biology and experimental studies on the origins 
of life. A comprehensive review of studies on semi - synthetic cells has been recently 
published by us,  7   and other reviews have discussed this subject;  55,102   here we will comment 
on a couple of relevant examples and highlighting some trends and future perspectives. 
The complete list of published works can be found in Table  17.1 . 
 In their 2004 paper, Noireaux and Libchaber describe a very intriguing vesicle - based 
system based on the entrapment of cell extracts within giant vesicles.  49 This work is of 
particular interest because it introduces a conceptual advancement when compared with 
the previous studies. In particular, a plasmid encoding for two proteins is ﬁ rst entrapped 
in giant vesicles, and the two genes are expressed by the transcription/translation machin-
ery, which was also entrapped together with the plasmid (Figure  17.10 a). The two proteins 
were, respectively, the green ﬂ uorescent protein (GFP), which acts as reporter, and  α -
 hemolysin, a water soluble protein that can self - assemble at the membrane into heptamers, 
which constitute a pore (cut - off  ∼ 3   kDa). Hemolysin has the function to create a pore, 
allowing the nutrients (such as additional amino acids, NTPs, and other low molecular 
weight compounds, present in the environment) entering in the liposome, so that addi-
tional GFP (and hemolysin as well) are produced. In this way, it was shown that protein 
synthesis could be extended up to four days (whereas in  ‘ closed ’  vesicles, it generally 
stops after few hours). Even if not stated in the original paper, the formation of the pore 
also allows the escape from vesicle interior of reaction byproducts. This paper is important

because it is the ﬁ rst example of a synthetic cell that interacts with its environment due 
to the presence of an internally synthesized compound. It is easy to imagine that such 
process may be also triggered by an external chemical signal, that may enter in the vesicle 
and stimulate the production of the pore - forming compound, starting in this way a sort 
of communication between the synthetic cell and the environment.  103 Alternatively, an 
internalized byproduct may activate a similar process. If we compare this work with the 
general mechanism (Figure  17.7 b), it is remarkable that the Noireaux and Libchaber 
work 49 fulﬁ ls the conditions of cell/environment communication, and has a complex 
metabolism inside. It does not reproduce the membrane, however, and the internalized 
components are also not reproduced. 
 The second example deals with our contribution to the development of semi - synthetic 
minimal cells, that in the recent years has been very technical, but with important con-
ceptual and physical spin - off, as we will shortly illustrate here. Cell - free protein expres-
sion is a well established procedure, born more than forty years ago  104 and the ﬁ rst studies 
 Figure 17.10   Protein expression inside vesicles and the issue of multiple entrapment. 
(a) An advanced cell model based on protein expression. Two genes, codifying for green 
ﬂ uorescent protein (GFP) and  α - hemolysin, are entrapped inside GVs together with cell 
extracts. The  in situ  produced  α - hemolysin molecules self assemble as heptamer in the 
membrane, forming a pore that allows nutrients to enter the GV, so that a very prolonged 
(4 days) protein expression is observed ﬂ uorimetrically.  49 (b) The expression of GFP inside 
100   nm (radius) vesicles requires the simultaneous presence of more than 80 different 
macromolecular compounds in the same conﬁ ned space. However, the Poisson statistics 
shows that this is a very improbable event, so that the accumulation of solutes inside small 
vesicles has been recently postulated.  30

on protein expression inside liposomes made use of home - made or commercially avail-
able cellular extracts. Very recently, however, Ueda and co - workers developed a new 
protein expression kit consisting of puriﬁ ed components. 90,105   Such kit, now commercially 
available with the trademark PURESYSTEM ®  (Post Genome Institute Co., Ltd., Tokyo), 
i.e. PUriﬁ ed Recombinant Enzymes SYSTEM. As already shortly discussed before, 
PURESYSTEM is composed by 36 individually puriﬁ ed (and His 6 - tagged) enzymes, 
tRNAs mixture, and puriﬁ ed ribosomes. It has been shown that the PURESYSTEM is 
the smallest set of macromolecules required to synthesize proteins  in vitro . It follows, 
then, that the genes codifying for the 36 PURESYSTEM proteins, plus the genes codify-
ing for the 55 macromolecular components of the ribosomes, and those codifying for a 
minimal tRNA set (for a total of about 150 genes), represent a good starting point to 
deﬁ ne operationally the  minimal genome . In a recent study, the group of Moya, based 
on comparative genomics, indicated that the minimal genome should correspond to a 
deﬁ nite set of around 200 genes.  106   It is therefore important to develop minimal cells 
models by using the PURESYSTEM because: (1) from a theoretical point of view, the 
components of PURESYSTEMS and the corresponding genes are  the  parts of a minimal 
semi - synthetic cell, representing, respectively, the minimal number of catalytic macro-
molecules and the minimal genome (notice that a small number of additional functions 
are possibly required); (2) from the  ‘ constructive ’  point of view, it is very valuable car-
rying out experiments with a reconstructed mixture of macromolecules, with known 
concentrations, instead of using  ‘ black boxes ’  as cellular extracts (notice that one of the 
features of synthetic biology is the  ‘ standardization ’  of molecular parts, see for example 
 http://parts.mit.edu ). We therefore started to systematically use PURESYSTEM in com-
partmentalized protein synthesis studies;  107   other research groups are also shifting to this 
molecular tool.  58   The use of PURESYSTEM has another advantage. Since the concentra-
tion of components are known, it is possible to evaluate some physico - chemical param-
eters that were not available in cell extracts. For example, in a recent study, we have 
established a method for protein synthesis inside small (100   nm radius) vesicles,  30 consist-
ing in forming small vesicles in one step, by the already mentioned ethanol injection 
method. By this method, liposomes form spontaneously by lipid self - assembly, and in 
the process of their formation, solutes are entrapped inside liposomes. After entrapment, 
it has been possible to detect the synthesis of green ﬂ uorescent protein within this very 
tiny compartments, albeit in low yield. When this yield was compared with the theoretical 
expected value, it resulted greatly  enhanced , since the calculated yield is about zero. In 
fact, thanks to the knowledge of concentration of PURESYSTEM components, it is pos-
sible to show that the Poisson probability of ﬁ nding a 100   nm (radius) vesicle containing 
all required macromolecular components (and therefore capable to host protein synthesis) 
is about 10  − 26 . But, since protein synthesis did occur in small vesicles, it has been sug-
gested that the entrapment inside lipid vesicles may diverge signiﬁ cantly from the 
expected behaviour, so that inner solute concentration may overcome the external one 
by a factor  > 10 (see Figure  17.10 b). To these super - concentrated vesicles, which may 
represent a very small fraction of the whole population, can be ascribed the observed 
protein synthesis. When compared with EGFP synthesis in bulk water, it also follows 
that the internalized components display an activity which is at least one order of mag-
nitude higher. This result paves the way to new and more detailed investigation on the

physics of vesicle entrapment, so that a new theoretical understanding of this basic phe-
nomenon may appear in the future. 
 Compartmentalized protein synthesis, as noticed above, combines cell - free expression 
with liposome technology. Several important systems have been designed and experi-
mentally done, as shown by the several reports collected in Table  17.1 . There are, 
however, goals not yet achieved, such as the simultaneous protein synthesis (inside the 
vesicle) and vesicle self - reproduction, as done in the case of Q  β replicase experiment. 82 
Moreover, these two processes should occur not only simultaneously, but must be func-
tionally  coupled , i.e. the ﬁ rst process should affect the second, as tentatively done in 
the case of lipid - synthesizing liposomes.  88,89   However, this would not sufﬁ ce. In order 
to make an autopoietic minimal cell, the self - reproduction (or self - replication) of all 
internalized metabolic components is required, so that the issue of  ‘ death by dilution ’ 
is avoided. 
 17.6  Conclusion 
 The importance of compartmentalized reactions is constantly growing and evolving. After 
about 20 years from the ﬁ rst reports on enzymes inside liposomes, current research deals 
also with the assembly of semi - synthetic cells. 
 In this chapter, we have ﬁ rstly discussed the general issue of reactions in liposomes 
from a technical viewpoint. Starting from this basic knowledge, that is general and can 
be applied to whatever chemical system, we have then discussed some relevant examples 
of complex biochemical reactions in liposomes and fatty acid vesicles. This choice reﬂ ects 
the authors ’  interest, more than representing the large spectrum of possible applications,  108 
or the more general ﬁ eld of water - soluble enzymes entrapped inside liposomes (recently 
reviewed by Walde and Ichikawa  31  ). The use of liposomes as a tool to study membrane -
 proteins has also been skipped. 109 
 Despite the advanced of recent years, several open questions are still under debate, and 
future work will maybe clarify some of the important aspects we have discussed in this 
chapter. There are also need of technical advancements, for example to improve the 
reproducibility of vesicle preparation for carrying out compartmentalized reactions. 
 In conclusion, reactions inside vesicles are a challenging and attractive ﬁ eld of inquiry, 
requiring often a multidisciplinary approach, technical skills, efforts and curiosity. The 
most advanced studies on construction of semi - synthetic minimal cells, for example, that 
have also important philosophical aspects, witnessed recently an abrupt rise of interest. 
It appears that one additional reason for this may lie in a sense of conﬁ dence that the 
minimal cell is indeed an experimentally accessible target.
