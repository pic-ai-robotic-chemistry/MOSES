Molecular containers assembled through the
hydrophobic eﬀect
Jacobs H. Jordan and Bruce C. Gibb*
This review focuses on molecular containers formed by assembly processes driven by the hydrophobic
eﬀect, and summarizes the progress made in the field over the last ten years. This small but growing
facet of supramolecular chemistry discusses three classes of molecules used by researchers to
investigate how self-assembly can be applied to form discrete, mono-dispersed, and structurally well-
defined supramolecular entities. The approaches demonstrate the importance of preorganization of
arrays of rigid moieties to define a specific form predisposed to bind, fold, or assemble. As the examples
demonstrate, studying these systems and their properties is teaching us how to control supramolecular
chemistry in water, shedding light on aspects of aqueous solutions chemistry, and illustrating novel
applications that harness the unique properties of the hydrophobic eﬀect.
1.0 Introduction
Why water?
Chemists are spoilt for choice when it comes to solvent;1 in
contemporary chemistry there are literally dozens of diﬀerent
solvents to choose from, each with their own unique properties
to fit a task. So why would a chemist focus on just one? And why
would an organic chemist focus on one that doesn’t dissolve
most organic molecules? Why would an organic chemist choose
water as a solvent? One reason that may be suggested is the
environment. Green chemists might argue that we should aim
for water as the default solvent; that organic chemists should
be systematically converting – by whatever means possible – the
cornucopia of organic reactions in the literature into water-based
processes. Of course, whether or not this is possible, or even
desirable, is debatable. And so for this and many other reasons
organic chemists focus on organic solvents.
But there is no debating that supramolecular chemists should be
very interested in water.2 With important exceptions, the expertise in
controlling and utilizing non-covalent forces that the field has built
up over the last few decades has been grounded in organic solvents.
And yet aqueous chemistry is fundamental to the biosphere, hydro-
sphere, lithosphere and the atmosphere.3 Choose just one of these
(the biosphere?), and one tiny fraction of it (Homo Sapiens?),
and consider all of the key non-covalent interactions going on
in aqueous solution.4 Opportunities abound.
But there are problems. Although pure water is relatively
well understood, there are still some controversies arising from
its dynamic structure. The idea of memory water and poly-water
may have been refuted,5 but the recent debate about the
ability of water to store charge6 should remind us that its
complicatedness – its complexity (in the sense of emergence) –
provides many opportunities to be led astray.
Moving away from the controversial, just the slightest compli-
cation to the pure water picture and our view becomes somewhat
murky.7 Hence, a simple(!) air–water interface, or a change in
pressure or temperature leads to debate and controversy. Dissolve
something in water, be it a salt or a relatively hydrophobic,
organic molecule and the water becomes murkier still. That is
not to say that progress isn’t being made. For example, the
Jones and Ray effect (a minimum in the surface tension of
electrolyte solutions at 1 mM concentrations) – a phenomenon
that caused considerable debate last century – now seems to be
resolved.8 More generally, it now seems clear that certain kinds
of ions do accumulate at the air water interface, and that the
ensuing models can now bridge the divide between physical
chemists who point out that surface tension increases in
solutions as a function of increasing salt concentrations can
only be accounted for by a depletion of ions from the air–water
interface, and atmospheric chemists who can only explain
aerosol properties by having ions accumulate on droplet sur-
faces.9 Progress is also being made in regards to the solvation
of hydrophobic surfaces, although the focus has primarily been
on convex10 and flat surfaces11 and is only more recently
turning to concave surfaces.12 All this noted, there is still plenty
to discover about the hydrophobic effect (most simply put, why
oil and water don’t mix) and the Hofmeister effect (how salts
effect the properties of water and aqueous solutions). Water science
is a rich field barely scratched by supramolecular chemistry.
But one thing is for sure, dissolve benzene and sodium chloride
in water and there are six non-covalent interactions to consider

salt and benzene–salt). Rich pickings for supramolecular chemists.
Topic boundaries of the review
This review focuses on one small but growing area of supra-
molecular chemistry in aqueous solution. As the title suggests,
the topic is molecular containers that are formed by assembly
processes driven by the hydrophobic eﬀect. But when is a
container a container? What is an assembly? And which assem-
blies are, or are not, driven by the hydrophobic eﬀect? We take
the following perspectives.
The definition of a molecular container can be approached
quantitatively or qualitatively, although both are subjective and
arbitrary. Quantitatively, in our minds a molecular container
envelops at least 83% of a smaller guest. This is based on our
experiences at the macroscopic scale. Thus, in the extreme a
container encloses 100% and there is no opportunity for the
inner contents to escape without the opening of the container
itself. Opening the container may be irreversible (an egg), but
most containers can be opened and closed repeatedly because
they have a screw-top or lid, and in our minds a molecular
container is more akin to the plastic boxes devised by Earl
Tupper (Tupperwares) than it is to an open cage-like structure.
Our envisioned containers therefore possess the equivalent of
at least five of six sides and envelop at least 83% (100%  5/6)
of their contents. Qualitatively, we view a molecular container
as fully preventing guest exchange unless the container is opened.
In the case of a true molecular container bond breakage may be
required to do this, but in the context of assembled containers
then disassembly (removing the lid) suﬃces to allow guest
entry or egression.
The extent by which a container envelops is not the only
quality colored by our macro-scale view, so too is our definition
of the type of construction material used to form the molecular
walls. Thus, our definition includes structurally well-defined,
mono-dispersed chemical entities with kinetically stable walls, but
not those that are fluxional and/or poorly defined. We therefore
do not include the topic of fluxional foldamers (but see below),
even though we acknowledge that defining these as fluxional
and/or poorly defined is colored by how they are analyzed.
In chemistry, self-assembly is the process in which a relatively
disordered system of pre-existing molecules or ions forms a
more organized structure as a result of specific, local interac-
tions among the subunits. And so the systems under review here
are principally molecules that form dimers, trimers, tetramers
etc. and in doing so modify (put the lid on) or create the
container. We have however intentionally chosen the more vague
term ‘‘assembly’’ for the title rather than ‘‘self-assembly’’ so that
structurally well-defined self-folding molecules can be included.
In our minds there are too many similarities and overlaps
between self-assembling and self-folding molecules to comple-
tely exclude the latter. Again, we acknowledge the vagaries
in deciding what is and what is not a kinetically or thermo-
dynamically stable entity.
Which assemblies are, or are not, driven by the hydrophobic
eﬀect? That depends on the definition of the hydrophobic
eﬀect. Our view is that it is the phenomenon of the separation
of hydrophobes from water and/or the desolvation of hydro-
phobic surfaces that is primarily driven by the highly cohesive
nature of water. More specifically, it is an observed eﬀect
arising from the strong hydrogen bonding within water and,
to a lesser extent, the van der Waals forces between solutes.
The simple face-to-face cyclohexane dimer in water illustrates
this idea perfectly. But it doesn’t take much structural diversity
to make things ambiguous. Is a similar face-to-face dimer of
cyclohexanol driven by the hydrophobic eﬀect? Or is the
potential hydrogen bond between alcohol OH groups impor-
tant? Our drawing of the line in this regard is based on the
following: (1) the system in question must be in water. Systems
with co-solvents were not included (mostly); (2) no systems
involving covalent, or strong non-covalent interactions such as
metal coordination, are discussed in detail. Reversible13 and
irreversible covalent bond14 formation and metal–ligand driven
assembly15 are very important topic in self-assembly but are
excluded here; (3) there must be both structural features in the
solute and empirical evidence that desolvation of hydrophobic
surfaces is key to assembly.
Finally, in this paper we have tried to summarize the progress
made in the field over the last ten years. During this time-period
we have attempted to be as comprehensive as possible. However,
as is always the case, the topic of ‘‘molecular containers assembled
through the hydrophobic eﬀect’’ did not appear out of the
ether. Consequently, where appropriate we have stretched back
in the literature to before 2004.
2.0 Classes of self-assembling
molecules
2.1
Deep-cavity cavitands
2.1.1
Investigating the properties of deep-cavity cavitands
(a) Synthesis, structure and coatings. The water-soluble deep-
cavity cavitands discussed here have their roots in analogous
organic-soluble deep-cavity cavitands devised by the Gibb group.16
Available in two linear steps from the respective resorcinarene,
hosts such as 1 possess deeper pockets than those popularized by
Cram and others, and acted as a proof-of-concept for the facile
formation of relatively rigid (non-collapsing) binding pockets.
Building on this early work, the Gibb group reported the first
example of a water-soluble deep-cavity cavitand (2) that binds
and assembles into well-defined supramolecular entities via
the hydrophobic eﬀect; a host that is commonly called octa-acid
(OA).17 The synthesis of OA 218 involves six steps from the
requisite resorcinarene, only one of which requires chromato-
graphic separation. Consequently, gram quantities of OA 2 are
readily available. Briefly (Scheme 1), the resorcinarene scaﬀold
was built up by first stereoselective bridging resorcinarene 3 with the
corresponding benzal bromide (1-3-dibromo-5-(dibromomethyl)-
benzene) to aﬀord the deep-cavity cavitand octabromide 4.16e,19
Subsequently, an eight-fold Ullmann ether reaction introduces
rigidity to the cavity and adds functionality at the rim in the
form of hydroxyl groups (5). Oxidation then gives crude OA 2.

Esterification followed by chromatographic purification, then
hydrolysis of the octa-ester 6 aﬀords OA 2 in six linear steps.
Taking OA 2 as a representative of this class of molecule,
these hosts possess a ca. 0.8 nm diameter wide and ca. 0.8 nm
deep hydrophobic pocket comprised primarily of eight aromatic
rings (Fig. 1). Atop the cavity, forming a rim around the portal,
are four more aromatic rings orthogonal to the C4 axis of the
host that ‘stitch’ the bowl together. The rim defined by these four
rings is relatively hydrophobic and is key to the predisposition20
of the molecules to assemble into supramolecular capsules.
In addition, they provide diverging functionalization points for
water solubilizing groups (R1, in this case four carboxylic acids),
as well as four converging (endo) positions for groups that modulate
the shape and properties of the hydrophobic pocket (R2). Four
more functional groups for water-solubilization can be found
at the termini of the pendant groups that hang down from the
main bowl structure (R3).
By virtue of its eight carboxylic acid/carboxylate groups OA 2
is soluble in tens of micromolar concentration at pH 7, and
greater than one hundred millimolar concentrations at pH 9 or
above. As is outlined in this section, this deep-cavity cavitand
has been the most utilized and studied of this family of hosts.

Key to this point is not only its good water solubility, but also its good
behavior under a variety of conditions. Thus, whereas at above pH E
10 and concentrations less than 10 mM random aggregation of the
host is rare, the presence of guests from as small as propane21 to as
large as cholesterol17 trigger quantitative dimerization into mono-
dispersed capsular complexes. We attribute the good behavior of
OA 2 not only to the fact that it has eight water-solubilizing groups,
but also to the fact that they are distributed in an pseudo square anti-
prismatic or anti-cubic array that spreads the negative charges
evenly (but not uniformly) around its outer surface (eight, maximally
distant points on the surface of a sphere define an anti-cube). The
distortion to the anti-cube – that the upper portal face is larger than
its opposing face, and the carboxylates on the rim are below the lip of
the pocket – means that the charge distribution is not even; the
upper portal face is a relatively hydrophobic surface and likely
contributes to the predisposition of these hosts to assemble.
Before discussing the diﬀerent derivatives of these water-
soluble deep-cavity cavitands it is worth noting the fine balance
between charge number/charge distribution and the water
solubility of these hosts; a concept that applies to the design
of water-soluble hosts and self-assembling subunits in general.
Cavitands 7, possessing only four carboxylic acid groups,
aggregates in aqueous solution and DMSO is required as a
co-solvent to give interpretable NMR spectra.22 It is a similar
story for host 8 (R = 3,5-benzene dicarboxylic acid), whose eight
water-solubilizing groups are all on one end of the molecule.
This host is too amphiphilic and also undergoes aggregation in
aqueous solution.
As well as these anionic hosts, neutral and cationic deriva-
tives have also been synthesized. Examples of these are high-
lighted in the following sections. Here we briefly highlight
some examples from these two classes for illustrative purposes.
The first example of a neutral water-soluble host was third
generation (G3) dendrimer 9 (Scheme 2) from the Grayson
group.23 The G3 host 9 was prepared by three successive rounds
of coupling, and deprotection starting from the precursor
compound octol 5. Thus, the eight hydroxy moieties were
dendronized with an acetonide-protected anhydride and depro-
tected using a solid-phase acid resin to give the G1 cavitand
with 16 hydroxyl groups. Two successive rounds of protection-
coupling-deprotection gave the G3 cavitand with 64 water-
solubilizing hydroxyls on the termini of the dendritic chains.
Three generations of dendrimer were necessary for full water
solubility. Thus the corresponding G2 cavitand required at least
20% methanol solutions for dissolution. Although possessing
the same type of properties of OA 2 (see below), guest aﬃnities
to the G3 cavitand 9 were generally lower than with OA 2. This
was attributed to self-inclusion of the dendritic arms within the
hydrophobic concavity.
In an alternative approach, Grayson introduced a range of
surface modifications using Cu(I) catalyzed aza-alkyne cyclo-
addition (‘‘click’’) chemistry. Thus, the octol 5 was treated with
a carbodiimide in the presence of 4-pentynoic acid to give the
activated core cavitand 10 with eight alkynes protruding from
the exterior (Scheme 3). Subsequently, treatment of 10 with an
excess of the requisite azide under ‘‘click’’ conditions led to an
array of coated hosts (11) including two with dendrons, and
several with polymer coats such as polycaprolactone (PCL), and
polyethylene glycol (PEG). All of the functionalized cavitands
were highly mono-disperse and were characterized by MALDI-
TOF MS analysis. The PCL-grafted cavitand showed increased
solubility in organic solvents, whilst the PEGylated cavitand

showed increased solubility in polar solvents such as methanol
(488 mg ml1), ethanol (424 mg ml1) and water (433 mg ml1).
The first example of water-soluble cavitands coated with
cationic groups, host 12 and its octa-triethyl ammonium deri-
vative, have been recently reported by the Ramamurthy group.24
The initial studies on these hosts suggest that at low pH, 12
undergoes a degree of aggregation, but that it is better behaved
as a complex with diﬀerent guests. Preliminary host–guest and
photochemical studies suggest properties similar to OA 2.
On the other hand, preliminary work with the corresponding
octa-triethyl ammonium derivative suggest a poorly behaved
host at neutral pH. Interestingly, host 12 also allowed the first
glimpse in the gas phase of the 1 : 1 and capsular complexes
made by these types of hosts.25
(b) Factors aﬀecting complexation and assembly. Both the
nature of the host and guest are important in the complexes
formed by deep-cavity cavitands. To date the following host–
guest complexes have been identified with deep-cavity cavitands:
1 : 1, 1 : 2, 2 : 1, 2 : 2, 4 : 2 and 6 : 3. We will focus first on guest
effects and the formation of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 complexes to high-
light why one or the other forms.
Guest eﬀects. The Gibb group first identified the key point
about forming 1 : 1 complexes with OA 2 in a study of the
binding of a range of cyclic and acyclic aliphatic carboxylates.26
1H NMR showed that these amphiphilic guests bound with
their hydrophobic chains in the pocket of host 2, and their
polar carboxylates exposed to the free aqueous medium.
Consequently, by binding in the orientation specific manner
the ‘upper’ surface of the host defined by the portal to the
pocket and its attendant rim is rendered more hydrophilic and
assembly to the capsular state is switched oﬀ. A later study with
related molecules confirmed these findings.27
In the study of cyclic and acyclic aliphatic carboxylates,26
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) were utilized to examine
three cyclic and three acyclic carboxylates typified by hexanoate
13 and adamantane carboxylate 14 (Fig. 2). All of the examined
carboxylates were found to associate with a Ka of between 103
and 106 M1, with the weakest being hexanoate (Ka = 3.64  103)
and the strongest proving to be adamantane carboxylate
(Ka = 1.14  106). Butanoate, with a short propyl chain, did
not bind. Apparently, the propyl chain was unable to eﬀectively
compete with the hydrophilicity of the carboxylate. A linear trend
was observed for the relationship between DG1 for complexation
and the number of carbon atoms in the guest (Nc). DG1 values
become more favorable with increasing number of Nc, with the
gradients dDG1/dNc for the acyclic acids and cyclic acids
respectively being similar to those observed for the transfer of
hydrocarbons from water to organic solvents.
Examining how the enthalpy and entropy changes as a
function of Nc revealed two trends. First, for the acyclic guests
as Nc increased both the entropy and enthalpy terms for
complexation became more favorable. In contrast, enthalpy–
entropy compensation was observed with the cyclic guests;
with increasing Nc the entropy component of binding became
less favorable, while the enthalpy component became more
favorable. This was interpreted to arise from increasing host–
guest contacts with larger guests being countered by restricted
motion within the cavity.
For both series, the thermodynamics of complexation as
a function of temperature displayed near perfect enthalpy–
entropy compensation so that DG1 was nearly independent
of T. In all cases the exothermicity of complexation increase

upon
complexation was negative. The obtained values were generally
equal to and/or greater than those seen with cyclodextrins,
perhaps reflective of the more hydrophobic pocket of the deep-
cavity cavitand. Expanding on this work, the same authors
recently examined the binding of a series of cyclic aliphatic and
aromatic carboxylates as part of the fourth statistical assessment
of modeling of proteins and ligands (sampl.eyesopen.com).28
Another illustrative example of the formation of 1 : 1
complexes is the binding of ‘hydrophobic’ anions to the cavity
of OA 2.29 This work examined the eﬀects of diﬀerent salts on
the binding of adamantane carboxylate 14. There was only a slight
change in the free energy of guest binding (B0.5 kcal mol1)
between the absence and presence of salting-out salts such as
sodium fluoride. In these cases complexation was strongly
endothermic and only slightly entropically promoted. In contrast
to this were the series of salting-in sodium salts (chlorate, iodide,
thiocyanate and perchlorate) which demonstrated a trend towards
a decreasing free energy of complexation. Underlying this free
energy change was a dramatic decline in the contribution to the
free energy by enthalpy and a concomitant increase in the
contribution made by entropy; so much so that in the presence
of sodium perchlorate, guest binding was entirely entropy driven
and the binding of 14 was actually endothermic.
1H NMR showed that fundamental to the reported changes
in thermodynamics with salting-in salts was anion binding to
the pocket of the host competing with the complexation of 14.
Subsequent NMR titrations of salt to OA 2 without 14 revealed
association constants ranging from o1 M1 in the case of sodium
nitrate, to 95 M1 in the case of sodium perchlorate. This first
reported instance of inorganic anion binding to a hydrophobic
pocket again demonstrates that like 13 or 14, very small charged
guests lead to 1 :1 complexes.
It is understood that anionic amphiphiles and simple
anions form 1 : 1 complexes with OA 2 because the upper portal
region of the complex remains quite hydrophilic. If on the other
hand the binding of a guest renders the portal region of OA 2
hydrophobic, then there is a thermodynamic preference for a
second host molecule to cap the complex and form an encap-
sulation complex. In fact, the first complexes reported with
OA 2 were 2 : 1 host–guest complexes with steroids.17 In this
report a number of steroid guests were encapsulated including
estradiol 15, progesterone 16 and cholesterol 17 (Fig. 3). In each
case, because of the chirality of the guest the 2 : 1 host–guest
complexes could be identified from symmetry arguments of
the 1H NMR data alone. In addition though, 2D NOESY NMR
confirmed the spatial proximity of the host–host interactions
and the host–guest interactions from the two sets of non-
equivalent hydrogens in each hemisphere of the capsule.
Guests such as 15 and 16 formed very stable and structurally
defined complexes, with a Ka for the former (empty capsule to
full capsule) estimated to be 41  108 M1. Strong as these
complexes are however, they were ‘denatured’ when methanol
was added to the solution. It is noteworthy that the steroids such
as cholesterol 17, although greatly solubilized by the host, did
not form kinetically stable complexes (on the NMR time scale).
In such cases, the length of guest is too large for the capsule and
as a result the two hemispheres of the capsule cannot clamp
down on one another and must remain partially solvated.
The stability of 2 : 1 host–guest capsular complexes involving
OA 2 to co-solvent induced denaturation has been examined
using 1H NMR.30 In this study, a series of capsular complexes
of trioxolane guests, e.g. 18–20 (Fig. 4) were investigated. The
trioxolanes varied from practically insoluble to sparingly
soluble in aqueous media, yet nevertheless were fully dissolved
in a 2 : 1 solution of OA 2 in aqueous buffer. 1H NMR demon-
strated that all of these trioxolanes were readily taken up as a
kinetically and thermodynamically stable 2 : 1 complex. The
denaturation experiments of the different complexes utilized
a series of per-deuterated water miscible solvents, namely:
acetone-d6,
dimethylsulfoxide-d6
(DMSO-d6)
methanol-d4,
ethanol-d6, isopropanol-d8, acetonitrile-d3, and tetrahydro-
furan-d8 (THF-d8); as well as trifluoroethanol (TFE). Overall,
18 formed the weakest of the complexes, and a 1 : 1 ratio of
the host and guest did not form any 1 : 1 or 2 : 1 complex in
50% aqueous acetone. On the other hand, under identical
conditions guest 19 formed 78% 1 : 1 and no 2 : 1 complex.
Because of solubility issues with 20, only a 2 : 1 host–guest ratio
could be examined in 50% aqueous acetone, in which case the
mixture formed essentially only the 2 : 1 complex.
The diﬀerent cyclic alkyl groups of 19 proved illuminating in
so much as it was possible to observe the denaturation of the
2 : 1 capsular complex to form the 1 : 1 complex in which the
adamantyl group is bound, and ultimately the breakdown of
this complex with even higher equivalents of added co-solvent.
Overall, for the diﬀerent solvents examined, the ability to denature
the complex formed by 19 was: acetonitrile-d3 4 THF-d8 4 TFE 4
i-PrOD-d8 4 acetone-d6 4 ethanol-d6 4 methanol-d4 E DMSO-d6.
Thus it was observed that whereas acetonitrile denatures most
of the capsular complex at 30% by volume, a 70% aqueous
solution of DMSO was needed to bring about the same extent
of decomplexation.
In related work it has been shown that a fully fitting and
rigid guest is not a prerequisite for capsule formation, but
that even small straight-chain alkanes can lead to assembly.31
In this work, the authors investigated the binding of the alkanes

n-pentane through n-octadecane (C18). Although, the latter
guest was reportedly (vide infra) too large to form a kinetically
stable complex, the C5–C17 guests did form stable complexes
with assembly/disassembly rates slower than the NMR timescale.
As was noted for the aforementioned steroid and trioxolane com-
plexes, for the free host the diffusion constant (D) as determined by
pulse-gradient stimulated spin-echo (PGSE) NMR experiment was
1.82  106 cm2 s1, considerably larger than that for the capsular
complexes (D = 1.36  106 cm2 s1).
More specifically, the guests n-pentane through n-heptane
were found to form stable 2 : 2 complexes with OA 2. These were
the first examples of multiple molecules binding within the
capsule formed by the host. Apparently there is too much empty
space in the capsule when only one molecule is encapsulated.
For the longer alkanes examined, the complexes formed were
2 : 1 in stoichiometry; the one exception being intermediately
sized n-octane which formed both 2 : 1 and 2 : 2 capsules in
a temperature dependent ratio (the quaternary complex dom-
inating at higher temperature).
The propensity for deep-cavity cavitands to tend towards
capsule formation was further investigated by comparing a series
of guests of roughly equal volume but diﬀering polarity/water
solubility (Fig. 5).32 In these instances, it was shown that as the
number of oxygen atoms increased in the series the stability of
the corresponding capsular complexes decreased.
Competition experiments between the varying guests indicated
that both tridecane (C13) 21 and dodecanol 22 bound strongly and
favored 2:1 capsule formation, with the former possessing a
binding aﬃnity an order of magnitude greater than the latter.
This was attributed to both the hydrophilicity of the polar hydroxyl
group of 22 and its ability to hydrogen bond and be freely solvated
by waters, and the loss of C–Hp interactions between the host
and guest upon replacement of the terminal methyl of 21. Both
tridecane 21 and dodecanol 22 adopt an extended, pole-to-pole
motif within the capsule (for guest packing within the capsule
formed by OA 2 see Section 2.1.1.e), and for the methylene groups
at C-1 and C-11 of 22 the Dd values indicated that the hydroxyl
moiety was bound more deeply in one half of the capsule that the
methyl group was in the other.
While the other guests 23 and 24 had clearly defined NMR
signals indicative of 2 : 1 complexation, 2-[2-(2-propoxyethoxy)-
ethoxy] ethanol (tri(ethylene glycol)propyl ether) 25 exhibited
broadened signals which were confirmed by PGSE NMR to be
due to a capsule of low stability. Furthermore, bis[2-(2-hydroxy-
ethoxy)ethyl] ether tetra(ethylene glycol) 26 did not show any
signals indicative of capsule formation and indeed was confirmed
by PGSE NMR to form only a 1 : 1 complex. An interesting side-
note regarding 26 is that opinion is split about whether it is
hydrophilic or hydrophobic. At least by the metric of binding to
OA 2 the answer is clear; it is relatively hydrophobic.
To recap, the question of whether a 1 : 1 or a capsular
complex is formed with cavitands such as OA 2 rests in large
part on the nature of the guest. If the guest is highly water
soluble, or at least can adopt a binding orientation that projects
a polar group to the portal of the host, then only a 1 : 1 complex
will be formed. If on the other hand the guest binds and the net
polarity of the portal/rim region of the host–guest complex is
hydrophobic, then a capsular complex is preferentially formed;
and the more hydrophobic the guest the stronger the capsular
complex that is formed.
Host eﬀects. In addition to the nature of the guest, the
structure of the host also plays a role in the assemblies seen. This
was first demonstrated with the deep-cavity cavitand TEMOA
(tetra-endo-methyl octa-acid, 27). In an analogous procedure to
that utilized in the synthesis of OA 2, TEMOA 27 was synthesized
by the eight-fold Ullmann reaction of octabromide 4 (Scheme 1)
with 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methylbenzyl alcohol. This aﬀorded four
methyl substituents in place of the corresponding protons at
the hydrophobic rim, which after oxidation, esterification and
purification, and hydrolysis led to host 27.33
The four endo methyl groups of 27 provide for a slightly
deeper cavity with a narrower portal region. Furthermore, the
methyls crenellate the rim of the cavity and consequently
disrupt 2 : 1 capsule formation. As a result, its properties are
quite diﬀerent from OA 2. For example, as a function of guest
size the assembly of OA 2 is straightforward: with small guests
such as methane and ethane it forms 1 : 1 complexes (vide
infra), but with bigger guests a 2 : 2 and then a 2 : 1 capsule is
formed (vide supra). In contrast, diﬀusion NMR experiments
revealed that TEMOA 27 forms 1 : 1 assemblies for methane,
ethane, n-heptane and n-octane, a mixture of 1 : 1 and 2 : 2
complexes with propane, n-butane, and n-hexane, and only
capsular assemblies for n-pentane (2 : 2) and the longer chain
alkanes C9 to C14 (2 : 1).31,33 Why? It would appear that because
the methyl groups at the rim of 27 reduce its predisposition to
dimerize, 1 : 1 complexes are preferentially formed even with
some hydrophobic guests. This occurs with methane and ethane
because they are too small and the 2 : 2 complexes would have
too much void space, and with n-heptane (C7) and n-octane (C8)
because in both cases two guests cannot fit in the capsule and

the 2 : 1 complexes again would have too much empty space. In
contrast, n-pentane can form a relatively stable 2 : 2 complex,
and the longer chain alkanes C9 to C14 form relatively stable 2 : 1
capsular complexes. The guests propane, n-butane, and n-hexane
are intermediate between the ‘islands of stability’ defined by
n-pentane, and the alkanes C9 to C14.
The unusual assembly properties of TEMOA 27 are reflected
in what happens with mixtures of it and OA 2.34 In this work
NMR was used to probe the extent of hetero-capsule formation
when these two hosts are combined, i.e., whether a guest or guests
were complexed inside 22, 272, or 227. A range of n-alkanes
(C5 to C16) was used in this study.
A combination of
1H and NOESY NMR confirmed the
possibility of hetero-capsule formation, and that the ratio of
the homo- and hetero-capsular complexes varied depending on
the nature of the included guest. Thus 24% of the hetero-complex
involving 2 and 27 was formed in the presence of n-heptane
(C7), whereas 74% was formed in the presence of n-tridecane
(C13). Overall, the extent of hetero-capsule formation was high
for guests n-pentane, n-hexane and C9–C14, and small for C7, C8,
C15, and C16 (Fig. 6). It was noted that there was a reasonable
correlation between the extent of this hetero-capsule formation
and the measured hydrodynamic volumes of the homo-capsular
complexes formed by TEMOA 27 alone in the presence of the
same guests (Fig. 6). These results were interpreted as follows.
First, the guests n-heptane (C7) and n-octane (C8) formed limited
amounts of hetero-capsular complex because they are poor
templates of both homo- and hetero-capsules. As a result, it is
energetically preferential for TEMOA 27 to form 1 : 1 complexes
and allow OA 2 to from stable homo-capsular complexes. In
other words, these guests promote self-sorting of OA 2. For the
guests C9 through C14, the higher amounts of hetero-capsular
complex formed was attributed to the more efficient packing of
the (singular) guest within the capsular complexes compensating
for the limited ability of 27 to assemble. The reason why the
largest guests examined (C15 and C16) formed below statistical
amounts of hetero-complex was not discussed.
The point that the methyl groups of deep-cavity cavitand
TEMOA 27 reduce its predisposition to form a dimer capsule
suggests that other assembly pathways may be more favorable
to this host. Relatively recently this has indeed been shown to
be the case.35 Thus, whereas OA 2 has only been observed to
assemble into dimers, TEMOA 27 can form dimeric, tetrameric
and even hexameric capsules depending on the size of the guest
that is encapsulated (Fig. 7a).
The diﬀerent assembly states of TEMOA 27 were identified
by investigating a series of homologous n-alkanes, from n-tetra-
decane (C14) to n-hexacosane (C26). While the C14 guest bound
in the typical 2 : 1 fashion previously observed with OA 2,
(1H and PGSE NMR), longer alkane chains (C17–C20) formed

pseudo Td (D2d) 4:2 host–guest complexes. Models suggest that
the inner volume of this tetrameric host shell to be 1400–1500 Å3,
i.e., this assembly is more voluminous than the familiar resor-
cinarene hexamer.36 In contrast, the intermediate length
guests, the C15 and C16 alkanes, showed broad and/or poorly
resolved NMR spectra suggesting that mixtures of assembly
products were formed. Furthermore, although this was also the
case with the C21 to C23 guests, with n-tetracosane (C24) only one
highly symmetric assembly product was observed in a 2 : 1 host–
guest ratio. PGSE diffusion NMR examination of the host–guest
signals indicated a diffusion coefficient of 9.6  107 cm2 s1,
which after correction for the higher working concentrations
revealed a hydrodynamic volume of 48.9 nm3. In short, C24
formed a nonary 6 : 3 host–guest complex with overall Oh
symmetry and an estimated internal volume of between 3200
and 3700 Å3. The same complex was also observed for the
longer guests n-pentacosane (C25) and n-hexacosane (C26), but
unfortunately the kinetics of complex formation with even
longer alkanes were too slow to investigate the formation of
still larger assemblies. The precise packing arrangement of the
two or three guests in the pseudo Td and Oh capsules could not
be surmised from the given data, but from the highfield
positioning of the shielded guest methyl signal and the large
anisotropy of the guest signals it was assumed that, to take the
pseudo Td capsule as an example, the guests adopt one of three
different arrangements in which each end of a guest occupies one
cavity of a host: an X-motif, a double U-motif, or a ‘catenated’
double U-motif (Fig. 7b).
(c) Environment inside the OA capsule. We have noted that OA
2 and TEMOA 27 are predisposed to form respectively dimeric,
and dimeric, tetrameric and hexameric assemblies depending
on the guests. In addition, the aforementioned studies reveal
that it is the hydrophobic eﬀect that drives the formation of
these supramolecular entities. If this is indeed the case, then
desolvation of the pocket and rim of the host, and of course
desolvation of the guest molecules, must both be key. This
leads to the question, are there any water molecules within the
cavity of these capsular complexes? It is noteworthy that mole-
cular dynamics simulations have indicated that water molecules
are included within the hydrophobic concavity of free OA 2.37
These calculations suggest that on average there are 4.34  0.04
water molecules inside the hydrophobic pocket of the free host.
Nature simply abhors a vacuum. Furthermore, these simulations
reveal that during a wetting event the number of water molecules
fluctuate, with four being the most probable (or lowest free
energy) and the maximum number being seven. Overall, DGhyd
of the cavity was estimated to be 5 kcal mol1, with DHhyd E
20 kcal mol1 and TDShyd E 15 kcal mol1. This study also
determined that these hydrophobic pocket waters are stabilized
by their interaction with the bulk. Thus, when a hydrophobe
approaches the portal of the pocket the cavity is rapidly and
completely dewetted. Is there complete dewetting when a
capsule is formed? The use of fluorescent probes as guests has
addressed this question. For example, the ratio of the I1 and I3
vibronic bands in the fluorescence spectrum of pyrene 28 (Fig. 8)
confirm that no waters are present in the complex of 28 with
OA 2.38 Furthermore, a more comprehensive study suggests that –
at least for sizeable guests that fill most of the cavity – this is the
case regardless of the nature of the guest encapsulated.39 To take
one example from a series of guests investigated, coumarin-1 29,
whose fluorescent quantum yield and lifetime increase with a
decrease in solvent polarity, also demonstrated a low polarity
environment inside the capsule. Overall these results suggest that,
as would be expected considering the nature of the host, the
environment inside the OA 2 dimer is benzene-like. To the authors’
knowledge, a study of the environment within the TEMOA tetramer
or hexamer has not been undertaken.
(d) Kinetics of capsule opening and closing. The very earliest
studies with these container molecules demonstrated that for
most hydrophobic guests the exchange between the free and the
encapsulated state is slow on the NMR timescale; the lifetimes
of many complexes are 40.1 s. This point noted, there remains
the idea that very small (atomic or diatomic) guests such as
molecular oxygen might be able to enter an occupied capsule
via partial opening (breathing) of the equatorial seam of the
container. The first detailed analysis focusing on this possibility
came from measurements of the rate constants for the quenching
of excited singlet and triplet guests by oxygen.40 These guests
included (Fig. 9) T1 excited dimethyl benzil 30 (phosphorescence)
and S1 excited phenanthrene 31 (fluorescence), and covered
excited-state lifetimes from 0.05 to 922 ms. Two classes of guests
were observed, those that were quenched by oxygen when
enclosed within the capsule, and those that were not. The latter
were a mixture of singlet and triplet guests and therefore the
spin state of the guest was dismissed as an explanation for why
these guests were not quenched. Rather the obtained results
reflected the guest-dependent accessibility of oxygen to the
bound guest; if the guest had an excited lifetime of less than
5 ms it was inaccessible to oxygen.

encapsulation complexes formed by OA 2, the Bohne group

measured the real-time kinetics of formation of the 1 : 1 and
2 : 1 host–guest complexes formed between OA 2 and pyrene 28
(Fig. 10).41 Pyrene 28 formed the expected 2 : 1 host–guest
complex in aqueous solution, and upon encapsulation there
was a marked red shift (5–6 nm) in its excitation and absorption
spectra. This could not be attributed to dimerization of the guest
as no excimer emission or spectral broadening was observed.
Further evidence for the encapsulation of a single molecule of 28
within the OA 2 dimer was that its fluorescence lifetime was
nearly three times longer than free 28 in aqueous borate buffer
(361  1 ns vs. 130  1 ns), whilst the quenching rate by iodide
anion was roughly four orders of magnitude slower (5.9  0.7 
105 M1 s1 vs. 1.0  0.2  109 M1 s1). As the iodide
quenching rate constant was similar to that observed for oxygen
quenching of the triplet excited 28 within the OA 2 dimer,38 this
suggested a similar mode of action, namely, a partial opening
of the capsular complex allowing small guest entry and egress.
Measurements of the fluorescent intensity change of the
complex as a function of added OA 2 were carried out and the
observed trend fitted the expected 2 : 1 binding isotherm with
an overall b21 of 3.2  1012 M2. Subsequent stopped-flow
experiments successfully probed eqn (1) (Fig. 10), and identified
a fast reaction for the formation of the 1 : 1 complex with a
K11 value of K1 = (4.5  0.6)  105 M1. Hence a K21 value of
K21 = (7  1)  106 M1 could be calculated (eqn (4)). The K11
and K21 values represented the first thermodynamic view of the
diﬀerence between forming a 1 : 1 complex (desolvating half the
guest and the pocket) and capping this complex (desolvating
half the guest a pocket, and the two rims of the subunits).
This clamping down of the two hemispheres in the second step
leads to an association constant K21 one order of magnitude
larger than the formation of the 1 : 1 complex, and is why K11
of the transient 1 : 1 complex could only be determined from
kinetic experiments.
The lifetime of the capsular complex encapsulating 28 was
also determined in this study. Thus the K21
+ and K21
 values
((2.6  0.2)  106 M1 s1 and 0.37  0.06 s1 respectively) were
obtained from global fitting of the slow change in fluorescence
intensity attributed to the second step of the assembly (eqn (2)),
and how this was modulated as a function of OA 2. This
gave a lifetime for the 2228 complex of 2.7 s. While the afore-
mentioned entrance/egress of small molecules occurred on
the microsecond timescale, these results suggest that for the
complex with 28 the ‘breathing’ of the complex was on the
order of 105 times faster than the release of 28.
(e) Movement of internalized guests and guest packing motifs.
The shape of guests such as steroids forces them to bind along
the long Y-axis of the capsule (Fig. 11).17 Whilst their rigidity
precludes their rotation around the X or Z axes of the capsule,
even such rigid guests are capable of rotation around their
Y-axis. The net eﬀect of this movement is that by NMR the
two hemispheres of the capsule are non-equivalent but each
maintains its C4 symmetry. In contrast, although flexible and
highly mobile guests such as ethylene glycol monononyl ether
23 have been shown to bind in a similar pole-to-pole manner
(Fig. 11), the two hemispheres of the capsule appear equivalent
because on the NMR timescale the guest can freely tumble
around the X or Z-axis of the container.32
In an eﬀort to gain a better understanding of the mobility of
molecules within the capsule formed by OA 2, the Turro and
Ramamurthy groups used a combination of NMR and EPR
experiments to analyze the movement of encapsulated guests

within diﬀerent complexes.42 Their approach was to classify
guests according to whether not they were capable of rotation
around their X or Z axis, and if so, the temperature required to
do so and whether or not the rotation was faster or slower than
the NMR timescale. The 1H and NOESY NMR data gathered
in this study indicates that as in the case of ethylene glycol
monononyl ether 23, the NMR spectra of complexes of guests
such as 1-methyl-4-(octyloxy)benzene 32 (Fig. 11) show the two
capsule hemispheres to be equivalent. Furthermore, the data
also showed that the guest rotation around the X or Z axis
needed to induce this equivalence did not involve disassembly/
reassembly of the capsule. In addition, the accompanying EPR
studies revealed that, as the guest was increased in length so
the rate of rotation around the Y-axis decreased.
Although not specifically discussed in Section 2.1.1.c, the
binding of n-alkanes from C5 to C17 inside the dimer formed by
OA 2 gave valuable early information about how guests pack
within the capsule.31 Thus, 1H NMR investigations focusing on
the spectral diﬀerence between the free and the bound state of
the guest revealed pole-to-pole guest binding. Because of the
tapering nature of these deep-cavity cavitands, a general rule is
that the more deeply an atom resides in a host the more it is
upfield shifted relative to the free state. Most simply put, at the
base of the pocket the aromatic walls of the host are closest
together and therefore exert the largest shift in the NMR signals
of atoms located there. In contrast, at the equator the greater
separation of the aromatic rings results in smaller upfield
shifts. Hence an evaluation of the Dd value of the free versus
bound signals from the guest gives valuable information
about the time-averaged guest-packing motif within the host
dimer. For all the n-alkane guests examined it was the terminal
methyl groups that displayed the largest Dd value, with upfield
shifts as high as 3.15 ppm in the case of C12. In contrast the
guest protons midway along the alkane chain were the least
shifted, indicating they reside near the equatorial region of
the capsule.
Space-filling models illustrate that C12 is just slightly longer
than the Y-axis of the capsule and can therefore occupy the
cavity in an essentially fully extended conformation (Fig. 12a).
Guests longer than this must however compress somewhat to be
accommodated. Do these compressed guests adopt any distinct
form? NOESY and COSY NMR experiments were also utilized to
elucidate the conformational preferences of these guests, and
the former revealed stronger NOE Ci–Ci+1 and Ci–Ci+2 correla-
tions between the terminal methyl groups and the penultimate
methylenes than for the methylenes at the center of the cavity.
In addition, Ci–Ci+3 and Ci–Ci+4 were also observed with the
longer guests. As with previous work from the Rebek group,43
the inference from this data was that guests such as C14
adopt helical conformations within the cavity of the OA 2 dimer
(Fig. 12b). Models demonstrate that the helical motif allows
both for maximal C–H  p interactions with the cavitand walls
and for maximal packing within the cavity; two factors that
counter the strain of contiguous gauche dihedrals down the
length of the chain.
Two recent papers have demonstrated that other motifs are
also possible. In the first, the Prabhakar and Ramamurthy groups
examined the binding of phenyl-substituted hydrocarbons
(Fig. 13) to the capsule formed by OA 2 using a combination
of NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.44
As expected, small guests such as 33 were found to pack the
cavity in an essentially fully extended manner, with the phenyl
group in one hemisphere and the methyl binding to the polar
region of the other. The case of 34 is very similar, but being 4 Å
longer the guest must adopt a slightly compressed motif and its
movement within the cavity is restricted. At room temperature
the guest signals are broadened somewhat, but these are seen
to sharpen as the temperature is increased. For the longer
guests examined, e.g., 35, both NMR and the MD simulations
demonstrate that these molecules are forced to fold into J- or
U-shaped motifs. Such motifs are frequently observed in fatty
acids bound to fatty acid binding proteins,45 and have also

been observed with similar guests binding to cucurbiturils.46
Overall, it was noted that the inclusion of saturation in the
hydrocarbon sidechain has a pronounced eﬀect on the confor-
mational options available to the guest. In passing, it is perhaps
worth noting that these J- and U-motifs suggest a mechanism by
which the ends of very flexible guests (e.g., Fig. 12c and d) can
exchange hemispheres without complex disassembly.
The second paper in question reveals a further packing motif.
This study concerned a combined study of long n-alkanes within
the capsule formed by OA 2 and the hexalenediamine-linked
dimer (HOA) 36.
This covalently-linked dimer of OA was readily synthesized
by taking advantage of a modification to the esterification of OA
2 (Scheme 1) that gave a high yield of the corresponding hepta-
ester with one free carboxylate group at the rim of the cavitand.
Two equivalents of the hepta-ester were then covalently linked
using 1,6-hexanediamine and HBTU as a coupling agent to give
the corresponding tetradeca-ester, subsequent hydrolysis of
which gave HOA 36.47
The covalent linking of OA 2 in this manner results in a host with
quite diﬀerent assembly modes and subtle diﬀerences in guest
packing. Regarding the former, the possible complexes/assembly
products pertinent to this discussion are: the open 1 : 2 host–
guest complex; the 1 : 1 capsular complex; the 2 : 2 bis-capsule
complex; and the 2 : 2 capsular complex (Scheme 4). The 2 : 2
bis-capsule complex possesses two essentially independent
inner volumes, whereas the 2 : 2 capsular complex possesses a
single inner space more capacious than the 2 : 2 bis-capsule
complex because the internal volume is comprised of the binding
pockets of four cavitands plus a central, pseudo tetrahedral space,
defined by the four cavitands.
As extensive NMR analysis reveals OA 2 and HOA 36 have
quite diﬀerent properties. Earlier work had reported that for
n-alkanes the guest-size limit of OA 2 was C17,31 but this proved
to be largely the result of poor solubility and poor uptake
and not a limiting factor of the host itself. Thus, in this more
recent report a combination of heating and sonication allowed
encapsulation of guests inside of the OA 2 dimer as large as
n-hexacosane (C26). As noted previously, guests up to twelve carbon
atoms (dodecane) adopt extended motifs with contiguous anti
dihedral angles, whereas longer guests adopt a more compressed
motif. These E/C (extended/compressed) motifs cannot be readily
distinguished by NMR, although helical motifs (Fig. 12b) can.
For
alkane
guests
exceeding
eighteen
carbon
atoms
(n-octadecane) it is not possible to pack OA 2 in either of
these motifs. Instead, NMR demonstrates that guests such as
n-eicosane (C20) pack the cavity by adopting a U-shaped motif
(Fig. 12c). This motif holds true for guests up to n-tricosane,
however the largest guests seen to unequivocally bind to the
capsule formed by OA 2 (C24 to C26) cannot adopt this U-shape.
Instead, for these guests the motif appears to be akin to a
spinning-top (Fig. 12d) whereby the two terminal ends of the
alkane chain are nestled in the poles of each cavitand and the
central portion of the hydrophobic chain sandwiched between
the two aromatic rims of the host.

HOA 36 was found to form a 1 : 1 capsular complex in
the presence of short n-alkanes (C6, C8 and C10) as well as
n-hexadecane (C16), and in each case the packing motif of the
guest was as is observed with OA 2. However packing of alkane
chains with eighteen to twenty-three carbons displayed very
diﬀerent binding profiles, while packing of guests with more
than twenty-three carbons did not occur as the linker prevented
suﬃcient separation of the two hemispheres of HOA 36 to allow
the guest to adopt the spinning-top motif.
For the longer alkanes (C18 to C23), NMR experiments
revealed two complexes for each guest: one with a lower energy
E/C conformation and one with a higher energy U-shaped motif.
Unusually, as the guest size was increased so the amount of the
lower energy E/C motif increased. PGSE NMR unraveled this
conundrum. Whereas the diﬀusion constants for the complexes
with the U-shaped motif were the same as for the 1 : 1 complex
between HOA 33 and n-dodecane C12 (D = 1.31  106 cm2 s1),
the complexes with the E/C motif had significantly smaller
diﬀusion rates (D = 0.95  106 cm2 s1) corresponding
to a dimer host structure. Although it was not possible to
unequivocally diﬀerentiate between the 2 : 2 bis-capsule complex
and the 2 : 2 capsular complex (Scheme 4), the 1H NMR data
supported the latter. Furthermore, as the 2 : 2 capsular complex
is necessarily more capacious than the 2 : 2 bis-capsule complex,
this assumption fits with the guest motif changing to a more
relaxed E/C motif as the guest size increases. In summary,
whereas OA 2 accommodates very large guests by adopting a
high energy spinning-top motif (the motif of last resort), HOA 36
accommodates such guests by switching from a 1 : 1 capsular
complex to a more voluminous 2 : 2 capsular complex.
We complete this section by noting that it is not just highly
flexible guests than can be persuaded to adopt unusual conforma-
tions or motifs within the confines of these supramolecular
capsules. For example, a comprehensive NMR examination of
piperidine derivatives 37–41 (Fig. 14) revealed that the conforma-
tional preferences of 37, and 39–41 within the capsule formed by
OA 2 were similar to that seen in solutions; these guests adopt a
conformation in which the OR group is exclusively equatorial.48
On the other hand, when 38 is encapsulated within the OA 2
dimer it adopts a 53 : 47 mixture of the equatorial and axial
conformers that interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale.
Apparently, the n-Pr group is just the right size to reduce
the energy difference between the more stable equatorial con-
former and the axial form, where as an ethyl group is too small
and a n-butyl group too big. Such precise control of one molecule
in a homologous series suggests interesting possibilities vis-a`-vis
reaction control (see Section 2.1.2.b).
( f ) Communication through the capsule. As has been reviewed,
when a guest is bound inside the dimer formed by OA 2 it is not
completely isolated from the bulk. Thus even during occupancy,
guests can be exposed to small co-guests such as molecular
oxygen via capsule ‘breathing’. Furthermore, as we highlight in
this section, direct communication between bound guests and
the bulk is also possible through the walls of the host.
The communication between molecules entrapped within the
OA 2 dimer and molecules in free solution has been extensively
investigated. As detailed below, to date the following systems
have been explored: (1) confined excited singlet or triplet donors
and a free acceptor (respectively singlet-singlet and triplet–triplet
energy transfers); (2) a confined radical and one free in the bulk
(spin–spin exchange); (3) an encapsulated, excited molecule and
a radical in free solution; (4) internalized fluorescence resonance
energy donors and external acceptors (FRET), and; (5) confined
electron donors and free acceptors (electron transfer).
The Turro group has led investigations into the ability of
guests inside the capsule to ‘communicate’ through the walls
of the host with guests in bulk solution.49 The first example of
communication involved a superexchange process whereby the
orbitals of a guest nitroxide interact with those of a nitroxide
solute in free solution through the bond orbitals of the host.
The guests utilized for this study were 42 and 43 (Fig. 15).
Encapsulation of paramagnetic guest 14N labeled 42 inside the
capsule lead to broadening of the 1H NMR spectrum of the
complex. Although this is good evidence of complex formation,
conformation of guest internalization was sought using 14N
labeled diamagnetic guest 43. This similarly sized molecule
resulted in a 2 : 1 host–guest complex that was readily charac-
terized by 1H NMR. Subsequent analysis of the Electron Para-
magnetic Resonance (EPR) rotational correlation times and
hyperfine coupling constants for the complex between OA 2 dimer
and the 14N labeled 42 confirmed encapsulation. As anticipated
by the researchers, EPR studies of the capsular complex of
diamagnetic 14N guest 43 demonstrated that positively charged
14N labeled solute 44 bound to the outside of the capsule, but
the negatively charged 45 did not. Furthermore, using the
capsular complex containing the 15N paramagnetic guest 42,
EPR demonstrated a strong electron spin-electron spin inter-
action between the encapsulated guest and the cationic 14N
solute 44. As expected however, the same experiment using the
anionic 14N solute 45 indicated no interaction with the anionic
capsular complex.
Building on this steady-state EPR work, the Turro and
Ramamurthy groups used time-resolved EPR to gain a better
understanding of superexchange between an encapsulated guest
and a solute.50 Key to this work was the encapsulation complex
formed between 15N thioxanthone guest 46 (Fig. 15) and the
dimeric capsule formed by OA 2. Steady state EPR spectroscopy
demonstrated that encapsulated 15N 46 possessed the expected
increased rotational correlation time and decreased hyperfine

coupling constant (relative to free solution) indicative of
restricted motion within a non-polar environment. Separately,
transient triplet–triplet absorption measurements upon 14N 46
and 47 in acetonitrile revealed that upon irradiation at 355 nm
their thioxanthone moieties were readily excited to the triplet
state, but that in this case of 14N 46 this was rapidly quenched
by the adjacent nitroxide. Furthermore, time-resolved EPR of
14N 46 in acetonitrile (355 nm, 5 ns) demonstrated that during
this quenching process the spin-polarized triplet states of the
thioxanthone moiety transferred their spin polarization to
the nitroxide. A similar time-resolved EPR experiment with
15N guest 46 encapsulated within the OA 2 dimer revealed the
same phenomenon, but that confinement resulted in a longer
spin polarization lifetime for the nitroxide. Following this, an
analogous experiment but with the addition of 14N solute 44
in bulk solution demonstrated that spin polarization of the
incarcerated guest could be transferred to the cationic solute.
Thus the time-resolved EPR kinetic traces of spin polarization
for both the 15N guest 46 and the 14N solute 44 revealed a
reduced lifetime of the former, and a delayed rise-time of the
spin polarization of the latter. That association with the outside of
the capsule is key was demonstrated in two ways: by the addition
of cucurbit[8]uril that strongly sequesters 44, or by using anionic
guest 45 that is repelled from the surface of the host. In both
cases no superexchange between encapsulated guest and solute
occurred. As excited thioxanthone 47 and benzil 30 (Fig. 9)
guests led to opposite signs of spin polarization of nitroxides, it
was concluded that the principle mechanism for the formation
of polarized nitroxides involved the electron spin polarization
transfer mechanism.51
A diﬀerent viewpoint on the barrier engendered by the
wall of the capsule formed by OA was obtained by examining
the communication (exited spin state-radical spin transfer)
between solutes 44, 45 and 48, and a range of eight internalized
guests including benzil 30 (Fig. 9), thione 49, and stilbene 50
(R = 4-Me, Fig. 15). The cationic, anionic and neutral states of
the nitroxide radicals 44, 45 and 48 allowed control of the
lifetime of the solute-capsule encounter complex, and in the
case of the cationic solute 44 NMR signal relaxation times
suggested that it specifically associates at the equator of the
capsule. These results also suggested that 48 has no specific
interaction with the capsule, whilst not unexpectedly 45 is
repelled from it. Although the guests examined formed both
2 : 2 and 2 : 1 host–guest complexes and formed a range of excited
states, quenching of the excited, entrapped guest by the nitroxide
solute 44 revealed only two distinct systems: (1) triplet states that
are quenched dynamically by cationic nitroxide 44; (2) triplet and
excited singlet states that are quenched via a static process.
Moreover, the decay curves and lifetimes of the encapsulated,
excited state guests revealed that regardless of the lifetime of the
former, they are quenched with almost identical rate constants.
In contrast the latter group all have short (o5 ms) lifetimes.
En masse, a detailed analysis of these results supported the
hypothesis that if a guest relaxed more slowly than 5 ms then
its relaxation is controlled by through the wall quenching as a
result of diffusion controlled encounter complexes, whereas
guests with lifetimes shorter than 5 ms undergo static relaxation
in the cavity of the capsule.
As an alternative to this short range (Dexter type) super-
exchange, the Ramamurthy group have used femtosecond (fs)
up-conversion to study longer range Fo¨rster resonance energy
transfers (FRET) between an encapsulated donor and an cationic
acceptor associating with the outer surface of the OA 2 capsule.52
In these experiments the (bound) donors were coumarin dyes
such as 51, whilst the acceptor in free solution was rhodamine
6G 52 (Fig. 15). A combination of steady-state fluorescence and
1H NMR confirmed that the diﬀerent donors examined were
bound within the dry interior of the capsule, whilst fluorescence,

1H, and diﬀusion NMR spectroscopies revealed that the cationic
acceptor had an aﬃnity for the outside of the negatively
charged capsule.
The accompanying time-resolved fluorescence studies invol-
ving the encapsulated coumarin dye and the externally bound
52 revealed a rapid decay of the excited state of the donor.
This was attributed to an ultrafast FRET process arising from
the close proximity of donor and acceptor; a hypothesis that
was confirmed by the rapid rise on the acceptor emission
observed in a fs up-conversion experiment. Calculations from
these studies suggested that the donor–acceptor distance in
these systems was a mere 13 Å.
It is not only spin and energy that can be transferred through
the walls of the capsule formed by OA 2; electron transfer is
also possible. In a step towards this, the Kaifer group examined
the properties of encapsulated ferrocene 53 (Fig. 16).53 A combi-
nation of 1H and PGSE NMR experiments demonstrated that 53
formed a 2 : 1 host–guest complex with OA 2. Neither cyclic
voltammetry (CV) nor square-wave voltammetry (SWV) detected
any faradaic response from the encapsulated 53, and a series of
experiments varying the host–guest ratio indicate that inside
the OA 2 dimer the guest does not give rise to a measurable
current–potential response.
Whereas ferrocene 53 is strongly bound within the host
capsule, 1H and PGSE NMR clearly showed that methyl, ethyl,
and n-butyl viologen 54 (R = Me, Et and n-Bu respectively) bind
to the exterior of empty OA 2 dimer. Indeed, two molecules of
viologen bind to this empty capsule, suggesting that the
four carboxylates at each pole are the viologen-specific binding
site. That noted, this was the first example of an empty
capsule formed by OA 2; all work prior, and the vast majority
of subsequent work, demonstrates that an internalized guest
is required for capsule formation. These facts suggest that
there is also likely association of the viologens with the equa-
torial carboxylates of the capsule that helps to hold the empty
capsule together.
CV studies of viologens 54 associated with OA 2 demonstrate
the two expected reduction steps (to radical cation and then
to the neutral), but with substantially reduced current levels.
Furthermore, these studies revealed that the host stabilized both
the reduced forms; particularly the first (cationic) reduction
product. Furthermore, the rates of heterogeneous electron
transfer for the viologens associated with the OA 2 dimer were
significantly attenuated relative to free solution. This was
attributed to the association between the anionic poles of the
OA 2 capsule and the viologen increasing the average distance
of maximum approach between the viologen center and the
electrode surface.
Subsequently it was shown that the capsule formed by
the dimerization of OA 2 around ferrocene 53 could also
(externally) bind ethyl viologen (54, R = Et) to form the corre-
sponding quinternary complex.
The Kaifer group subsequently built on this work by demon-
strating cationic ferrocene derivative 55 (Fig. 16) associates
strongly with the outer surface of the OA 2 capsule containing
ferrocene 53, and that this quaternary complex can undergo
a homogeneous electron transfer process.54 PGSE NMR con-
firmed the quaternary complex, yielding very similar diﬀusion
coeﬃcients from signals corresponding to the capsular complex
and 55. A similar situation was obtained if (E)-stilbene (50, R = H)
replaced the internalized guest 53.
When the voltammetric behavior of the quaternary assembly
was investigated with the encapsulated stilbene, the current
levels were depressed relative to 55 alone. However, when stilbene
was replaced by guest 53 a number of changes to the cyclic
voltammogram were observed. On the forward scan, there was no
faradaic response detected where 53 would be directly oxidized,
but the oxidation of 55 was observed, albeit at higher current
levels than expected. Furthermore, on the reverse scan, two peaks
were observed: one corresponding to the reduction of the ferro-
cenium form of 55, and a second corresponding to the reduction
of ferrocenium form of 53. The results demonstrate that once
oxidized, the ferrocenium form of 55 accepts an electron from the
internalized 53, to generate the cation (ferrocenium) form 53
inside the capsule. However, this guest is a poor one and it is
released to bulk solution. This process was fully reversible and so
the OA 2 capsule containing 53 was again formed upon
reduction. Control experiments were also carried out with 56.
In this instance, there were no changes in the CV response in the
presence of the OA 2 dimer encapsulating either (E)-stilbene 50
(R = H) or 53. Furthermore, the complex of 55 with cucurbit[7]uril
was determined to be a poor promoter of the electron transfer
process in the system where 55 needs to associate with the outer
walls of the OA 2 dimer. Clearly, there must be close association
between the internalized and external ferrocene derivatives for
electron transfer to occur.
A second example of redox-controlled capsular assembly/
disassembly from the Kaifer group focused on tetrathiaful-
valene (TTF) 57 (Fig. 16) encapsulated inside the OA 2 dimer.55
As anticipated, 1H and PGSE NMR demonstrated that 57 formed
the corresponding 2:1 complex. These studies were performed at
1 mM concentrations, and therefore the complex represents a
much higher concentration of 57 ‘in water’ than is usually possible.
Tetrathiafulvalene 57 and its derivatives undergo two con-
secutive one-electron oxidations to first generate the corresponding

radical cation and eventually the dication form at more positive
potentials. However the first oxidation is usually poorly devel-
oped in water because of the low solubility of 57.
The electrochemical behavior of this OA 2 dimer complex
containing 57 was analyzed by both CV and SWV. In the
absence of OA 2, two shallow waves at +0.18 V and +0.48 V
were observed in the forward scan of the cyclic voltammogram,
and no peaks were apparent on the reverse scan. This is
consistent with the behavior of 57 in aqueous solution. However,
in the presence of two equivalents of OA 2, the small initial
current corresponding to the first oxidation step disappeared
entirely and there was a well-developed peak corresponding to
the second oxidation process at +0.56 V. In the reverse scan only
one small wave was observed corresponding to the second
reduction to regenerate neutral 57. The SWV trace confirmed
the hindered voltammetric response associated with encapsu-
lated 57, which was attributed to the increased distance between
it (versus free TTF) and the electrode surface. In contrast, the
well-developed second oxidation process was attributed to the
release of the cationic form of 57. The solitary, small peak
observed in the reverse process was attributed to the dicationic
form of 54 being unstable under basic conditions. Larger tetra-
thiafulvalene derivatives were also examined in this study, but
they were found to not bind to the host.
More recently, electron transfer across the walls of the OA 2
capsule has also been observed by the Ramamurthy group.56 To
demonstrate this, one donor–acceptor pair ideally suited to the
capsule formed by OA 2 is 4,40-dimethylstilbene 50 (R = 4-Me,
Fig. 15) and N-methyl pyridinium 58 or viologen 54 (R = Me,
Fig. 16). 1H NMR demonstrated that electron donor 50 is strongly
encapsulated within the capsule, whilst diffusion NMR revealed
that both 54 (R = Me) and 58 associated with the exterior of the
capsule via Coulombic forces. Fluorescence spectroscopic analy-
sis of the titration of 54 or 58 into a solution of encapsulated 50
revealed that the pyridinium solutes statically quenched the
fluorescence of the encapsulated guest. Laser flash photolysis
pin-pointed the cause of this quenching, namely the transient
formation of the radical cation of 50. The presence of two
transient absorptions (at 510 and 4700 nm) with identical decay
kinetics suggested that the quenching was due to electron
transfer from the singlet excited state of 50 to 54 or 58. In the
case of viologen 54 (R = Me) it was also possible to observe the
mono-cation radical ‘product’ resulting from electron transfer.
Further supporting electron transfer were similar fluorescence
and transient absorption experiments in the presence of cucur-
bit[7]uril (CB7). CB7 is a strong binder of viologen 54 (R = Me),
and consequently its addition restored fluorescence of the inter-
nalized 50, and quenched the observed transient absorption.
Laser flash photolysis also revealed that the lifetime of the radical
cation of 50 was o20 ns in the presence of 54 (R = Me) and 4.6 ms
in the presence of 58. This difference was attributed to the fact
that the single electron reduction product of the latter is neutral
but mono-cationic in the former, and that the mono-cation has a
relatively strong affinity with the exterior of the capsule.
Building on this work, photo-induced electron transfer has
been recently demonstrated using TiO2 as an acceptor.57 In this
work, the encapsulated donors were a series of three coumarins
including guest 29 (Fig. 8) whilst for solution studies viologen
54 (R = Me) was again used as the acceptor that partitioned
between bulk solution and the outer wall of the capsule. As
anticipated, titration of the acceptor 54 (R = Me) into a solution
of the capsular complex resulted in static quenching of the
fluorescence of the donor 29, but that fluorescence could be
recovered by the addition of a strong binder of 54 (R = Me) such
as CB7. With this knowledge in hand, the emersion of films of
TiO2 (and as a control ZrO2 films) into solutions of the capsular
complex lead to the complex adhering to the surface of
the oxides (Fourier Transform, Infra-Red Attenuated Total
Reflection spectroscopy, FT-IR-ATR). Furthermore, in the case
of the large band-gap ZrO2 film where electron transfer is not
possible, fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that adherence to
the surface did not induce capsular breakup and release of the
coumarin. In contrast, adherence to the TiO2 film resulted in
full quenching of the coumarin indicative of electron transfer.
Finally, titration of TiO2 into a solution of the capsular complex
of OA 2 and the coumarins was achieved by using colloidal TiO2.
In this experiment the reduction in fluorescence suggested that
quenching was again static rather than dynamic.
In a recent collaboration between the Burda and Ramamurthy
groups the ultrafast electron transfer dynamics of these processes
have been investigated using femtosecond laser spectroscopy.58
In these studies coumarin-153 (51, Fig. 15) was used as the
encapsulated donor, whilst once more viologen 54 (R = Me) and
N-methyl pyridinium 58 (Fig. 16) served as the solute acceptors.
The transient absorption spectra obtained using a 390 nm
pump pulse confirmed the existence of the oxidized state of
the internal excited guest and the reduced state of viologen 54
(R = Me) associating with the outside of the cavity. A kinetic
analysis of the increase of the radical cation of 54 (R = Me) as a
function of time, and the corresponding decay of the laser
induced fluorescence of the excited donor 51, gave time con-
stants of t = 20  1 and 18  2 ps respectively. Furthermore, the
recombination kinetics were measured at t = 724  38 ps.
These results were in sharp contrast with those obtained in free
(30% aqueous acetonitrile) solution, where the electron transfer
rate was much lower (t = 631  50 ps) and almost identical to
the recombination rate.
2.1.2
Applications for deep-cavity cavitands and their
assemblies
(a) Novel separations strategies. The preferred encapsulation of
one guest over another within molecular containers – differential
compartmentalization – offers many intriguing possibilities
vis-a`-vis molecular separations. Examples of both physical
and chemical-based separations have been documented with
the deep-cavity cavitands discussed here. With respect to the
former, the Gibb group has reported on the separation of
hydrocarbon gases using dimeric capsules formed by OA 2.21
This study demonstrated (1H NMR) that when n-butane was
added to the headspace above a buffered solution of OA 2, the
corresponding 2 : 2 capsular complex was formed in solution.

solubility in pure water. The actual physical limit of solubility of
this complex may be even higher than this as it was viscosity
issues with the chosen sodium tetraborate buffer that restricted
NMR analysis. NMR was also used to determine the stability of
the 2 : 2 host–butane complex. As it was not possible to differ-
entiate between the free host and guest and their 1 : 1 complex,
an apparent K value was defined as: Kapp = [H2G2]/[Ha][Ga], with
[Ha] = [Hfree + HG] and [Ga] = [Gfree + HG]. Values for Kapp ranged
from 1400 M1 in simple buffer solution to 1  106 M1 in 14 mM
NaCl. A subsequent competition experiment between propane
and n-butane demonstrated that the latter bound an order of
magnitude more strongly (Krel = 12), and this led to an investiga-
tion to determine whether or not the two gases could be
separated. This was indeed the case. Thus, when the head-space
above a solution of OA 2 was filled with a 1 : 1 mixture of propane
and n-butane, only the latter was complexed leaving a propane-
enriched gas-phase in the head space.
The Gibb group has also demonstrated an example of
a chemical separation using these types of supramolecular
capsules.59 The focus of this report was on the supramolecular
protection of molecules from reactive (hydrolytic) media. More
specifically, pairs of diﬃcult to separate, constitutionally iso-
meric esters were examined in basic media. The idea behind
this work was that one guest would be preferentially bound to
the capsule formed from OA 2, leaving the other molecule of
the pair to reside in solution and undergo hydrolysis. Hence the
supramolecular nanocapsules formed by OA 2 would bias
the relative rates of ester hydrolysis and bring about kinetic
resolution.59 Two series of constitutional esters were examined:
those composed of thirteen non-hydrogen atoms, and those
composed of sixteen non-hydrogen atoms. The former were
chosen in part because previously reported data31 suggested that
dodecane and tridecane optimally fill the cavitand by neither
being too compressed or by having too much empty space. The
latter series was a test of what happens to a resolution at the
limit of guest encapsulation. The obtained kinetic resolutions
were highest with those composed of thirteen non-hydrogen
atoms (Fig. 17, 59–63) and therefore are the primary focus of
our discussion here.
The free esters were hydrolyzed in 3 : 7 acetone-d6 : D2O con-
taining 10 mM NaOH to obtain the pseudo first-order hydrolysis
rates at room temperature. The methyl ester 59, and to a lesser
extent the ethyl ester 60, hydrolyzed slightly faster than the
others, but the relative rate (krel) between the fastest (59) and
slowest (62 and 63) was only three, i.e., insuﬃcient for kinetic
resolution in itself. 1H NMR and COSY NMR were conducted to
determine the goodness of the fit of the guests in the series,
and all were found to form strong 2 : 1 complexes within the
OA 2 dimer. The relative binding constants (Krel) between all the
esters were then determined, with the strongest and weakest
binding guests found to be 59 and 61 respectively (Krel for esters
59–63 were respectively: 165.4 1.8 1.0 10.7 16.4). Two key factors
were concluded to influence binding. First, the relative position
of the ester group within the cavity presents significant steric
clash as it is moved closer to the end of the molecule and hence
deeper into the pole-region of the capsule. Second, this steric
clash is overcome by compensatory –CH3  p interactions
between the methyl of the guest and the walls of the host when
the C–H bonds are more polarized by a proximal electronegative
atom (the sp3 O atom). Hence the methyl ester 59 binds
strongest, the ethyl- and propyl-esters 60 and 61 the weakest,
and the butyl and pentyl-esters 62 and 63 have intermediate
affinity. It was noted in the corresponding experiments with
the second set of esters that the range of binding affinities was
essentially half that found in the first series, presumably because
of increased steric strain in the more tightly packed cavity.
Competition experiments between pairs of esters were then
carried out in the presence of the capsule formed by OA 2. As it
was noted for a complex of a single ester that even after one
month r5% hydrolysis had occurred at room temperature, all
competition experiments were carried out at 100 1C. After
cooling of each sample the extent of hydrolysis was determined
by NMR. When pairs of esters were competed against each
other it was determined that for esters with similar Krel kinetic
resolution was not possible, but for those with Krel an order of
magnitude or more diﬀerent, fair to good kinetic resolution of
isomers was observed. Larger Krel diﬀerences still led to very
good resolutions. Thus, the best resolution was determined
between 59 (the strongest binder) and 61 (the weakest). In this
case when all of the latter had reacted, 84% of the former still
remained. Subsequent studies in the presence and absence of
host indicated that although the rate-determining step in the
hydrolysis of free ester is nucleophilic attack by hydroxide, this
was not the case for the encapsulated ester where instead the
rate-determining step was likely capsule opening. To test this,
the authors added a stronger-binding, inert guest (n-dodecane,
C12) as they monitored the slow hydrolysis of 61; almost
immediately following injection the ester was displaced, and
hydrolyzed within 10 minutes. Furthermore, using the projected
kinetic data for hydrolysis of free ester at 100 1C (via Arrhenius
plots), a model based on the notion that capsule opening was
the rate-determining step fitted well with the kinetic traces of
ester hydrolysis in the presence of a capsule. Overall, these

studies demonstrated that kinetic resolutions can be brought
about via selective molecular protection; selective binding one
of the reactive molecules biases reactions that, in the absence
of the capsule, are otherwise very similar.
(b) As nano-scale reactors. As the last example of the previous
section demonstrated, encapsulation can protect molecules
from reactive external environments. The opposite of this
strategy is to use the inner nano-space of capsules as yoctoliter
(1024 L) reaction vessels; a popular topic in supramolecular
chemistry,60 and one we discuss in this section.
The vast majority of chemical conversions carried out in
the capsules discussed here involve OA 2 and photochemistry.
A collaboration between the Gibb and Ramamurthy groups
established the foundation for these studies, and from this
the Ramamurthy group have built up a flourishing deep-cavity
cavitand program within their field of expertise of studying
photophysical and photochemical processes within confined media.
Arguably the most studied reaction within the capsule
formed by OA has been the photolysis of dibenzyl ketone
derivatives; a class of reaction that has shed much light on
the ability of capsules formed by OA 2 to bring about unusual
photochemical reactions. By way of example,38 the photolysis of
ketone 64 (Scheme 5) in aqueous solution gave, via homolytic
cleavage of the C(O)–C bond and decarbonylation, products 65
(AA) 66 (AB) and 67 (BB) in the expected (statistical) 1 : 2 : 1 ratio.
In contrast, irradiation of 64 encapsulated within the OA 2
dimer led to only type AB products because the radical formed
from 64 are – in the timeframe of the photochemical conver-
sion – trapped within the capsule. This exceedingly high (100%)
cage effect had only previously been observed in the solid-state.
More interestingly, the major products formed from encapsulated
64 were identified as rearrangement product 68 (44%), 66 (41%),
and a mixture of various decarbonylated, ortho substituted
derivatives such as 69 (15% combined yield). Compound 68 is
believed to be formed (Fig. 18) via cleavage of the C(O)–C bond,
intersystem crossing from the triplet to the singlet radical
pair, rapid reorientation of the unsubstituted benzyl radical,
recombination and a 1,5 H-shift. Reorientation occurs because
whereas the phenylacetyl radical is anchored in place by its
p-methyl group, the benzyl radical isn’t. Consequently, it
rotates 1801 relative to rest of the complex to better pack the
cavity and place the benzyl group in the narrow region at the
base of the nano-space. A hydrogen shift and recombination of
the radicals gives product 68.
Extending this work, the Gibb and Ramamurthy groups
examined a-(n-alkyl) dibenzyl ketones 70 (Scheme 6) where R
varied from Me to n-octyl. Extensive NMR analysis including
1H studies, diﬀusion, and 2D experiments revealed all guests
formed 2 : 1 host–guest complexes with three distinct packing

groups (R = Me, Et, n-Pr) it was found that each phenyl ring
occupied the polar regions of the container whilst the R group
occupied the equatorial region (Fig. 19). In contrast, for mid-sized

R groups (R = n-Bu n-pentyl and n-hexyl) it was found that one
phenyl ring (distal to the R group) and the R group occupied the
polar regions of the container and the proximal phenyl ring
occupied the equatorial region. Finally, in the case of the largest
R groups examined (R = n-heptyl and n-octyl) it was found that the
guest packed the cavity such that the distal phenyl ring occupies
the equatorial region of the capsule.
In hexane or buﬀer solution the majority of products from
photolysis of these eight ketones arise via Norrish Type I
mechanisms and indicate no cage eﬀect. In contrast, photolysis
within the capsule revealed again a 100% cage eﬀect with only
AB type products observed. Nevertheless, the relationship
between the packing of the capsule and the outcome of photo-
lysis was complex because of the multiple chemical channels
in the triplet excited-state surface. Consequently, the guests
examined yielded a considerable range of products arising from
both Norrish Type I and Norrish Type II (Norrish–Yang) chemistry.
Prominent examples include rearranged products 71, 72 and
decarbonylated product 73 via Norrish Type 1 mechanisms, and
dealkylated (Norrish–Yang) products such as 74.
Although overall many products were formed, the range of
products from individual host–guest complexes was much
narrower than in free solution and some general conclusions
regarding packing and reactivity were possible. First, smaller R
groups (R = Me, Et, and n-Pr) formed substantial amounts of
rearranged product 72 and only trace amounts of the other
rearranged product 71. This was attributed to the faster
cleavage of the more substituted C(O)–C bond of 70, and the
fact that the resulting substituted benzyl radicals from the
three guests were able to rotate in the cavity and generate 72.
On the other hand, midsized R groups (n-butyl and n-pentyl)
give roughly equal amounts of both rearranged products 71
and 72. Although the cleavage of the more substituted C(O)–C
bond of 70 would be expected to the faster, apparently the
reorientation of the resulting substituted benzyl radical is difficult.
Consequently, via recombination of the initially formed phenacetyl
and benzyl radicals, the slower cleaving C(O)–C bond that is the
first step to product 72 effectively competes. Finally, the largest
R groups (n-hexyl through n-octyl) gave the most Norrish–Yang
products such as 73. This was attributed to two phenomena: (1)
with little space in the cavity, Type I chemistry and rearrange-
ment processes were disfavored; (2) the conformation preference
(Fig. 19) for these guests promotes g-hydrogen abstraction and
Type II chemistry.
A diﬀerent perspective on this encapsulation chemistry was
obtained with the series of dibenzyl ketones 75 (R = Et through
n-hexyl, Scheme 7).61 With 75, the outcome of photolysis in
hexanes (Scheme 7) is independent of the nature of the R
group, with in all cases, a statistical mixture (1 : 2 : 1) of the
AA, AB, and BB decarbonylated products 76–78. In the case of
the encapsulated reactions all the products were again of the
AB type (100% cage effect), with the predominant products
being 77, 79, 80 and 81. In general, yields of 79 decreased and
those of 77 increased as R increased in size, suggesting that
with larger and larger R groups rotation of the intermediate
benzyl radical became energetically more demanding and the
decarbonylation pathway became more competitive. Yields of
80 and 81 were less dependent on the R group size, suggesting
that the increase in yield of decarbonylated 77 is at the expense
of rearrangement product 79.
One question that the photolysis of these diﬀerent type of
dibenzylketones does not reveal is the extent of recombination
of the phenylacetyl and benzyl radicals to regenerate the starting
ketone (Fig. 18). To address this question a recent study examined
the photolysis of optically pure a-deoxybenzoins (Scheme 8)
encapsulated within the dimer capsule formed by OA 2.62 These
guests can only undergo cleavage on one side of the carbonyl
group, and so photolysis of these complexes forms a narrower
range of products. With 82 (R = H) only Type I reactions are
possible and the rearranged product 83 (R = H) was formed
quantitatively. Guest 82 (R = Et) formed mostly 83 (R = Et), but
also the Type II products 84 (R1 = Me) and 85. In contrast, guests
82 (R = n-pentyl and n-heptyl) gave no Type I products but only 84
(respectively R1 = n-Bu and n-pentyl) and 85. Equally important,
in all cases if photolysis was kept to o20% the recovered starting

material was found to have undergone partial racemization; a
phenomenon that necessitates the first step of the Type I
mechanism, i.e., formation of the phenylacetyl benzyl radical
pair. Two key observations were made from the data: (1) longer
chain lengths led to reduced extents of racemization; (2) but
even with guests 82 (R = n-pentyl and n-heptyl) which gave no
Type I products, the first step of the Type I mechanisms is not
suppressed. Overall these studies revealed that the reduction of
free space in the complex with increasing R group significantly
decreases the ability of the guest to undergo Type I chemistry
and rearrangement—100% yield of 83 for 82 (R = H), 0% for 82
(R = n-pentyl and n-heptyl)—but the eﬀect of packing coeﬃcient
on the formation of the phenylacetyl/benzyl radical pair and
subsequent racemization is much smaller 75 : 25 er versus
88 : 12 er for 82 (R = H and n-heptyl respectively). In other
words, formation of the phenylacetyl benzyl radical pair occurs
with all guests, but increasing packing coeﬃcient has more of
an eﬀect on the rearrangement reaction to form 83 than on
flipping of the benzyl radical necessary for racemization.
Studies of the photophysical and photochemical properties
of encapsulated stilbenes also reveals that the cavity formed by
the dimerization of OA 2 has a profound eﬀect on encapsulated
guest molecules.63 In this work the authors examined a series
of cis- and trans-methyl stilbenes (2-, 3- and 4-substituted) as
well as dimethyl stilbenes (2,20-, 3,30-, and 4,40-) 50. (Fig. 15).
NMR studies demonstrated that both cis- and trans-stilbenes
readily form 2 : 1 host–guest complexes, with the latter more
efficiently filling the nano-space of the capsule. Furthermore,
the NMR shift data between the free and the bound states
suggested that it was the 4,40-disubstituted stilbene that
demonstrated the greatest difference between the cis- and
trans-isomers; the more rotund form of the former guest only
filled the ‘equatorial’ region of the capsule, whereas the shape
of the latter was sufficient to more efficiently fill the bulk of the
interior, and in particular, allow its two methyl groups to bind
deeply into the narrow ‘polar’ regions of the nano-space.
Fluorescence studies revealed that the stilbenes displayed
weak aggregate emission in free borate solution, but well-
defined monomer emission when encapsulated. Furthermore,
the singlet lifetime of all the disubstituted guests was longer
than the corresponding values in hexanes solution (the corre-
sponding lifetimes of the mono-substituted stilbenes were too
short to measure).
Photochemical studies revealed that the 4,40-dimethyl stilbene
50 (R = 4-Me) was unique among all the diﬀerent isomers
examined. Free in hexane solution or bound in the capsule,
irradiation of the other isomers led to similar cis/trans ratios in
the pseudo-photostationary states (Scheme 9). However, in the
case of 4,40-dimethyl stilbene 50 its pseudo-photostationary state
in hexane was 18% trans and 76% cis, but (a more slowly attained)
85% trans and 15% cis in the capsule. Furthermore, whereas
irradiation in hexane led to high yields of the corresponding
phenanthrene 31, only trace amounts of 31 formed over extended
irradiation of the bound 4,40-dimethyl stilbene 50. These results
demonstrated that the two methyl groups of the guest are uniquely
positioned to anchor the two ends of the guest in the nano-space
of the capsule, inhibiting the formation of the preferred cis-isomer
and so preventing the formation of the expected phenanthrene 31.
A recent related paper examined the photophysical and
photochemical properties of an expanded array of encapsulated

stilbene and stilbene-like guests molecules.64 In this work, the
photostationary states of the diﬀerent guests were attained via a
second OA 2 capsular complex containing a triplet sensitizer.
A comparison of qualitative competition studies for the encap-
sulation of the diﬀerent cis/trans isomers, with the photo-
stationary state ratios obtained upon photolysis suggested that
the latter is biased in the capsule by the relative binding aﬃnities
of the guests. Models explaining the mechanism by which energy
is transferred from the encapsulated, excited donor and the
encapsulated acceptor were discussed.
A number of other photochemical transformations have
been investigated within the confines of the dimeric capsule
formed by OA 2. For example, the dimerization of acenaphthy-
lene 86 in water gives 40% of the syn-dimer and 60% of the anti
stereoisomer (Scheme 10). In the capsule however the syn-dimer is
formed quantitatively.65 Interestingly, when the water-soluble tri-
plet sensitizer Eosin-Y is added to the reaction, in the case of free
86 the syn:anti ratio is 51:49, and in the case of the encapsulated
86 60:40. The authors tentatively ascribe this increase in the yield
of the anti isomer in the presence of Eosin-Y to the increase in the
triplet lifetime of 86 in the presence of the sensitizer. As a result,
the triplet state of 86 may be able to exit the cavity and undergo
reaction in free solution. Building on this concept, the general
ability of the OA 2 dimer to control photo-dimerization reactions
has been illustrated with methyl cinnamates, p-methyl styrene,
indene, and 4,4-dimethylcyclohex-2-enone.66
The familiar photo-Fries reaction has also been studied
within the confines of the dimer capsule of OA 2.67 In organic
solvents the Photo-Fries reaction can produce a bewildering array
of products. For example, the naphthyl esters examined by the
authors (Scheme 11) gave as many as nine products depending
on the nature of the R group. However, in the confines of the
capsule formed by OA 2 the three esters examined, 87–89 all gave
quantitative yields of their respective rearranged products 90–92.
As the authors noted, such selectivity in the Photo-Fries reaction
had only been observed in zeolites, and suggests little transla-
tional and rotational freedom for the excited singlet state and
subsequent b-cleavage process.
A fascinating example of the control of a photochemical
reaction is the selective oxidation of olefins by singlet oxygen
within the OA 2 capsule.68 Alkenes with multiple allylic posi-
tions normally react indiscriminately with singlet oxygen via
addition to the double bond and simultaneous abstraction of
an allylic hydrogen. However, when alkenes such as 1-methyl
cyclohexene were exposed to solutions of OA 2 a 2 : 2 host–
guest complex was spontaneously formed in which each guest
adopted a specific orientation with its methyl group filling the
narrow polar region of the inner space (Fig. 20). As a result, only
the C-3 allylic position is accessible via partial opening of the
capsule (see Section 2.1.1.d).
In this system singlet oxygen was generated using two sensi-
tizers: water-soluble Rose Bengal (Fig. 20), and water insoluble

dimethyl benzil (30, Fig. 9). The latter was itself made water-
soluble by encapsulation within an OA 2 capsule. Although
mixing of the capsular complexes of substrate and sensitizer 30
did not result in the formation of any hetero-guest complex,
irradiation at 500 nm successfully oxidized the encapsulated
substrate to give a 95% yield of the product peroxide arising
from C-3 abstraction. Elucidation of the mechanism for this
conversion began with an examination of the encapsulated
dimethyl benzil 30 on its own. Thus, lifetime measurements
of singlet oxidation generated by this capsule were 5 and 41 ms
in water and D2O respectively, indicating that singlet oxygen
spends most of its time in free solution. Next, the rate constant
for oxygen induced quenching of the triplet excited state of
encapsulated 30 was determined. Two diﬀerent approaches
gave very similar results; the rate was approximately one order
of magnitude slower than diﬀusion, but faster than through-
the-wall energy transfer observed with hemicarcerands.69 These
results suggest that energy transfer from the encapsulated
(triplet) guest to oxygen involves partial opening of the container
to allow oxygen to enter the capsule, a mechanism facilitated by
the relatively long lifetime of the excited sensitizer. Indeed, as
was discussed in Section 2.1.1.d, sensitizers with much shorter
lifetimes were only slightly aﬀected by the presence of oxygen in
solution. Based on this information, the overall mechanism
proposed involved: (1) generation of triplet encapsulated 30, (2)
capsule breathing to allow contact between oxygen and excited
30 and subsequent energy transfer; (3) exit of singlet oxygen from
the capsule into bulk solution; and (4) entry of singlet oxygen
into the capsule containing the alkene and regioselective
oxidation.
Two papers detailing chiral photochemistry within the cap-
sule formed by OA 2 have also been reported. In the first, the 4e
disrotatory cyclization of pyridones was examined (Scheme 12).
At its most stereochemically simple level this reaction produces
two enantiomers, but the addition of a chiral R group to the
N-atom leads instead to two diastereomeric products. Two related
questions raised by such conversions are: (1) even though the
chirality of the R group is quite distant from the developing
stereocenters, can packing within the capsule formed by OA 2
promote high diastereoselective reaction? (2) How do other groups
around the pyridine ring influence reaction outcome?
The described research focused on the five pyridones 93–97.
NMR revealed that all formed 2 : 1 host–guest complexes in the
presence of excess OA 2, with the methyl group of 96 exhibiting
the largest shift from the free state indicating that it anchors
deeply into the polar region of one of the hemispheres of the
capsule. These studies also revealed that the molecules adopt a
pole-to-pole orientation with free rotation around the long
polar axis, but no flipping of the guest on this axis (Section
2.1.1.e). Presumably, in the dry environment of the capsule a
hydrogen bond can exist between the pyridine carbonyl and the
N–H of the chiral amide sidechain (Fig. 21). Photochemical
reaction of these pyridones in free acetonitrile solution resulted
in very low diastereoselectivity (diastereoselectivity ratio (dr) o
52 : 48), presumably because the chiral center in each example
cannot transmit its stereochemical information over the
relatively long distance between it and the developing stereo-
centers. On the other hand, within the capsule good to excellent
diastereoselectivity was observed, especially at 278 K. Thus dr
values ranged from B60 : 40 in the case of 93, to as high as 96: 4
in the case of 94; contrary to what was observed in solution, the
confining effect of the capsule did allow the stereochemical
information of the chiral center to be transmitted to the
developing centers.
A second paper detailing chiral photochemistry in the capsule
formed by OA 2 concerned the encapsulation of tropolone ethers
such as 98 and cyclohexadienones such as 99. The former
undergoes a 4e disrotatory cyclization to form [3.2.0]bicycles,
whilst the latter undergoes an oxa-di-p-methane rearrangement
to form [3.1.0]bicycles (Scheme 13). NMR analysis revealed that
both guests form 2 : 1 host–guest complexes with OA 2 dimer,

with their respective 7- and 6-member rings occupying one
hemisphere, and their chiral side chains occupying the other.
In free solution both molecules gave little or no diastereoselectivity
(dr B 50:50), but as anticipated, higher diastereoselectivity when
encapsulated within the host dimers. Thus tropolone ether 98
and cyclohexadienone 99 gave diastereomeric ratios of their
respective compounds of B68 : 32 (at 278 K).
It is not only stereochemical information within a molecule
that can be enhanced or biased within the confines of containers,
but conformation information too. Cyclohexylphenyl ketones
possess established conformational-dependent photochemistry
in solution, and were therefore prime targets to examine within
the nano-scape of the OA 2 dimer.70 Cyclohexylphenyl ketones
undergo Type I and Type II Norrish photochemistry (Scheme 14).
The Norrish type I reaction is independent of the conformational
preference of the cyclohexyl group, whereas the Norrish Type II
reaction that occurs in these compounds is dependent on the
position of the C-3 hydrogens in relation to the excited phenylacyl
carbonyl chromophore. Thus, only when the phenylacyl group is
axial are these hydrogens on the same side of the 6-membered
ring within reach of the carbonyl group. Two cyclohexylphenyl
ketones were examined: 100 (R = H in Scheme 14) and 100
(R = Me), both of which formed the expected 2 : 1 host–guest
complexes with OA 2. A comparison of the photochemistry
of these two ketones in free acetonitrile and encapsulated
within the capsule revealed that 100 (R = H) gave mostly
the Type II cyclobutanol product in free solution and only the
Type I products when encapsulated, whereas 100 (R = Me) gave

exclusively the cyclobutanol in free solution and the Type I
products when encapsulated. The initial conclusion of these
results could be that within the capsule the conformation
preference of the 6-membered ring is with an equatorial
phenylacyl group whose carbonyl cannot react with the C-3
hydrogens and so Type II chemistry is switched off. However,
1H DQF COSY NMR analysis revealed that in both free solution
and within the capsule it is the conformer with the axially
positioned phenacyl group that is preferred. Why no Type II
chemistry? Molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes
formed by 100 (R = H) and 100 (R = Me) reveal that although the
phenylacyl group is oriented axially, its carbonyl group is turned
away from the 6-membered ring. Thus, assuming a similar
packing of the excited state, the carbonyl group is seldom
in the position to react with the C-3 hydrogen atoms and form
Type II products (Fig. 22).
The behavior of carbenes generated within the OA 2 host has
recently been investigated (Scheme 15).71 A range of carbenes
generated from diazirines 101–104 were studied, with initial
investigations focused on the types of complex formed between
guests 101–104 and OA 2. From a combination of 1H and
diffusion NMR studies the authors concluded that 101 formed
a 2 : 2 host–guest complex, but that guests 102–104 formed
strong (ITC) 1 : 1 complexes.
In free solution, irradiation of 101–104 gave predominantly
ketone 106 and alcohol 107 in a combined yield of 490%. In
contrast, irradiation of the corresponding complexes generated
different products depending on the guest. In the case of 101,
the 2 : 2 complex led to an 89% yield of azine 105 (R = H). On the
other hand, the 1 : 1 complex of 102 in OA gave a 92% yield of
insertion products 108 and 109 (R = OH) and 8% 106 (R = OH),
while the host–guest complexes with 103 and 104 gave 55 and
63% of 106 (R = Cl and Br respectively), and a combined 45%
and 37% of the insertion products 108 and 109 (R = Cl and Br
respectively). The difference between the 1 : 1 complex of 102,
and the 1 : 1 complexes of 103 and 104 was rationalized with the
aid of molecular dynamics simulations. Thus, the preferred
orientation of 102 in the cavity of OA is with the diazirine group
pointing down into the base of the pocket of the host.
The corresponding carbene has little reaction options but to
therefore undergo insertion reactions. On the other hand, the
adamantanes 103 and 104 were predicted to bind with the
diazirine group pointing up. Such an orientation allows
the resulting carbene to readily react with water and generate
a significant amount of the ketone 106.
Whilst compartmentalization can radically alter photo-
chemistry it can also stop photophysical or photochemical
processes normally observed in solution. An excellent example
comes in the form of the entrapment of naphthalene 110,
anthracene 111, and tetracene 112 (Fig. 23) within the dimer
formed by OA 2.38 The smallest of these guests, naphthalene
110, shows only monomer emission in aqueous solution at
104 M, but at the same concentration in the presence of the
host shows a red-shifted monomer and an excimer emission.
NMR spectroscopy reveals why this is so: the guest forms a 2 : 2
complex with OA 2, and with two guests inside the capsule they
experience an eﬀective concentration of 3 M. Contrastingly, in
solution tetracene 112 normally undergoes facile photo-induced
dimerization and shows both monomer and excimer emission.
The capsular complex of this guest however only demonstrates
monomer emission and does not undergo guest dimerization

because the size and shape of the guest is such that only one
can fit within the capsule formed by OA 2. Between these two
examples is the interesting case of anthracene 111. Irradiation
of solutions of 111 normally leads to rapid and quantitative
formation of anthracene dimer, and as a result of the speed and
eﬃciency of this reaction only the weakest of excimer emissions
is normally observed along with monomer emission. NMR reveals
that this guest forms a 2:2 complex with OA 2, but rather than
promoting dimerization, none is observed. However, there is a
strong excimer emission band in the fluorescence spectrum of the
complex. Close scrutiny of the 1H NMR spectrum of the complex
solved this puzzle. The guests are held out of register with respect
to each other (Fig. 23), and in this relative position the two pairs
of 9,10 atoms cannot approach each other. As a result, extensive
irradiation leads to excimer emission but no dimerization.
As might be anticipated, this unusual situation has been shown
to be independent of the coating of the cavitand.22
The capsules formed by OA 2 also allow thioketones to
phosphoresce at room temperature.72 Phosphorescence of this
class of molecule is normally minimal at best because they
demonstrate strong diﬀusion limited self-quenching as well as
diﬀusion controlled oxygen quenching. Furthermore, singlet
oxygen generated by this process reacts with thioketones irre-
versibly. To examine the eﬀects of encapsulation on thioketones
three guests were chosen: camphorthione 113, fenchthione 114
(Fig. 24) and adamantanethione 49 (Fig. 15). Guests 113 and 49
are illustrative (Fig. 24, right).
1H, NOESY and diﬀusion NMR analysis revealed that these
two guests have subtly diﬀerent binding motifs within the
capsule. Thus camphorthione 113 binds preferentially with its
thioketone groups buried in the deep, ‘polar’ region of the nano-
space, whereas adamantanethione 49 binds in the opposite
manner with the two thioketone groups of the guests at the
equatorial region of the capsule (Fig. 24).
Guest 113 demonstrated phosphorescence at a capsule
concentration of 104 M, and possessed a relatively long lifetime
in the capsule (conc. 105 M), exceeding its lifetime at infinite
dilution in perfluorodimethylcyclohexane. Its enhanced fluores-
cence and lifetime suggests that no self-quenching of the guests
occurs, even though there are two per capsule with an eﬀective
molar concentration in the nano-space. This was attributed to
the preferred orientation of the guest within the capsule that
inhibits self-quenching and protects the guest from dissolved
oxygen. Indeed, when the rate constant for oxygen quenching
was measured it was found to be two orders of magnitude lower
than in common solvents. Considering the orientation of ada-
mantanethione 49 within the capsule it may be anticipated that
the complex demonstrates no phosphorescence. However, this is
not the case. Although weaker than the complex with 113, the
adamantanethione 49 possessed phosphorescence much greater
than that observed at infinite dilution. Interestingly the lifetime
of the phosphorescence from this complex was shorter than that
at infinite dilution. Apparently the two guests are oriented
relative to one another such that they can partially self-quench
and reduce their lifetimes, but cannot adopt the relative orienta-
tions attainable in free solution that bring about nearly complete
self-quenching. Overall, the ability of the capsule formed by OA 2
to enhance the phosphorescence of these guests (and in capsules
formed by related cavitands22) was found to be superior to that
of comparably sized, but more open, cucurbit[7]uril.
The photophysics and photochemistry discussed thus far
has assumed that the capsule formed by OA 2 is an inert
container akin to a nano-scale round-bottomed flask. However,
very recent results have demonstrated for the first time that this
is not actually the case.73 Thus in their excited state the capsules
formed by OA 2 and related cavitand 8 have been shown to be
good triplet energy donors to ground state guests, and in their
ground state have been shown to be electron donors to excited
state species. To investigate the possibility that these hosts can
act as triplet sensitizers guests such as 115 – that form distinct
products depending on the type of excitation – were included
inside the capsule (Scheme 16). Guest 115 formed a strong,
structurally well-defined 2 : 2 host–guest complex with OA 2,
and irradiation of this complex led smoothly to a quantitative
yield of the triplet product 116. Guest 115 did likewise with
the capsule formed by 8, but in this instance the transforma-
tion to 116 was considerably slower than with OA 2. With
either host there was no evidence of the singlet product 117.

Benzoate groups are known triplet sensitizers, and so these
results strongly support the notion that the benzoate groups of
the hosts are excited to the singlet state, undergo intersystem
crossing, and transfer their energy to the encapsulated guest; in
the case of OA 2, the more local benzoate groups at the rim of
the host are more efficient at transferring their energy than the
more distal benzoates in the pendant groups of 8.
The OA 2 capsule is also capable of donating electrons to
excited electron acceptors. To take one example, the fluorescence
of acridinium 118 was quenched upon the addition of OA 2, a
quenching that was shown to be static rather than dynamic,
with
a
sub-nanosecond
rate
constant.
Since
water-soluble
cationic guests are known to associate with the outside of the
host (Section 2.1.1.f), and considering the higher S1 energies of OA
2 versus 118, the observed fluorescence quenching was unlikely to
arise from singlet-singlet energy transfer. Considering the likely
oxidation potentials of OA 2 and 8, the authors attributed the loss
of fluorescence of excited guests such as 118 to electron transfer.
There are also rare examples of reactions occurring between
the OA 2 capsule and an encapsulated guest. In this regard it is
worth highlighting a paper that, although on the edge of the
purview of this review, is of significant note74 Specifically, it has
recently been noted that the 1 and 2-azidoadamantanes 119
and 120 (Fig. 25) bind to OA 2 to form the corresponding 1 : 1
complexes. Irradiation of these complexes results in the genera-
tion of the corresponding nitrene complexes, and this reactive
guest then inserts into one of the four benzal hydrogens of the
host to generate ‘cavitands’ such as 121 (Fig. 25).
And on the topic of photochemical insertion into the
capsule formed by OA 2 we turn to the last example on the
topic of photoreactions in these cavitand dimers, the release of
encapsulated guests via a photo-trigger mechanism.75 In this
work, a series of p-methoxyphenacyl esters 122 (R = various) were
encapsulated with the OA 2 dimer. In each case the corre-
sponding 2 : 1 host–guest complex was formed. 1H NMR analysis
demonstrated that irradiation of these complexes fragmented
the guest which in turn led to the breakdown of the supra-
molecular capsule. Each guest produced between three and five
products, primarily the p-methoxy acetophenone and the corre-
sponding carboxylic acid (Scheme 17), but also in some cases the
insertion product where the p-methoxy acetophenone moiety
inserted into a benzal C–H bond of the host (cf. 121). The wide
range of products observed suggested to the authors that more
than one mechanism for the decomposition of the guest might
be operational. Because the host is a good triplet sensitizer
(vide supra) it was suggested that the triplet excited state of the
bound guest was central to its decomposition. However, further
work is required to fully understand this system.

The eﬀect of sequestration is generally attributed to the control
of the overall shape of the 4-(p-hydroxybenzylidene)imidazoli-
din-5-one chromophore. Mimics of this chromophore, e.g. 123
(R1 and R2 = various) have been investigated to examine how
changes to the dihedral angle of the benzylidene single and
double bond influence their fluorescence properties. To gain
further insight, a group of researchers led by Tolbert examined
the encapsulation of 123 (R1 and R2 = various) by the OA 2 dimer
capsule.76 As anticipated, the para-alkyl derivatives exhibited
strong shielding of both the para-alkyl and N-alkyl group
signals, suggesting that groups in this position are anchored
at the polar region of the capsule. However, neither para- nor
meta-substituents were eﬃcient at ameliorating internal con-
version of the guest. In contrast, ortho-substituents led to a one
order of magnitude increase in the fluorescence quantum yield
relative to benzene solution.
All of the 2 : 1 complexes of the guests examined were biased
towards their trans-isomer, with photo-stationary states as high
as 94 : 6 for the trans to cis ratio. As has been discussed above,
this bias for alkene geometry reflects a more eﬃcient filling of
the cavity of the trans isomer. Interestingly, contrary to what
has been observed with stilbenes, the propensity for cis to trans
isomerization did not correlate with the internal conversion
eﬃciency. Thus, the presence of an ortho-substituent in 123
attenuated internal conversion without inhibiting isomerization.
The conclusion of the authors was therefore that within the capsule
formed by OA 2 the ortho-substituent prevents rotation around
the benzylidene single bond, decreasing internal conversion,
and allowing either fluorescence or double bond isomerization.
In contrast, in solution the combination of a double bond
isomerization with eﬃcient single bond rotation allows both
eﬃcient isomerization and eﬃcient internal conversion.
More recently, the range of chromophores encapsulated
within the confines of the OA 2 dimer was expanded consider-
ably.77 Specifically, the choice of R1 groups was expanded to
include a range of ortho-, meta-, and para-substituents covering
the gamut of common electron withdrawing and donating groups.
With the exception of cases where the guest had an ortho ethyl
group, all the chromophores formed the expected 2 :1 host–guest
complexes. In each case fluorescence quantum yields were
measured and fitted (linear regression analysis) to an equation
based on a linear free energy relationship involving a Hammett
substituent constant and a density functional theory derived
volume change from replacing an H-atom in the parent with the
substituent. An analysis of the resulting correlation factors from
the data obtained with the chromophores in free solution
revealed that electronic effects dominated the fluorescence of
the different molecules in the case of meta- or para-substituents,
but that steric factors as large as 12% were apparent with ortho-
substituents. On the other hand, the effect of R2 was negligible.
In addition, this analysis also revealed that there is substantial
negative charge transfer to the aryl ring in the transition state
for decay.
In contrast, a similar analysis for the data obtained from the
chromophores encapsulated within the OA 2 dimer revealed that
the remote R2 group did have a significant eﬀect, approaching
that of ortho-substituents, but that the eﬀect of R2 decreased in
the order: ortho 4 meta 4 para for the position of the R1 group.
Unusually, this analysis also revealed that as R1 was kept constant
and R2 increased in size there was a non-monotonic relationship
with quantum yield; the quantum yield increased for methyl
through propyl, and then decreased with larger R2 groups.
This was attributed to conformational locking of the guest
with increasing size, and then an over-crowding of the capsule.
Comparing the steric eﬀects of the ortho-, meta-, and para-
substituents, guest conformational locking was more apparent
with the ortho- and meta-substituents; the para-substituents
could not prevent aryl group rotation. Finally, a comparison
of the data from benzene with that of the encapsulated guest
demonstrated that internal conversion within the capsule must
require more charge transfer back to the ground state; an
observation that may reflect a larger amount of twist in the
guest when bound within the capsule.
(d) Cavitands and capsules on surfaces. A range of cavitands
has been investigated on solid surfaces. For example, with a
long-term goal of examining photochemistry on inert solid
supports, the photophysical properties of complexes formed
by OA 2, and cavitands 7 and 8 have been studied on silica
surfaces.22 Whereas the fluorescence of 30 (Fig. 9) and phos-
phorescence of 113 (Fig. 24) are weak at best when adhered to
silica, the corresponding adhered cavitand complexes both
showed
strong
phosphorescence,
suggesting
that
they
remained intact upon binding to the silica. Similarly, when
adsorbed onto silica the capsular complex of anthracene 111
(Fig. 23) showed strong excimer emission consistent with the
stable 2 : 2 capsular complex observed in solution.78 Perhaps
the strongest evidence for successful capsule formation on
silica came from guest 64 (Scheme 5). As has been discussed,
in solution irradiation of the OA 2 complex with 64 produces a
high yield of rearranged product 68, and likewise complexes of
this guest with OA 2, 7 and 8 absorbed onto silica gave
comparable yields of this benzyl phenyl ketone.
The unusual optical and electronic properties of gold nano-
particles have led to much interest in their potential biomedical
and opto-electronic applications. With this in mind, the Rama-
murthy group has synthesized a number of amine-coated and
thiol-footed cavitands for functionalizing gold nano-particles.79
Nano-particles coated with the former did not behave well and
will therefore not be discussed here, but within this thiol-group
several cavitands were studied in aqueous solution. Hosts 124
and 125 are representative examples.
Gold particles were synthesized with 124 on their surface and
characterized with a combination of Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM), UV-vis absorption, IR, 1H NMR, Dynamic
Light Scattering (DLS), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA).

All of these techniques indicated successful inclusion of the
cavitands onto the gold surface. Regarding host–guest complexa-
tion, although hampered by the expected signal broadening NMR
studies confirmed that guests could form 1:1 host–guest com-
plexes with the bound cavitands. Furthermore, with guests such as
30 (Fig. 9) NMR suggested that capsular complexes were formed on
the surface of the gold. Taking this one step further, a mixture of
gold nano-particles coated with 124, guest 30, and excess cavitand
125 in free solution, suggested a degree of hetero-capsule
formation on the surface of the nano-particle. Apparently, the
hydrophobic effect is in operation at the surface of these gold
nano-particles and that capsular complexes similar to the ones
constituting the bulk of this review can be formed.
2.2
Velcrands
Velcrands are resorcinarene-based cavitands that, because of
the two-atom bridging between pairs of opposing resorcinarene
oxygen atoms, can exist as either in a ‘flat’ (C2v) kite form, or a
deeper concave (C4v) vase form (Scheme 18). The rather flat
nature of the kite form means that it readily undergoes self-
assembly to form the corresponding dimer devoid of binding
properties. On the other hand, the vase form has a rich record
of host–guest chemistry that goes back some three decades.80
One prominent thrust of the Rebek group has been the devel-
opment of novel water-soluble velcrands. The majority of this
work has focused on solution studies, but as we discuss below
some amphiphilic velcrands have also been studied having been
imbedded into micelles or membranes. We highlight these
studies where they are carried out in conjunction with solution
work. Readers should note in passing though that papers
describing micelles composed of amphiphilic velcrands,81 and
papers centered solely on micelle bound velcrands82 have also
appeared in the literature.
An early example of a water-soluble velcrand 126 (Scheme 19)
was synthesized in three steps from the octa-nitro derivative 127;
itself available from bridging the corresponding resorcinarene
128 with 1,2-difluoro-4,5-dinitrobenzene.83
The carboxylate appended host 126 was shown to exist only
in the vase form under aqueous conditions, in large part because
water molecules can bridge the benzimidazole groups and help
seam the host together. In addition though, the ‘free’ host was
found to contain a single adventitious molecule of THF bound to
the cavity that resisted removal even by heating to 100 1C under
high vacuum. This uninvited guest was however displaced in the
presence of suitable alternative guests.
In passing it is worth noting that in further work,84 it
was shown that when the solvent in the final step for the
preparation of 126 (Scheme 19) was switched from THF/H2O
to EtOH/H2O, the THF-free host could be isolated. However, 1H
and DOSY NMR, as well as electrospray MS demonstrated
that this ‘free’ host existed in the aqueous and gas phase as
the kite-form dimer. The dimer was however quite weak; one
equivalent of THF was suﬃcient to form the monomeric
vase form. Consequently, all studies on 126 focused on the
THF-containing monomeric host.
Tetraalkylammonium ions as large as tetraethylammonium
were found to bind to host 126, but larger guests such
as tetrapropylammonium did not. To take one successful
example, tetramethylammonium bound with an association
constant of Ka = 3800 M1. Binding of these guests was slow
on the 1H NMR timescale, and 2D NOESY experiments revealed
that the egression rate of bound tetramethylammonium was
8.2 s1. This corresponds to a relatively high energy-barrier
of 16 kcal mol1. Binding was not just a question of size,
shape and charge complementarity. For example, primary and
secondary ammoniums of similar size to the aforementioned

tetraalkylammoniums were rejected by the host, presumably
because they have much stronger hydration shells. However,
larger ammoniums that could simultaneously present a relatively
hydrophobic moiety for binding to the pocket and an ammonium
group for the rim carboxylates, were found to bind strongly.
Examples include S-nicotinium 129 and rimantadium 130
(Fig. 26). Acetylcholine 131 and choline 132 were also found to
bind strongly to the host (Ka = 14600 and 25900 M1 respectively),
but the related L-carnitine 133 was found to only weakly bind
(Ka = 150 M1). This was attributed to the fact that the carboxylate
of the guest is in close proximity to the negatively charged upper
rim of the host. Although ITC data suggested that Coulombic
forces were important in these complexations, the hydrophobic
eﬀect also plays a role. Thus, host 126 could readily extract
adamantane 134 from the solid state into a D2O solution.
Preliminary investigations of the eﬀects of buﬀer and salts
(the Hofmeister eﬀect) on the solubility of host 126 revealed
complex and poorly understood physicochemical properties.
Trembleau and Rebek also used host 126 to demonstrate the
first helical motif of an encapsulated guest.43a A 2 mM solution
of 126 and dodecyl phosphocholine (DPC, 135, Fig. 27) resulted
in an 1H NMR spectra showing individual signals for each
methylene unit of the hydrocarbon chain and the terminal
methyl, with upfield shifts for the proton signals of eight carbons
as high as Dd = 5 ppm. However, the internal environment of 126
can only accommodate at most six carbons in an extended
motif. As the 2 mM concentration of DPC is above its critical
micelle concentration (CMC) of 1 mM, analogous experiments
were conducted with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 136, Fig. 27)
below its B8 mM CMC. These produced similar results, with far
upfield shifted signals for the methylene units and terminal
methyl group. A comparison of the NMR of free and bound 135
and 136 revealed little diﬀerence between the guests indicating
they bind in a similar fashion.
This data can only be readily explained by assuming
the alkyl chain coils up inside the pocket of the host. This
preference for the coiled motif was attributed by the authors to
the release of ‘‘ordered’’ water molecules from the surface of
the hydrocarbon chain and from the interior of the cavity.
Additionally, in the coiled form more C–H bonds of the guest
can form attractive interactions with the aromatic p-surfaces of
the benzene moieties that line the cavity. Finally, the authors
noted size complementarity exists between the dodecyl chain
(126 Å3) and the inside of the cavity (225 Å3), a close to ideal
packing coefficient of 0.56. These factors combine to overcome

the roughly 2.5–3.0 kcal mol1 of straining gauche interactions
that this conformation imposes on the coiled chain.
Further examination of the NMR spectra of these complexes
reveals slightly broadened bound guest peaks in the upfield region.
Since the exchange process must overcome a 15–20 kcal mol1
barrier afforded by the breaking and refolding of the seam of
hydrogen (deuterium) bonds that enforces the vase form of
the receptor, and as the helical guest motif within the cavity
should produce diastereomeric complexes, the broadening of
the proton signals was attributed to time-averaging of the
signals from multiple conformations.
In related work the same group looked at the interaction
between SDS 136 and water soluble cavitand 126 as a function
of increasing amounts of surfactant.85 As just discussed, with
one equivalent of 136 the guest forms a kinetically stable
complex with host 126. However, in the presence of a slight
excess of guest (ca. 1.3 equiv.) the exchange rate becomes rapid
relative to the NMR timescale and the upfield resonances
diminish as the chemical shifts relating to the free and bound
species average. With a concentration of 10 mM 136, i.e., above
the CMC, the host NMR signals broaden somewhat, whilst at
very high concentrations of 136 (20–40 mM) a new set of broad
signals appeared. Considering the amphiphilic nature of the
host, the authors hypothesized that the host was being
included into micelles, and to test this diffusion (DOSY) NMR
measurements were performed. The first of these indicated that
host 126 was monomeric between 0.2 mM–4 mM, and in the
presence of one equivalent of 136 a similarly sized 1 : 1 complex
was observed. Further DOSY measurements on 136 alone
indicated a decreasing diffusion coefficient with increasing
concentration; below 3.7 mM (D = 4.2  106 cm2 s1) the
surfactant was essentially monomeric, whilst above the CMC
there existed an equilibrium between micelle and monomer.
Finally, at 40 mM SDS (D = 1.3  106 cm2 s1) the apparent
hydrodynamic radius of the micelle was calculated to be 15.4 Å.
For the mixture of 40 mM surfactant and 1 mM 126 the
diffusion coefficient of the latter was noted to have decreased
to just 0.8  106 cm2 s1; a corresponding hydrodynamic
radius of approximately 25 Å. These data indicate each cavitand
is associated within a micelle composed of approximately
60 amphiphiles. Incorporated into the surfactant micelle, there
was no evidence of lipid tail binding into the pocket of the host.
Furthermore, the host retained the ability to bind guests from
the exterior aqueous solution. For example, acetylcholine bound
with an affinity of Ka E 1.7  104.
The Rebek group have also reported on a comprehensive
analysis of the binding of acyclic and cyclic hydrocarbons to
host 126.84,86 As just discussed, in the case of DPC 135 and SDS
136 the guest adopts a helical packing motif to maximize the
number of methylene groups shielded from the outer aqueous
environment. For small n-alkanes, NMR illustrated well that
they do not bind in quite the same way. For the smallest guests
(C3–C5) peaks are broad, presumably because of relatively fast
exchange. However, even the larger guests (C6–C12) gave broad
and/or clustered peaks on the NMR spectra indicative of coiled
motifs that were rapidly tumbling within the cavity. In addition,
with guest lengths too long to be accommodated within the
cavity (C9 or larger) binding was quite weak and competing THF
binding prevented full complexation. Branched alkanes also bound,
but with slower tumbling and broad ill-defined NMR signals.
Entropic costs with confinement were smaller for cyclic
guests, and these proved to be generally stronger guests than
the acyclic counterparts. Overall competitive binding studies
revealed that cyclohexane was the best guest.
Small aromatic guests on the other hand are rigid and there-
fore cannot adopt diﬀering conformations to optimally fill the
cavity space. Consequently, these showed only weak aﬃnity to the
cavity. Larger aromatic guests did however bind. 4,40-Dimethylbi-
phenyl 137 (Fig. 28) was the longest guest bound, and anthracene
(111), stilbene 50 (R = H), and 1,4-di-tert-butylbenzene 138 also
bound eﬃciently.
The insolubility of these aliphatic and aromatic alkanes in
water precluded quantification of the thermodynamics for
binding. Consequently, a series of neutral, amphiphilic guests
were also chosen as guests to study by ITC. Guests included a
number of cyclic and adamantyl alcohols and ketones which all
bound with the neutral hydrophobic moiety inside the cavity
and the polar head group at the cavity rim. Binding constants
were typically 4105 M1. Complexation of these guests was noted
to be strongly entropically driven with only a small contribution
made by enthalpy. This latter point was attributed to the absence
of cation–p interactions. As expected for complexations driven
by the hydrophobic effect, complexation was associated with a
negative heat capacity change

Two dimensional EXSY NMR experiments were used to
determine the exchange rates of the various guests. For the
diﬀerent guests examined egression rates varied from 1.7 to
14.6 s1, which correspond to free energies of activation DG‡
from 17.2 to 16.0 kcal mol1. The similarity of these values,
coupled with the concentration independence of the guest
exchange rates, suggests that host 126 must fully unfold for a
guest to vacate the cavity.
Velcrand 126 has been shown to act as a phase-transfer
catalysts for transporting hydrophobic species into aqueous
solution to bring about their reaction.87 The reaction in question
was between organic-phase maleimides (139) and a water-soluble
thiol (Scheme 20).

Host 126 readily transferred a number of N-substituted
maleimides by complexation to the R group of the substrate,
whereupon the resulting complex rapidly reacted with the thiol.
Owing to the charge on each product, the resulting products
were poorer guests than their corresponding starting materials.
Hence product inhibition was avoided and eﬃcient catalysis
seen at levels as low as 0.5 mol%. Variations on the nature
of the R group in 139 highlighted several important factors
necessary for eﬃcient and rapid transfer and reaction. First, if
the starting material was a poor guest and poorly soluble in
water then it would undergo only very slow reaction. Second, if
139 was partially soluble in water then although the presence of
126 accelerated the reaction, the fast background rate meant
low relative rate acceleration. Third, the rate of the overall
process was determined by the transfer rates of the maleimide
into the aqueous layer, and this in turn was linked to the
binding aﬃnity of the R group. Good complementarity led to
high relative rates (assuming 139 was insoluble in water).
Finally, with selected pairs of maleimides significant reaction
selectivities could be achieved.
Kaifer and Rebek have studied the electrochemistry of
ferrocene derivatives bound to the hydrophobic pocket of
cavitand 126.88 This work showed that a 1.0 mM solution
of 126 increased the solubility of ferrocene 53 (Fig. 16) from
50 mM in 0.1 M NaCl to fully soluble at like salt concentrations.
As expected, NMR analysis of the mixture indicated guest
inclusion within the hydrophobic pocket; an association con-
stant of B9  104 M1 was estimated based on the fact that
with a 1:1 stoichiometry of host and guest there was no free guest
observed by NMR, and the assumption this corresponded to at
least 90% guest complexation. Similar studies with partially water-
soluble guests 55 (Fig. 16) and ferrocenemethanol 140 allowed
association constants to be accurately determined. Thus, 55
bound with an aﬃnity of Ka = 1300 M1, whilst 140 had an
association constant of Ka = 4800 M1. In all cases NMR demon-
strated slow exchanging systems with the expected insertion of
the ferrocene moiety into the hydrophobic cavity, and where
present, the polar group exposed to the exterior environment.
The included guests were also investigated using cyclic
voltammetry (CV). Of particular note is that in the presence of
equimolar amounts of host 126, the voltammogram was essen-
tially flat with no observed faradaic response. In the case of
excess guest 55 and 140 (53 did not possess suﬃcient solubility)
a cyclic voltammetric response was observed. Complete encap-
sulation of these guests within the dimer formed by OA 2
(Section 2.1.1.f) was previously noted to completely switch oﬀ
their electrochemistry,53 but this was not anticipated in the
open 1 : 1 complex with 126. Precisely why 126 has such an
eﬀect on these guests is yet to be determined.
Host 141 (Fig. 29) is an interesting variation on 126. The aryl
groups of tetra-acid 141 eﬀectively act as revolving doors to the
cavity and modulate both the thermodynamics and kinetics of
guest binding.89 For example, the presence of the doors means that
141 has a preference for cyclopentane over cyclohexane. For 126 the
reverse was true. Correspondingly, in a competition study between
these two hosts, 141 preferentially bound cyclopentane (7.5:1), but
in a similar study with cyclohexane 126 outcompeted 141 by two to
one. Additionally, the residency time of guests within host 141 are
much longer than for host 126. Thus, EXSY NMR revealed that for
cyclohexane as guest entry and egression rates are approximately
two orders of magnitude slower in the case of 141.
We close on the topic of ethyl-footed velcrands with a passing
note concerning tetra-ammonium cavitand 142 (Fig. 29).90 The
bromide salt of this cavitand had good solubility in water, and
existed solely in the kite form in aqueous solution. In contrast to
126 however, the addition of THF did not trigger the formation
of the vase form. In fact, formation of the vase form required
substantial amounts of a water-miscible co-solvent. Consequently,
its hosting properties could not be investigated in water but in
3 : 1 D2O : DMSO solutions instead.
An alternative family of water-soluble velcrands is shown in
Scheme 21. The formation of carbohydrate-conjugated cavitand
143 utilized tetrahydroxy resorcinarene 3,91 and was based on
earlier related examples of water-soluble velcrands.92 The tetrakis
(b-D-glucosyl) moieties of 143 was added by a late-stage azide–
alkyne ‘‘click’’ reaction between a lower-rim functionalized tetra-
zido cavitand and a propargyl glycoside. As with other hosts of
this type, the eight amide groups at the rim help to stabilize the
vase conformation. NMR evidence suggested that host 143 exists
in a kite-conformation in order to minimize solvent-exposed
hydrophobic surfaces. However, addition of guests induced vase
conformation with concomitant complexation.

including: cylcohexanesulfonate 144, (1R)-(—)-10-camphorsulfonic
acid 145, quinuclidine hydrochloride 146, and adamantylamine
hydrochloride 147 (Fig. 30). EXSY NMR experiments revealed
for 146 a guest dissociation barrier of 13.6 kcal mol1 at 37 1C.
However, under strongly basic conditions the neutral form of this
guest did not bind. Similar studies have also been performed for
a velcrand with tetraethylene glycol pendant groups possessing
pH-independent water solubility.93
When exposed to SDS micelles host 143 was successfully
incorporated (DOSY NMR). Within the micelle the host adopted
the vase form and could bind small molecules such as 146.
Other molecules that did not bind to the host in free solution
were also bound by 143 when it itself was within the micelle,
the interpretation being that the absence of any dimeric kite
form in the micelle enhanced the binding properties of the
host. Guest 146 also dissociated more slowly from the micelle-
associated caviplex, with a barrier of 14.4 kcal mol1 at 37 1C.
Interestingly, the binding properties of 143 remained even after
dissolution in human serum. Furthermore, in a subsequent report
it was noted that this host could bind and detect guests 146 and
147 (a FDA approved drug for influenza and Parkinson’s disease)
in spiked samples of human urine.94 In lyophilized human urine
reconstituted with deuterium oxide, 143 existed as a soluble
dimer velcrand, i.e., no endogenous constituents of human urine
can occupy the binding site of the host and enforce the vase
form. Unfortunately, the detection limit for this technique was in
the millimolar range and therefore of limited application.
The Rebek group also showed the ability of a guanidinium-footed
cavitand 148 to incorporate in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC, 135)
micelles.95 The host was prepared in one step from tetra-amine 149
(Scheme 22), itself available in ten steps from commercially available
materials.92b Cavitand 148 was soluble up to 2.0 mM in D2O and
adopted the characteristic non-binding kite form. In contrast, the
vase form was only observed in solutions of acetone.

In aqueous solution, 148 modestly bound a variety of cationic
and neutral guests, in each case with the nonpolar group of the
guest buried deep within the pocket. One possibility for the
relatively weak binding was the lack of any unoccupied vase form
of 148. Thus, for a guest to bind to the host it must first
overcome the dimerization of the kite form of the host. Although
functioning as a cation and neutral guest binder, the addition of
anionic species induced precipitation of the host.
When 148 was included in a solution containing dodecyl-
phosphocholine (DPC, 135) micelles (20 mM), the NMR spectrum
showed signals characteristic of the vase form and an additional
upfield signal at 0.4 ppm. ROESY NMR studies showed reso-
nance between this peak and the trimethylammonium group of
135 and not the nonpolar tail group, suggesting that the host was
located near the surface of the micelle. Approximately 25% of
the host was occupied by lipid. Experiments below the critical
micelle concentration of 135 showed no appreciable binding
between 148 and either terminal of the phospholipid, suggesting
that preorganization of the vase form by the micelle enhances the
binding ability of 148. As such, 148 serves as both a guest to the
micelle and host to the lipid head-group.
Molecular dynamics simulations on the incorporation of 148
into a 65-molecule DPC micelle were then carried out. The simula-
tion began with 148 at the interface, but over time it submerged
itself into the micelle to the point that its hydrophobic portions
were surrounded by alkyl chains of 135 whilst its open-end
remained accessible to bulk solvent. Subsequent to this, as
observed by NMR, an ammonium group from the phospholipid
bound into the pocket of the cavitand.
Binding studies using the micelle-incorporated host demon-
strated that all of the guests tested in aqueous solution still
bound to 148. In addition, guest binding was much stronger,
with as much as a 230-fold increase in Ka. Van’t Hoﬀplots for
the case of 146 binding to the cavitand, in both free solution
and within the micelle, revealed a favorable enthalpy of binding
in both cases (DH = 3.0 and 8.1 kcal mol1 respectively). The
diﬀerence between the DH for complexation in water versus the
micelle was tentatively attributed to the greater preorganization
of the host in the latter. These studies also revealed a small
entropic penalty of DS = 8.4 and 9.7 cal K1 mol1 in water
and DPC micelles respectively. Interestingly, other related
cavitands usually give strongly positive DS values in water.
Because the NMR spectra of 148 showed very well resolved signals,
this diﬀerence was tentatively attributed to a lack of aggregation of
host 143. The more negative entropy of formation in the presence
of the micelle is, as the authors noted, consistent with the
reduction of the degrees of freedom of the micelle-bound complex.
A variation on velcrand 149 is the chiral derivative 150.96
This host possesses a unique benzimidazole bridge with an
appended carboxylic acid group that dangles into its binding
pocket. Consequently it can form a hydrogen bond/salt bridge
with amine guests that bind to the pocket. In the absence of a
suitable guest 150 adopts a kite form, but the addition of a
suitable binder such as quinuclidine hydrochloride 146 results
in the vase form. The association constant of this guest is over
two orders of magnitude larger than that between 146 and 149.
This corresponds to an enhancement of 2.7 kcal mol1, a
stabilization attributed in large part to the buried hydrogen
bond between host and guest. A more rigorous determination
using a free-energy cycle gave a value of this hydrogen bond of
3.0 kcal mol1. EXSY NMR studies suggested that the intro-
verted carboxylic acid also aﬀected the rate of guest exchange.
An energy barrier for guest egression from 150 was measure at
19 kcal mol1 in the case of guest 146, a full 2 kcal mol1 more
than for host 149. Regardless, this relatively high barrier strongly
supports the common guest exchange mechanism seen with
these type of velcrands: such a mechanism requires a change
from the vase to kite form costs (ca. 10–12 kcal mol1), plus the
rupture of the seam of hydrogen bonds (5–7 kcal mol1).
The Hooley, Cheng, and Rebek groups have examined the
immobilization of cavitands on gold substrates for protein
recognition.97 This study centered round cavitand 151, which by
virtue of its thioether-functionalized feet could be readily appended
onto gold surfaces. A combination of Surface Plasmon Resonance
(SPR) and Surface Plasmon Resonance Imaging (SPRi) was used
to study the binding properties of this host.
The host was first deposited as a self-assembled monolayer
(SAM) onto a cleaned gold electrode by immersing the electrode in
a 0.5 mM solution of 151 in n-butanol containing a 10:1 ratio of
151 and either N-octadecanethiol (ODT) or 11-mercaptoundecanoic

acid (MUA). The ODT or MUA were needed as fillers to enhance
the predominance of the vase form of 151 and completely
inhibit CV current; the SAM of 151 alone incompletely
filled the gold chip and resulted in limited insulation of the
electrode surface.
Focusing first on the NMe3
+-tagged fluorescein guest 152
(Fig. 31), it was noted that the strongest SPR response was for
the SAM composed of 151 alone, but that suﬃcient although
more modest signal could be obtained with the mixed SAM
composed of 151 and ODT. Unfortunately, tests revealed that
the SAM composed of just ODT also had a strong response
to 152. Consequently, attention turned to the MUA filler, and as
expected, monolayers of MUA alone showed no aﬃnity for 152
whereas the mixed monolayer with 151 and MAU did.
A number of additional ammonium guests were bound to
the immobilized 151, and although changes in resonance angle
upon binding were modest, they were significant. To take this one
step further, the authors then turned to guest binding detection
using SPRi, which, because of its micro-array compatibility makes
the approach amenable to large-scale screening of targets in the
fields of drug discovery. Briefly, a similar sample preparation led
to successful surface deposition in defined arrays, and these could
be used in label-free guest binding determinations.
Finally, the group turned to protein recognition by SPR. For
this they first demonstrated that the mixed monolayer with 151
and MAU successfully bound biotin derivative 153. Subsequent
addition of a solution of streptavidin induced an increase
in resonance angle indicative of immobilization of the strepta-
vidin at the surface. Cross-checks demonstrate that 153 was
essential for streptavidin recognition, and that no signal was
observed in the absence of the cavitand. In combination these
experiments proved that neither the guest nor the protein can
be immobilized by MUA alone, and biosensing required the
complete set of specific non-covalent interactions involving the
cavitand, the biotin guest 153, and streptavidin.
Most recently the Rebek group have utilized velcrands to form
capsules that form in water. As we will see, whilst hydrogen bonding
is important in their formation, the hydrophobic eﬀect also plays a
key role in their formation. This program is based on velcrand 154, a
host that is based on an early example of a velcrand capsule devised
by De Mendoza.98 The dimeric capsule of 154 is held together by
sixteen hydrogen bonds between the hydrogen bond acceptors and
donor groups of the benzimidazolone rim, whilst its water-solubility
arises from the eight pyridinium pendant groups.
Host 154 is synthesized in eight steps and exists in both the
kite and vase forms at low concentrations. The first guests
reported that confirmed capsule formation were n-undecane
through n-tetradecane (C11–C14). NMR demonstrated that the
guest n-undecane fits comfortably in an extended conforma-
tion, while the longer alkanes adopt gauche conformations
within the capsule. Absolute binding affinities could not be
determined because of the very low water solubility of these
guests, but competitive studies revealed a relative order for
binding affinity to be: C11 4 C12 4 C13 4 C14.
A series of rigid molecules with subtly diﬀering lengths,
including stilbene 50 (Fig. 15) and viologen 54 (R = Me, Fig. 16),
were used to probe both the length of the inner-space and the
guest preferences of the 154 dimer. The initially report data
suggested that uncharged guests bound more strongly that
isosteric pyridinium salts.
The photophysical behavior of encapsulated stilbene derivative
50 also provided indirect evidence of the robustness of the seam
of hydrogen bonds at the capsule equator. The fluorescence of
50 was strong in mesitylene but completely quenched upon
encapsulation within the dimer formed by 154. This supports
the idea that the capsule must be quite robust in shape, for if it
were dynamic or ill-defined the host could adapt to accommodate

a planar stilbene guest and allow fluorescence. In reality, the
seam of hydrogen bonds stoutly defines the shape of the inner-
space such that the rings of a stilbene guest cannot be coplanar
while inside and its fluorescence is quenched.
In a follow-up communication, the short n-alkanes (C7 through
C11), and the appetite stimulant peptide ghrelin were respectively
encapsulated and complexed by 154.99 The smallest guest
n-alkanes heptane, octane, and nonane all formed the corre-
sponding 1 : 1 complex with the host. These rotated rapidly in
the internal hydrophobic environment created by the mono-
meric host and their corresponding 1H NMR signals were broad
and the spectra highly symmetrized. Interestingly, n-decane
formed both a 1 : 1 and a 2 : 1 complex with the host. Tell-tail
characteristics of the two complexes were: in the 1 : 1 complex
the guest exhibited 1H NMR signals over a narrow range indica-
tive of gauche interactions and an overall compressed guest
motif; in the 2 : 1 complex the same signals for the bound guest
were spread out over a wide ppm range indicating an extended
motif in a symmetrical environment. It was noted that the ratio
of the two complexes was temperature dependent, with the
capsular assembly predominating at elevated temperatures and
exclusively so above 340 K.
Exposure to amphiphiles such as octanoic acid also resulted
in a 1 : 1 complex, with as anticipated, the alkane chain
imbedded in the host cavity. Similarly the peptide ghrelin – a
28 amino-acid peptide that contains an octanoyl ester moiety at
the third (serine) residue – was also bound in a 1 : 1 manner.
Similar results were obtained for rat ghrelin, a truncated 10 amino
acid peptide. The binding constant of both ghrelin and rat-ghrelin
were too large to determine by NMR, but ITC titrations with rat-
ghrelin showed Ka = 2.5  105 M1, and both favorable enthalpy
and entropy of binding.
Per-methylation of the benzamidazolones groups of host 154
leads to 155, a velcrand which exhibited water solubility up to
10 mM in the kite form. Host 155 was expected to have more
flexible walls because whereas the vase form of 154 is stitched
together by hydrogen bonds to ‘‘bridging’’ water molecules, this
is not possible with 155. Correspondingly, the vase form of 155
could potentially hold wide guests (or wider guest motifs).
It transpires that this is indeed the case.
Brief sonication and/or heating with a series of n-alkanes
(C6 to C14) gave characteristic spectra associated with the vase
form, but with noticeably compressed signal ranges for the
bound-guest. Hence for the smallest guests this range spanned
only about 0.6 ppm, whilst for C13 and C14 this range was still a
relatively modest 2 ppm. As expected, for the short n-alkanes
(C6 to C10) the furthest upfield shifted signals were those of the
terminal methyl protons; time-averaged as they tumbled quickly
on the NMR time-scale with the one end pointed to the solvent
exterior and the other nestled deep within the pocket.
In contrast were the longer alkanes (C12 to C14) whose
terminal methyls were unexpectedly furthest downfield on the
1H NMR. Typically terminal methyl groups reside the deepest
within the cavitand pocket and as such are shielded the most by
the aromatic walls of the host. Hence they have the largest Dd
values with upfield shifts of 4.0 ppm or more. However, in the
case of these guests within 155 it was the central methylene
protons that possessed the largest upfield shift, demonstrating
that the mid-section of these guests is closest to the base of the
pocket. Correspondingly, the terminal methyl group signals
were the furthest downfield shifted of the bound guest region in
the NMR. In combination, this data indicates that the n-alkanes
C12–C14 adopt U-shaped motifs within the binding pocket of 155.
Because of the small range of signals in the NMR spectra, these
guests likely ‘‘writhe’’ in the defined space and adopt many low
energy variations on the idealized U-shaped motif.
To probe this type of binding further the authors turned to a
series of n-alcohols. NMR investigations confirmed that the
terminal methyls reside deep within the cavity for n-octanol and
n-nonanol (3.4 ppm, Dd = 4.2 ppm), but as the carbon chain
length increases the terminal methyl becomes less and less
shielded. With n-decyl (C10) and n-undecyl alcohols (C11) the
methyl signals are still the furthest upfield but have shifted
significantly downfield to 3.1 ppm and 2.6 ppm, respectively,
indicating the methyl is in the wider more capacious interior of
the cavity. The guest adopts a J-shaped motif. For the longest
homologue, tetradecanol (C14), the bound methyl signal appeared
at only 0.3 ppm, suggesting that this longer guest adopts a
U-shaped motif. Supporting this
1H NMR information, COSY
NMR indicated the carbon chains adopt helical and/or folded
conformations within the cavity as the terminal methyl is pushed
further and further out of the base of the pocket. Among other
groups tested, a, o diols also exhibited similar folding patterns.
2.3
Amphiphilic cogs
The Shionoya group has developed two water-soluble self-assemblies
driven by the hydrophobic eﬀect. The requisite amphiphiles were
based on pyridine containing tris-monodentate ligands 156 (Fig. 32),
which had previously been shown to self-assemble in organic media
to form either cages and capsules depending on the stoichio-
metry of Hg2+ and whether or not a cryptand was also present.100
The cages (Hg61564) required no templating guest, whilst the

fluorescently active capsules (Hg61568) were templated by an
encapsulated cryptand guest.
As a stepping-stone to working in pure water, the amphi-
phile 156 was shown to self-assemble in aqueous methanol to
form box-shaped hexamers (1566).101 Suggestive of the impor-
tance of the hydrophobic eﬀect in this assembly, water was
required to form the hexamer; the subunit was monomeric in
pure methanol. Optimal assembly required the encapsulation
of two templating molecules and with tribromomesitylene 160
(Fig. 33) as guest a crystal structure of the assembly was obtained.
As is so often the case with templated assemblies, the nature of
the template had a large influence on the success of assembly.
Thus, hexamethylbenzene 161 and mesitylene 162 were shown
by NMR to be good templates for this process, whereas 1,3-5-
trichlorobenzene 163 proved too small and hexabromobenzene
164 too big to template assembly.
Furthermore, in a subsequent publication it was revealed
that when adamantane 134 was used as a template, the product
formed was a tetrameric assembly 1564 with the template
encapsulated within.102 X-ray crystallography, NMR and MS were
all used to characterize the assembly. Similar self-assembled
inclusion complexes were also formed upon addition of pseudo-
spherical species such as Me4Si or CBr4, to a solution of 156.
Methylation of 156 gave the N-methylpyridinium amphi-
philes 157–159,103 of which 157 was insoluble in pure water
whereas 158 and 159 were fully water-soluble. NMR and X-ray
crystallography demonstrated that cog 158 had the predisposi-
tion to self-assembled into box-shaped hexamer 1586, and when
a suitable guest molecule such as 160 was present the assembly
encapsulated the guest to form the corresponding complex.
The 1H NMR spectrum of 158 in deuterated methanol was
remarkably simple showing monomeric 158 with C2v symmetry,
whereas the spectrum in D2O indicated several upfield shifted
proton signals indicating an aggregate. Examination of the
non-equivalent N-methyl and p-tolyl signals indicated a highly
symmetric box-shaped container was exclusively formed. The
formation of the hexameric aggregate was confirmed by PGSE
NMR measurement (log D = 9.9; D = 1.26  1010 m2 s1)
consistent with a 2 nm box. X-ray crystallography revealed that
the stability of the assembly was in part due to interactions
between electron-rich pyridyl groups sandwiched between pairs
of electron-deficient pyridiniums.
The box-shaped aggregate of 1586 was shown to be remark-
ably stable; heating to 353 K produced noticeably sharp NMR
spectra with no signs of dissociated monomer in solution. By
contrast, heating aggregate 1566 in CD3OD : D2O (3 : 1) aﬀorded
primarily the monomeric species at only 333 K. Additionally,
the critical concentration required for capsular assembly was
shown to be significantly lower than 1 mM: a 1 mM solution of
158 in MeOH showed characteristic UV absorption at 265 and
287 nm corresponding to the monomeric species, while an
increasing fraction of H2O caused a significant lessening of the
absorption bands; examination of the concentration eﬀect on
absorbance in pure H2O showed no hypochromism at all in the
concentration range from 1 mM to 100 mM.
The inner space formed by 1586 is 0.8 nm  0.8 nm and as
such can comfortably house two copies of the guest 160 in its
internal cavity; addition of water insoluble 160 to a D2O solution
containing 1586 resulted in rapid internalization of the guests
and downfield shifts of the 1H NMR signals of the methyl groups
from d = 2.64 ppm (in CD3OD) to d = 3.49 ppm in D2O.
In contrast to the properties of C2v symmetric 158, C3h
subunit 159 with three pyridinium groups formed a tetrameric
assembly around a templating adamantane 134 molecule. In
the absence of the template 159 actually forms a 1 : 9 ratio of the
tetramer and hexamer, but the addition of template 134 leads
to the quantitative formation of the tetramer.
3.0 Conclusions and outlook
This review has discussed three classes of molecules that have
been used by researchers to investigate self-assembly in aqueous
solution. The use of resorcinarene-based hosts dominates the area,
but all approaches demonstrate the importance of preorganization
of arrays of rigid (aromatic) moieties to define a specific form
predisposed to bind, fold, or assemble. Studying these molecules
and their properties is: (1) teaching us how to control supramole-
cular chemistry in water; (2) shedding light on some dark corners
of aqueous solutions chemistry, and; (3) illustrating novel applica-
tions that necessitate water being the solvent.
Regarding the first of these, supramolecular chemists are
familiar with the concept of a functional group driving and/or
directing binding or assembly. Thus the directionality of a
hydrogen bond – a notion derived from the variance on DH1
on the angle between donor and acceptor – may help drive a
molecule to form an assembly of specific form (constitution, and
relative position and orientation of subunits). The molecules
discussed in this review suggest modifications to this concept,
namely that: directionality can be free energy based rather than
enthalpically based, and that the definition of a ‘‘functional
group’’ can be expanded from a list useful to synthetic chemists,
to include moieties useful to supramolecular chemists. In all the
examples highlighted here, careful crafting of structure resulted
in functional groups (to use the just expanded definition) that
bind, fold, or assemble. . . in water.

The second and third points listed above are for the future;
but we are confident much can be learned from aqueous
supramolecular chemistry. Continued investigations involving
the aforementioned families of molecules, and potentially new
classes of molecules that are yet to be developed, will shed
more light on the mysteries of water and undoubtedly engender
new and useful applications. The details are certainly murky,
but the bigger picture seems quite clear.
