ABSTRACT: Synthetic receptors are powerful tools for molecular recognition. They can bind to guests with high selectivity and
affinity, and their structures are tunable and diversified. These features, plus the relatively low cost and high simplicity in synthesis
and modification, support the feasibility of array-based molecular analysis with synthetic receptors for improved selectivity in the
recognition of a wide range of targets. More attractively, host−guest interaction is reversible and guest displacement allows
biocompatible and gentle release of the host-bound molecules, simplifying the stimulation designs needed to control analyte sensing,
enrichment, and transportation. Here, we highlight a few recent advancements in using synthetic receptors for molecular analysis and
manipulation, with the focus on macrocyclic receptors and their applications in displacement sensing, separation, imaging, and drug
transport.
■INTRODUCTION
Small molecule synthetic receptors are a powerful alternative to
large biomolecules for target recognition in bioanalysis or as
targeting agents and drugs in medical applications. Whereas
large biomolecules such as antibodies are capable of very
strong and highly selective molecular recognition of bio-
logically important targets, their discovery and production are
often lengthy and labor-intensive, and as a result, they are
expensive and suffer from challenges in product character-
ization and quality control.1,2 In addition, antibodies are
specific, so one antibody only targets a single analyte, with
cross-reactivity often observed.3 Manipulations like immobili-
zation or modification of these large biomolecules may also
reduce target affinity and specificity.4 In contrast, small
molecule receptors can be chemically synthesized at relatively
low cost and with high scalability and can be easily derivatized
and tuned to recognize a diverse series of targets.5 They do,
however, show weaker affinity and selectivity than biomole-
cules, and so represent a complementary yet powerful
alternative to antibodies, protein receptors, and aptamers in
molecular recognition.
Synthetic receptors have been extensively employed in
molecular detection by coupling the noncovalent host−guest
interaction with a signal (often optical) output.6,7 To enhance
target selectivity and differentiation, multiple receptors can
form the so-called “chemical nose/tongue” sensor platform for
differential sensing,8−10 in which binding between multiple
individual receptors and each analyte results in a distinct
response profile. Subjecting the combined response profiles to
multivariate statistical tools such as principal component
analysis (PCA) allows selective discrimination of different
analytes.11 Many elegant arrays have been reported for
selective recognition of analytes with high structural similarity,
such as neurotransmitters,12 cannabinoids,13 and insect
pheromones,14 and have been applied for diagnostics and
drug discovery.15
Synthetic receptors have also been used to assist molecular
separation, an approach they are ideally suited to, due to their
small size, simplicity in surface immobilization, and reversible
target binding.16 In addition, selective and controlled guest

drug delivery and analyte enrichment.17−19
This topical review highlights recent advancements in
employing macrocyclic receptors for the analysis and
manipulation of biomolecules. As this is a concise review, the
discussion must be limited, and so we have focused on
molecular sensing via displacement assays and some new
developments in exploiting host−guest interactions for
separation, intracellular imaging, and drug transport, which
are the emerging topics in the field. Notably, we have chosen
to avoid applications involving cyclodextrins as receptors, as
these are myriad and have been covered extensively in recent
reviews.20−22
■SYNTHETIC RECEPTORS FOR SPECTROSCOPIC
SENSING OF BIOMOLECULES
The most common strategy employed when using synthetic
receptors in molecular sensing is the indicator (or
fluorescence) displacement assay (IDA/FDA).23−25 In these
assays, the analyte of interest displaces the guest from the host,
inducing an optical change. Many macrocyclic receptors have
been employed in FDA or IDA, including cucurbit[n]urils
(CB[n]), calix[n]arenes (CX[n]), pillar[n]arenes, cyclophanes,
and deep, water-soluble cavitands, etc.5 (Figure 1) These
receptors offer a hydrophobic pocket for recognition of
suitably sized targets, and the addition of charged or polar
groups on the macrocycle can confer water-solubility to
facilitate applications in aqueous environments. The binding
properties of these hosts are often driven by the hydrophobic
effect.26 Alternative mechanisms, such as CH−π, cation−π,
and electrostatic interaction, can also be exploited, allowing
detection of analytes that do not possess large hydrophobic
surfaces for binding.27,28
Selective recognition of structurally similar targets can be
challenging for simple receptors, but one of the most efficient
methods of maximizing selectivity is templated synthesis.29,30
This concept was recently employed by the Hof group to
create bivalent receptors for the recognition of neuromuscular
blocking agents (NMBAs). NMBAs have diverse biscationic
structures, but are a common geometrically defined pharma-
cophore consisting of two alkyl ammonium ions separated by
∼14 Å. Decamethonium, the paradigmatic NMBA, can bind to
two calixarene units, one at each NMe3
+ terminus. It was
therefore employed as the template to link two highly anionic
p-sulfonatocalixarene building blocks, which otherwise are
strongly repulsed from each other (Figure 2a).31 After
extraction of the decamethonium, the resultant bivalent
calixarene receptors form 1:1 complexes with various
NMBAs with micromolar dissociation constants (Kd), exhibit
excellent selectivity over acetylcholine and hydrophobic
monovalent ammonium ions, and provide a novel alternative
to Sugammadex as NMBA reversal agents.
It can also be challenging to identify the correct receptor and
dye pairs for differential sensing, because each pair should yield
a detectable change in emission upon binding, and multiple
such pairs are necessary to form the sensing array. Dynamic

combinatorial chemistry (DCC) allows rapid multicomponent
receptor synthesis and is a powerful strategy for quickly
determining the “right’’ receptors for a specific target. Different
building blocks can be combined within the same guest-
templated synthesis reaction to form optimized cyclophane
receptors in the presence of a guest.32,33 The receptors that
show good affinity and/or are suitable for IDA can be revealed
by dye displacement, HPLC, ESI-MS, or NMR.34,35 To further
enhance the discovery throughput and speed up the selection
of the proper receptor and dye combinations, the Waters group
developed the “imprint-and-report” approach (Figure 2b).36
This employs either the analyte or the fluorophore as the
template for creation of dynamic combinatorial libraries
(DCLs), which generated a large data set comprising distinct
fluorescence signals. Subjecting this data set to PCA revealed
new analyte-specific receptors or receptor−dye pairs useful for
IDA sensing, depending on whether the analyte or the dye was
the template. Fluorophore templation was much faster and
consumed less material, and so was more suitable for sensor
array development. Since receptor purification is no longer
needed in this approach, synthesis optimization is straightfor-
ward.36 An array of receptor−dye pairs was successfully
identified for the unprecedented, complete differentiation of all
Arg and Lys methylation states in peptides.
These two studies focused on sensing biologically important
targets with similar structural motifs: soft cations. The majority
of analytes targeted in differential sensing with macrocyclic
receptors contain “soft nitrogen-containing cations”, simply
because they are the best substrates for aromatic receptors
such as CB[n]s, calixarenes, and cyclophanes. Negatively
charged analytes are far more challenging to sense, especially in
aqueous solution. Some success has been achieved for analysis
of small anions,37 lipids,38 sugars,39 phosphates,40 and
nucleotides,41 mainly relying on electrostatic interactions
between the hosts and analytes. Still, it is challenging for
synthetic receptors to provide strong and selective binding to
macrobiomolecules, as antibodies do, because their small,
inflexible cavities limit the size, shape, and charge of groups
that can be recognized. Recently, a group of more flexible,
complex synthetic receptors, i.e., self-folding deep cavitands,
were applied to recognize more difficult targets such as nucleic
acid folded structures. These assays were built upon an indirect
sensing mechanism: the hosts were employed as fluorescence
modulators rather than the recognition element, using the dyes
as the primary recognition motif and adding the hosts as
competitive sensing elements.
The deep cavitand array was applied to discriminate G-
quadruplex (G4) topologies (Figure 3a).42 Although the
secondary structures of nucleic acids have an important
influence on their cellular functions, it is not a simple task to
rapidly identify and classify different folded structures. The
sensor array was formed using 5 deep cavitands and 2 cationic

DNA-interacting dyes (which are good guests for the
cavitands). Since the dyes can interact with both the cavitands
and the DNA targets, several binding equilibria could occur
simultaneously, including competitive binding of the dye
between cavitand and DNA, and formation of heteroternary
complexes among the dye, G4, and cavitand. These differential
interactions result in distinct fluorescence patterns generated
from G4 structures of identical length but varying topological
types. Different G4s that display the same folding topology can
also be easily differentiated by the number of G-quartets and
sequence differences. Treating the fluorescence patterns with
Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) can successfully
classify the G4s by their topology, providing a simple method
that is complementary to common techniques like Circular
Dichroism (CD) in revealing the folding topology of any G4
sequences.
After addition of new dyes and new hosts, the array was
challenged to detect more diverse DNA folding motifs like
hairpins, i-motifs, triplexes, and other G4s, which included
structures with the same broad folding category but carrying
subtle differences, such as G4 with vacancies or bulges, and
either parallel or antiparallel triplexes. By applying machine
learning algorithms to the sensing data, we successfully
predicted the folding state of unknown DNA strands (Figure
3b).43 This design does not require the discovery and synthesis
of specific binding ligands to the folded structures, but rather
employs a simple multicomponent approach and selective
molecular recognition to ensure both high selectivity and wide
applicability.
While IDA requires an indicator to convert the host−guest
binding to a readable signal, a simpler approach is to build the
fluorophore into the receptor and modulate the fluorescence
directly by host−guest interactions, as has been shown by the
Huang group.44 They found that exposing the solid, non-
fluorescent pillar[4]arene[1]quinone to the vapor of ethyl-
enediamine can turn on the fluorescence in the solid state. This
phenomenon was attributed to the restriction of intermolecular
π−π interactions among the hosts upon binding to ethylenedi-
amine (EDA) that prevent aggregation-induced quenching.
This method not only can help selective sensing of
ethylenediamine in the presence of other aliphatic amines in
gas phase, but also has important applications in the
preparation of organic solid-state fluorescent materials through
guest vapor adsorption (Figure 4a).
Besides fluorescence, other optical signaling mechanisms
have been used in synthetic receptor-based molecular sensing,
most of them with the hosts immobilized on solid supports. A
recent work showed that conjugating macrocyclic CB[n]s (n =
5−8) on Au nanoparticles (AuNP) produced high-quality
substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)
(Figure 4b).45 SERS can produce fine spectroscopic finger-
prints for specific analyte identification, but signal enhance-
ment is strongly influenced by the location of substrate
molecules relative to the plasmonic hotspots, which can be
assisted by host−guest interactions, as recently demonstrated
in single-molecule SERS.46 Thus, this work employed CB[n] as
the rigid spacer to precisely control the interparticle spacing of
AuNP aggregates, generating uniform plasmonic hotspots.
Interestingly, CB[7], which has a proper cavity size to fit the
analyte, rendered 10× lower SERS signals than CB[5], the
cavity of which is too small for analyte inclusion. It was
speculated that the analyte was interstitially incorporated into
the space between the particles, i.e., the plasmonic hotspots,
enhancing the SERS signals, as opposed to inside the CB
cavity, which was too small for analyte binding. This design
was applied to quantitatively detect tetrahydrocannabinol and
its derivatives with high sensitivity.
■SYNTHETIC RECEPTORS FOR MOLECULAR
SEPARATION
Selective, noncovalent interactions between synthetic hosts
and guests can help improve molecular separation. The
receptors are much smaller and cheaper than antibodies and
are thus more suitable for use as additives in a separation
matrix or column decorators to interact with analytes and
manipulate retention. Host−guest interaction with fast on-and-
off binding rates can help to provide high column efficiency,
whereas strong and stable binding can be exploited in affinity
separation.
Highly water-soluble synthetic hosts such as CB[n]s and
calixarenes can be directly added to the aqueous running
buffers to assist separation by capillary electrophoresis (CE).

Recently, tetrasulfonatocalix[4]arene (CX4), hexasulfonato-
calix[6]arene (CX6), and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) were
employed to help separate methylated peptides by CE.47
Since they bind differentially to methylated lysines with
different methylation states or at various sites on the peptide,
they can resolve histone peptides carrying different lysine
methylations effectively. The method was also be exploited to
analyze the activities of methylation enzymes.48
A remarkably stable host−guest pair is formed between
cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and adamantylammonium (AdA),
with a Ka > 1012 M−1,49−51 comparable to that of the
streptavidin−biotin or antibody−antigen complexes. CB[7]
was recently employed to purify protein therapeutics (e.g.,
monoclonal antibody or cytokine proteins) site-specifically
modified by AdA.52 Agarose beads conjugated with CB[7]
captured the AdA labeled proteins, which can be easily
recovered by addition of a stronger guest, N-(1-adamantyl)-
ethylenediammonium (Ad−EDA).
The Wang group also used CB[7] to mediate site-specific
protein immobilization and biocompatible release of the
captured proteins (Figure 5a).53 CB[7] can bind to the N-
terminal phenylalanine residues on proteins with micromolar
Kd. An oligopeptide with a terminal Phe was then designed and
covalently linked with a bait protein that can specifically
recognize methyllysine on proteins. The peptide−bait
conjugate was immobilized on the CB[7]-functionalized resin
for enrichment of methyllysine proteins in cell lysates. Elution
of the methylated proteins can be stimulated by AdA. These
mild, nondenaturing conditions are much more desirable than
other denaturing conditions such as acidic pH, chaotropic
reagents, and high temperatures usually needed to elute
proteins from antibodies, protein receptors, or aptamers. This
method was found to be highly compatible with mass
spectrometry and produced low background and high signal/
noise ratios, outperforming the commonly used antibody
enrichment or immobilized metal affinity (i.e., Ni(II)-nitrilotri-
acetic acid (NTA)) methods (Figure 5b).
■SYNTHETIC RECEPTORS FOR INTRACELLULAR
APPLICATIONS
Synthetic receptors can be exploited for in vitro and in vivo
imaging, with fluorescence still being the dominant signaling
method and often employing IDA for signal production upon
analyte recognition.54 However, applying IDA for bioimaging
is challenging, and a number of roadblocks still need to be
overcome. These include high background due to insufficient
indicator quenching, nonspecific signals produced by interfer-
ing molecules present in biological environments, and low
spatial resolution caused by the diffusion of the released
indicators. Xiao and Guo developed a Förster resonance
energy transfer (FRET)-assisted IDA to overcome these
challenges, and the system allowed successful ATP imaging
in live cells (Figure 6a).55 In this platform, the amphiphilic
supramolecular receptor, low-rim-dodecyl-modified guanidine-
calix[5]arene (GC5A-12C), was assembled with amphiphilic
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-12C) to form micellar nano-
particles.
FRET donors (perylene
and 9,10-bis(2-
phenylethynyl)anthracene) were trapped in the hydrophobic
inner space of the nanoparticles, which greatly enhanced their
fluorescence. In addition, FRET acceptors like fluorescein,
orange G, and eosin Y were also entrapped, quenching the
fluorescence of the FRET donors. The donor/GC5A-12C/
acceptor assembly can enter the cells efficiently via caveolae-
mediated pathways and ATP-dependent micropinocytosis.
Once in the cells, the intracellular ATP displaced the FRET
acceptors and recovered the fluorescence of the donors. This
work demonstrates that FRET can help enhance the
applicability of IDA in bioimaging by minimizing the
background noise, and donor encapsulation in micellar
aggregates is an effective way to diminish signal diffusion,
enhancing spatial resolution in imaging. More importantly, it
illustrates the power of synthetic receptors in mediating signal
stimulation through reversible host−guest interactions.
Synthetic hosts can aid drug delivery by stimulating rapid
and on-demand control of the location and function of
therapeutic compounds.56 Guo and Chen proposed a strategy
of biomarker displacement activation (BDA) and employed it
to help deliver therapeutic peptides into cells. In this design,
the micellar nanoparticles coassembled by GC5A-12C and
PEG-12C and used in the aforementioned FRET-assisted IDA
was employed as drug carrier.57 The receptor GC5A-12C can
strongly bind to therapeutic phosphopeptides (Ka values
∼106−108 M−1) but not the unphosphorylated ones, and the
binding can be reversed under high ATP concentrations. The
phosphopeptides can disrupt abnormal protein−protein
interactions and regulate cellular processes that could be
applied in disease cures. However, they cannot enter cells
easily due to the phosphoryl dianionic charges. Since the ATP
concentration in the extracellular environment is low (<5 μM),
the PEGylated hosts can help deliver the phosphopeptides
across the cell membrane. Once inside the cells, the higher
concentration of intracellular ATP (1−10 mM) then triggers

the release of phosphopeptides (Figure 6b). This type of
reversible host−guest interaction has also been exploited by
the Zhang group58,59 and the Wang group60 to trigger drug
release by intracellular guests or environmental factors.
Macrocyclic receptors can also be used in combination with
nanoparticles to enhance drug delivery.61−63 One interesting
approach that utilizes synthetic receptors to promote cell entry
of NPs was recently reported.64 In this work, AuNPs (diameter
∼15 nm) coated with pyranine, a negatively charged ligand,
induced strong protein adsorption in cell culture media.
However, protein corona formation can be prevented by the
addition of the oligocationic covalent cage A (Figure 6c),
which can form a zwitterionic host−guest complex on the
particle surface. Reduced protein adsorption effectively
enhanced cellular uptake of the AuNPs. This strategy was
also applied to control corona formation on Au nanorods
(AuNRs, length × width 29 × 9 nm), a potential reagent for
photothermal therapy. Once in the cells, these AuNRs induced
local heating under irradiation of near-infrared light and caused
cytotoxicity.
■CONCLUSIONS
As has been shown by the recent developments summarized
above, supramolecular receptors have important roles in
bioanalysis and drug transport. They provide selective binding
to guests, as do macrobiomolecules (i.e., antibodies, protein
receptors, aptamers, etc.), but they have other advantages such
as smaller size, simpler design and production, and easier
modification. They can either form a standalone sensor for
rapid and sensitive target detection or be combined to establish
an array to differentiate a large group of analytes with high
structural similarity. They can also be coupled to supporting
materials without impeding their abilities in selective target
recognition to facilitate spectroscopy measurement, imaging,
separation, or drug transport. Their reversible binding with
guests can be exploited to trigger the release of the bound
analytes, under much milder conditions than those needed to
overcome antibody−antigen, protein receptor−ligand, or
aptamer−target interactions. Employing synthetic receptors
in drug development can help alleviate obstacles in stability,
biodistribution, and delivery that hamper the clinical
applications of traditional theranostic platforms.
Still, several challenges remain. These include applications in
highly complex matrices for measurement of real-world
mixtures, workload reduction during synthesis of new
receptors and indicators, simplification in data collection and
interpretation, and improvement in stability and reproduci-
bility of sensing signals. Different sensing mechanisms than
IDA should be proposed and tested to meet the demands in
rapid, reliable, sensitive, specific, and/or long-term monitoring
of diverse analytes of interest.
One final point is that the field is dominated by a series of
privileged macrocyclic structures. Cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins,

calixarenes, and pillararenes have many benefits and have
provided a wealth of research targets, but their favored target
motifs are quite similar. As the applications of receptors in
complex biological environments become more popular, new
types of host structure must be synthesized. The ideal targets
would hopefully exploit orthogonal recognition mechanisms
from those shown by electron-rich toroidal (and shallow bowl-
like) macrocycles: this would expand target scope exponen-
tially and allow new methods of minimizing interference from
species present in cellular matrices. This could enhance the
utility of synthetic receptors in affinity purification and in
intracellular applications like imaging and drug transport.
Besides, the loading capacity and types of guest molecules, as
well as the triggered release mechanisms, should be improved
to facilitate more diverse biomedical applications of synthetic
receptors.
