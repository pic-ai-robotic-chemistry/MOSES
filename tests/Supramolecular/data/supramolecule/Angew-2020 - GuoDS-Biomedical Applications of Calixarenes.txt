Biomedical Applications of Calixarenes: State of the Art
and Perspectives
Abstract: 
Calixarenes (CAs), representing the third generation of supramolec-
ular hosts and one of the most widely studied macrocyclic scaffolds,
offer (almost) unlimited structure and application possibilities due to
their ease of modification, which allows one to establish a large
molecular library as a material basis for diverse biomedical applica-
tions. Moreover, CAs and their derivatives engage in various nonco-
valent interactions for the facile recognition of guests including bio-
active molecules and are also important building blocks for the fab-
rication of supramolecular architectures. In view of their molecular
recognition and self-assembly properties, CAs are extensively applied
in biosensing, bioimaging, and drug/gene delivery. Additionally, some
CA derivatives exhibit biological activities and can therefore be used as
new therapeutic agents. Herein, we summarize the diverse biomedical
applications of CAs including in vitro diagnosis (biosensing), in vivo
diagnosis (bioimaging), and therapy.

1. Introduction
Over the past decades, supramolecular chemistry has
become strongly linked to the life sciences.[1] Molecular
recognition and self-assembly processes, such as those
involved in phosphate and carbohydrate recognition,[2]
nucleic acid assembly,[3] and protein folding,[4] play important
roles in biological systems, which has inspired the develop-
ment of numerous artificial supramolecular systems with rich
architectures and functions,[5] as exemplified by enzyme
mimics,[6] artificial channels,[7] and artificial viruses.[8] As
a natural feedback to life systems, biomedical applications
are a significant functional output of supramolecular chemis-
try, encompassing supramolecular biomedical materials,[9]
medicine,[10]
apy,[11] supramolecular theranostics,[12] and self-assembling
prodrugs,[13] to name just a few. The past decades have
witnessed progress in supramolecular chemistry that paves
the way to precision (or personalized) medicine. Compared to
covalent approaches, noncovalent ones display several advan-
tages, e.g., they avoid tedious syntheses and complicated
friendly as well as time- and cost-effective.[14] Moreover, the
dynamic nature of noncovalent interactions allows for the
convenient dissociation and reconstruction of supramolecular
materials, enabling their recycling and self-healing. Addition-
ally, the certain adaptability of noncovalent interactions in
response to external stimuli can be used for the design and
fabrication of stimuli-responsive materials. Finally, supra-
molecular chemistry uses the “bottom-up” principle and thus
provides an alternative way of controlling material size and
morphology.


Macrocycles like crown ethers, cyclodextrins (CDs),
calixarenes (CAs), cucurbiturils, and pillarenes are important
objects of study in supramolecular chemistry. Among them,
CDs are the most widely investigated supramolecular hosts,
comprising oligosaccharides linked by a-1,4 glycosidic bonds
and featuring good solubility in water, molecular recognition
and self-assembly abilities, and biocompatibility. These prop-
erties make CDs well suited for biomedical applications, such
as drug delivery, gene therapy, bioimaging, and pharmaceutics
a-, b-, and g-CDs are listed in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia,
while a- and b-CDs are also listed in the European
Pharmacopoeia. Moreover, b-CD is listed in the U.S. Phar-
macopoeia and is generally recognized as safe by the Food
and Drug Administration.[16] In the 1950s, CDs were reported
to enhance the solubility and stability of drugs via host–guest
complexation.[17] In 1976, the first CD-containing pharma-
ceutical product was marketed in Japan (Prostarmon ETM
sublingual tablets). After 12 years, CD-containing products
appeared on the European market, making their way into the
U.S. in 1997. To date, at least 54 CD-containing pharmaceut-
ical products are in clinical trials or have even been clinically
has inspired the development of several other macrocycles for
application in biomedical fields, namely calixarenes, cucurbi-
turils, pillarenes, and cavitands.[12b,18] Although the clinical use
of these macrocycles is currently (end of 2019) not extensively
characterized, early studies have suggested the broad pros-
pects of these macrocycles for various biomedical applica-
tions.[9,14]


CAs, representing the third generation of supramolecular
hosts, are macrocycles comprising phenolic units linked by
methylene groups at positions 2 and 6.[19] These compounds
have been described as macrocycles with (almost) unlimitedstructure and application possibilities, because they possess
tunable scaffolds and controllable conformations, and can be
easily modified.[20] The abundance of CA derivatives with
diverse recognition and assembly properties results in diverse
biomedical applications.[21] Despite the availability of several
pivotal reviews on the biomedical applications of CAs,[21,22]
most of them mainly focus on only one aspect, and only few of
them are comprehensive, which is especially important given
the fast progress in this field. In view of the above, we herein
systematically summarize the typical biomedical applications
of CAs, such as in vitro diagnosis (biosensing), in vivo
diagnosis (bioimaging), and therapy (drug delivery, gene
transfection, therapeutic agents), discussing the potential
challenges and perspectives of this field. Moreover, we
provide a short overview of CAs for readers less familiar
with these hosts and illustrate CA toxicity in consideration of
their biomedical applications. Although every effort has been
made to demonstrate the diverse biomedical applications of
CAs with the help of representative works, this review cannot
be viewed as fully inclusive, as missing some related works is
inevitable.


2. Overview of Calixarenes
In 1872, Adolph von Bayer reported the first results
concerning products obtained from the reaction of phenol
with formaldehyde.[23] However, he failed to isolate or
characterize these products after numerous attempts. In
1944, Zinke and Ziegler blocked the para-position of
phenol by using para-tert-butylphenol and proposed a cyclic
tetramer structure for the product of its reaction with
formaldehyde.[24] After the 1970s, Gutsche demonstrated the
presence of cyclic homologues, in particular the tetramer,
hexamer, and octamer, by NMR spectroscopy, showing how
the most common CA macrocycles can be obtained in good
yield and with high selectivity under appropriate conditions
(base, solvent, temperature, etc.).[25] Besides, Gutsche first
proposed the name “calixarenes” by structural analogy with
the form of the ancient Greek calix-krater vases. This name is
now generally used, because the systematic IUPAC terminol-
ogy is too complicated. The simplified nomenclature of CAs
uses [n] to denote the number of phenolic units in the
macrocycle (calix[n]arene, CnA); for example, C4A contains
four units.
The facile derivatization of CAs is one of the key features
that makes them unique among other macrocycles. The
hydroxyl groups at the lower rim provide excellent handles
for the incorporation of other moieties via reactions with
electrophiles, as exemplified by O-acylation and O-alkyla-
tion.[20] For the upper rim, almost all common substitutions
possible for phenols/phenol ethers have been carried out for
CAs or their alkyl ether derivatives, e.g., halogenation,
nitration, sulfonation, sulfochlorination, and coupling with
diazonium salts.[20] The methylene bridge can be brominated
by N-bromosuccinimide to prepare a wide array of methyl-
ene-modified
derivatives.[26]
Methylene-bridge-substituted
CAs can also be obtained by stepwise synthesis.[27] Further-
more, one can also replace the methylene bridge carbon with
other atoms, such as sulfur and oxygen.[28] Control over the
number and position of introduced substituents allows one to
synthesize a plethora of CA derivatives.[20,21] Moreover,
considering the tunable scaffold and controllable conforma-
tion, one can establish a large molecular library of CA
derivatives (Scheme 1) as a material basis for biomedical
applications.


Recognition and assembly are two important aspects of
supramolecular chemistry. CA cavities can provide multiple

ular biomedical materials.noncovalent (hydrophobic, p···p stacking, cation···p, and
CH···p) interactions,[29] while CA conformations can be kept
mobile to exploit induced-fit binding or be finely locked in
pre-organized structures for more specific binding.[22a,30] CAs
can recognize guests of various sizes. For example, C4A is
suitable for small guests, while C8A is suitable for larger ones.
Furthermore, CA recognition behavior is largely dependent
on decorating groups. For example, the introduction of
negatively charged sulfonate or carboxyl groups provides
electrostatic as well as hydrogen-bonding interaction sites,
resulting in strong affinity for cationic guests.[31] In contrast,
CAs modified with positively charged guanidinium units
tightly bind various organic and inorganic anions.[32] Deep
cavitands derived from CAs are capable of encapsulating
large hydrophobic guests.[22e] In addition, the recognition
properties of CAs are due not only to the presence of cavities,
because the modification of CA scaffolds with individual
ligands to afford podand-like structures also plays a significant
role in molecular recognition.[33] Thus, the variability of
scaffolds, conformations, and substitution patterns allows
CAs to bind a wide range of guests, such as inorganic
anions,[34] inorganic cations,[35] organic anions,[36] organic
cations,[37] neutral organic molecules,[38] and biological macro-
molecules.[39]
In addition to exhibiting recognition properties, CAs are
also important building blocks for the fabrication of supra-
molecular architectures, such as micelles, vesicles, nanofibers,
tubes, capsules, cages, rotaxanes, catenanes, supramolecular
Among
the
various
assemblies,
CA-based amphiphiles,
which can be obtained by simple modification of hydro-
philic/hydrophobic groups on upper/lower rims, are most
frequently engaged in biomedical applications. Macrocyclic
amphiphiles are a type of pre-organized cyclic oligomers of
amphiphiles, comprising multiple hydrophilic residues at one
rim and multiple lipophilic residues at the other rim, thus
containing both bola- and gemini-type amphiphiles in a single
molecule from the viewpoint of structural characteristics and
Unsurprisingly, macrocyclic amphiphiles, integrating recog-
nition and assembly, have been denoted as “surfactants with
host–guest recognition sites” and represent a new matrix for
biomedicine.[42] Compared to other macrocycles, CAs are easy
to modify, providing plentiful building blocks. For example,
more than 400 CA amphiphiles have been reported.[40b]
Additionally, CAs can form supra-amphiphiles via CAinduced aggregation.[22d,40a,43] Hydrophilic CAs can promote
the self-aggregation of aromatic or amphiphilic molecules by
lowering their critical aggregation concentration (CAC),
enhancing aggregate stability and compactness, and regulating the degree of order in aggregates.[44] The fascinating
assembly behavior, along with the aforementioned recognition properties, especially for biological substrates, provides
supramolecular approaches to realizing biomedical applications of CAs.


3. Toxicity
mation, metabolism, and other properties of some CA
derivatives have been well studied.[31a,45] CA toxicity depends
on the appended groups and can therefore be regulated
accordingly.
Most CAs are remarkably nontoxic.[22a] p-Sulfonatocalix-
[n]arenes (n = 4, 6, 8, 1–3 in Scheme 2) are a prominent family
of water-soluble CA derivatives with numerous biomedical
applications and extensively studied toxicities. In 2004, Cole-
man et al. reported that 1 exhibits no hemolytic effects at
concentrations of up to 200 mm.[46] For 2 and 3, although
hemolytic effects were observed at the above concentration,
they were significantly reduced at lower concentrations. In
2006, Coleman et al. claimed that 1–3 show no activation of
neutrophils, i.e., do not illicit an immune response, even at
relatively high concentrations.[47] In 2008, these authors
studied the in vivo toxicity of 1 and confirmed that this
species exhibited no toxicity at doses of up to 100 mgkg@1.[48]
In 2009, Wheate et al. examined the cytotoxicity of 1 using in
vitro growth inhibition assays in A2780 and A2780cis
(corresponding cisplatin-resistant daughter line) human ovar-
ian cancer cell lines, revealing that 1 displays no cytotoxicity
at concentrations of up to 1.5 mm.[49] Dunlop et al. reported
that a series of p-phosphonic acid CnAs (n = 4 and 5) bearing
hydroxyl groups or variable-length alkyl chains at lower rims
(4–10) had almost no toxicity.[50] The authors examined the
effect of these compounds on the viability of rat PC12 cells,
showing that no effect was observed at concentrations up to
1 mgmL@1. Our group recently reported a carboxyl-modified
azocalix[4]arene (11) with negligible cytotoxicity against
A549 cells even at 50 mm.[51] Loftsson et al. examined the
lammonium-modified C4A (12), revealing the absence of
cytotoxicity up to 200 mm in tests on mouse macrophage RAW
264.7 cells.[52] In terms of hemolytic activity toward rabbit red
blood cells, 12 was not active at concentrations of up to
100 mm. In addition, assemblies based on amphiphilic CAs
(13, 14, and 15) were shown to exhibit no or negligible
cytotoxicity and in vivo toxicity by us and other groups.[53]
The toxicity of some CA derivatives can be useful in
certain cases. Sebti and Hamilton reported significantly
cytotoxic C4A derivatives that could inhibit tumor growth
and angiogenesis, with the lowest IC50 observed for 16.[54]
Viola et al. reported that C8A carrying an N-acetyl-d-glucos-
amine group (17) inhibits glioma cell migration and prolifer-
ation, and is thus a potential novel anticancer drug.[55] Most

4. Biosensing
The sensing of biomolecules is critical for the early
screening of diseases and accurate diagnosis, facilitating
effective treatment and even improving patient survival
rates. Biomolecules are substances found in blood, urine,
stool, or tissues, and are generally ions, amino acids, proteins,
or neurotransmitters. As a kind of artificial receptors, CAs
possess discrete cavities selective for the complementary
binding of certain guests. At the same time, unlimited
modification possibilities also allow for recognition based
on podand-like ligands. Hence, CA derivatives have drawnconsiderable attention and significantly contributed to the
field of host–guest recognition.[57] Kim and Gibb have
reviewed CA-based fluorescent receptors, focusing on those
for metal ions and anions.[22k] However, the use of CAs for
sensing other biomolecules has not been comprehensively
summarized. Herein, because of space limitations, we review
the applications of CAs in biosensing, focusing on cases where
CAs directly interact with analytes. These applications can be
classified into direct and competitive sensing, depending on


4.1. Direct Sensing
Direct sensing features signaling and recognition units as
two indispensable components. Analyte binding induces
a signal change, and vice versa, signal measurements can be
Leray et al. synthesized two CA derivatives (20 and 21)
toward the cation because of electrostatic attraction, which
increases the charge density around the crown ring oxygens
and the charge transfer efficiency of coumarin, resulting in
a red-shifted absorption spectrum and enhanced fluorescence
and was applied to monitor extracellular K+ levels. Rao et al.
reported C4A derivatives (22 and 23) for the sensing of
that complexation with analytes enhanced the fluorescence of
fluorescence of 24 was quenched in the presence of Cu2+
water and living cells.[65] Menon et al. reported a tryptophan
(Trp) and histidine (His) sensing system based on a substituted
C4A fluoroionophore (25).[66] The addition of Trp to a solution
of 25 resulted in fluorescence enhancement, while His
induced

quenching
Benefiting
from high association constants, this sensing system exhibited
high selectivity and sensitivity, and was successfully applied
for the selective detection of Trp and His in blood serum.
In addition to acting as scaffolds for podand-like ligands,
CAs also provide cavities as recognition units (Scheme 3b).[67]
Thiol-functionalized CAs can be easily attached to the surface
of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), which strongly absorb in the
visible region and exhibit color-tunable behavior. CA-func-
tionalized AuNPs have been used to sense various analytes.[68]
For example, Menon et al. employed them for the colorimet-ric sensing of creatinine, which is an indicator of kidney
problems.[68c] Compound 26 was grafted onto AuNPs, and its
complexation with creatinine resulted in nanoparticle aggre-
gation and, hence, in color changes (Figure 2a). The practical
applicability of this system was confirmed by the reliable and
accurate sensing of creatinine in human urine.
In addition to the covalent tethering of signaling units to
responsiveness to the desired analytes. Jin et al. modified
CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with an amphiphilic CA
derivative (27) to sense acetylcholine (ACh) based on the
fluorescence quenching observed upon complexation of 27
contributions from both static and dynamic mechanisms and
the dynamic mechanism was the main contributor. Schrader
Amphiphilic C4A (28) showed high affinities to arginine
(Arg)- and/or lysine (Lys)-rich proteins and could be incor-
porated into a stearic acid monolayer on water, benefiting
from amphipathy. The addition of basic proteins to the mixed
monolayer produced moderate but distinct additional expan-
sions of pressure/area diagrams because of complexation with
groups (29 and 30) were introduced to realize the sensing of
acidic proteins by the same strategy.[71] On the basis of the
above research, Schrader et al. co-assembled a phospholipid
with polydiacetylene, which changed color from blue to red in
response to stimuli such as heat, ionic strength, and mechan-
ical pressure.[72] The addition of proteins in the presence of
CAs caused an obvious color change and thus allowed for
protein detection by the naked eye.


4.2. Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) and Differential Sensing
Competitive binding, in which a series of guests compete
for a receptor, is a well-established approach in supramolec-
ular chemistry. The exploitation of competitive binding for
sensing applications, so-called competitive sensing, has a long
history and is exemplified by IDA.[58,73] In a typical IDA
experiment, an indicator is bound to a receptor to create the
sensing ensemble, and subsequent analyte introduction causes
the displacement of the indicator out of the receptor.[73] Since
the complexation of CAs with chromophores generally results
in changes in optical (fluorescent or colorimetric) signals, the
molecular recognition of CAs has been widely used in IDA
(Scheme 4a). Recently, Hof proposed the DimerDye disas-
sembly assay (DDA), which also takes advantage of com-
petitive binding (Scheme 4b).[74] Competitive sensing is
compatible with differential sensing, because the array can
ACh plays a modulatory role in the central nervous
system and is involved in the translation of chemical signals
into electrical ones. Nau et al. reported a sensing system for
ACh, choline, and carnitine based on the IDA strategy,
employing
p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene
diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (DBO) as a reporter pair.[75]
The addition of 31 to DBO solutions resulted in efficient
fluorescence quenching, while ACh, choline, and carnitine
derivatives caused the regeneration of fluorescence by
displacing DBO out of 31. Yitzchaik et al. studied the role
of the CA skeleton in the sensing of ACh using p-
sulfonatocalix[4,6,8]arenes (SCnA, 31, 32, 33) as hosts and
trans-4-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium-p-tol-
uenesulfonate (4ASP) as an indicator.[76] The association
affinities of these reporter pairs equaled & 105m@1, and
complexation induced a drastic increase (20- to 60-fold) of
the fluorescence intensity of 4ASP. Fluorescence titration
experiments showed that 32 was the most suitable host,
because the cavity of 31 was too small, while that of 33 was toolarge and flexible. Jin et al. reported the interfacial sensing of
ACh.[77] Specifically, 34 was incorporated into dimyristoyl
phosphatidylcholine vesicles, and rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) was
employed as an indicator. The replacement of ACh with
Rh6G resulted in changes of steady-state fluorescence,
fluorescence anisotropy, and fluorescence correlation spec-
troscopy signals. The authors pointed that the selectivity of
this vesicle system was not exactly the same as that of the
parent compound 34 in homogenous solution, which sug-
gested that membrane potential also played an important
role. Jin et al. also employed a near-infrared-fluorescent dye,
rhodamine 800, for ACh sensing based on the IDA strategy to
increase the suitability of the sensing platform for biological
systems.[78]


IDA has also been applied to the sensing of other
substrates.[79] Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive
phospholipid considered to be an ideal biomarker for the
early detection of ovarian and other gynecologic cancers.[80]
Our group has constructed an LPA sensing system based on
the IDA strategy, using fluorescein (Fl) as an indicator and
guanidinium-modified C5A (35), which has a suitable cavity
size and can provide salt bridge, C@H···p, C@H···O, and
This well-designed system showed excellent selectivity and
sensitivity, with an LOD of 1.7 mm, and was employed for the
determination of LPA in untreated serum. The linear
relationship between fluorescence and LPA concentration
made it possible to construct a calibration curve to accurately
determine the level of LPA even in the low-mm range
IDA displays several advantages such as receptor univer-
sality, allowing one to modulate the sensitivity and selectivity
of sensing systems. However, one disadvantage of IDA is that
various co-solutes, such as NaCl, can reduce performance.
Hof et al. reported a refined competitive sensing system
CA to form two new merocyanine CAs (36 and 37).[74,82] Both
these CAs self-assembled into non-emissive dimers in aque-
ous solution, and guest addition resulted in dimer dissociation
and turned on fluorescence (Scheme 4b). This strategy,
denoted as the DimerDye disassembly assay (DDA), was
applied to the sensing of amino acids, and the signal intensity
slightly decreased after salt addition.
The differential sensing strategy aims to mimic the
mammalian nose and tongue to sense smell and taste,
respectively, achieving analyte sensing via the composite
response of the entire array of receptors (Scheme 4c).
Compared to direct sensing, IDA is more compatible with
differential sensing, because one can easily construct an array
by changing receptors and/or indicators without additional
synthetic efforts. Hof et al. extensively worked on sensing Lys
and post-translationally modified Lys,[83] reporting a sensor
array for differentiation of different degrees of methylation
(monomethyl (Lys(Me1)), dimethyl (Lys(Me2)), and trimethyl
(Lys(Me3))) and acetylation (Lys(Ac)).[84] These authors
employed SC4A (31), SC6A (32), and monobrominatedSC4A (38) as receptors, and lucigenin (LCG) and pyridino-
pyrene as indicators. The addition of different amino acids
produced an array of signals, and the obtained data were
Notably, these amino acids could be well distinguished. The
above sensing system was then employed to sense Lys and
distinguish its modifications in peptides.
Our group reported the discrimination of glycosamino-
glycans (GAGs).[85] Four positively charged CA derivatives
(35, 39–41) were chosen as hosts, and Eosin Y was chosen as
a reporter dye. Six GAGs with slight structural differences,
viz. heparin (HEP), hyaluronic acid (HA), dextran sulfate
(DS), chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), chondroitin sulfate B
(CSB), and chondroitin sulfate C (CSC), were chosen as
target analytes. The different structures of these CAs resulted
in different binding affinities with GAGs, and hence, in
different output signals. Principal component analysis (PCA),
LDA, and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) allowed for the


4.3. Supramolecular Tandem Assay (STA)
STA, proposed by Nau, can be considered as a time-
resolved version of IDA.[59] In contrast to IDA, the key idea of
STA is that the competitor is created but not added. STA can
be used to determine the activity of enzymes in real time,
requiring significant differences in binding affinities between
the macrocyclic hosts and enzyme substrates/products.[86]
During an enzymatic reaction, the dynamic binding of
a fluorescent dye with a macrocyclic host in competition
with substrate and product binding is measured (Scheme 5).
The above strategy was applied to investigate the hydrolysis
of Arg to ornithine catalyzed by arginase using 31 as the host
and DBO as the reporter dye.[87] The corresponding associ-
ation constants were obtained as 6400, 550, and 60000m@1 for
Arg, ornithine, and DBO, respectively. As the affinity of Arg
to 31 exceeded that of ornithine, the enzymatic reaction
resulted in dye entrance into the cavity, and, hence, in
a gradual switch-off of fluorescence. The same strategy was
used to probe acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline oxidase,
and methyltransferase activities.[88] Additionally, Liu et al.
employed STA to sense butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a chol-
inesterase that always coexists with AChE in vertebrates.[89]
The abnormal activity of both BChE and AChE is an
indicator of some diseases. The above authors constructed
a system that could generate qualitatively differentiated
signals for AChE and BChE. The reporter pair was 31 +
LCG, and the substrate was succinylcholine, which can be
degraded by BChE but not by AChE. Fluorescence intensitydecreased upon BChE addition, but did not change in the
presence of AChE (Figure 6).


In collaboration with Prof. Nau and Dr. Hennig, our group
constructed a phosphorylation-responsive membrane trans-
port system and applied it to sense the activity of protein
kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) (Figure 7).[90]
Amphiphilic CAs (42 and 43) were found to effectively
activate the membrane transport of cell-penetrating peptides
(CPPs). Then, two CPPs were designed as substrates for PKA
(P1) and PKC (P2). The association constants of dephos-
phorylated peptides with 42 were an order of magnitude
higher than those of phosphorylated peptides. These differ-
ences in binding affinities resulted in different abilities of 42
to activate peptides. Incubation of P1 with PKA decreased
transport activity, and the extent of this decrease was
positively correlated with incubation time and PKA concen-
tration. The same trend was observed for PKC and P2.
Reporter pairs can also be used to monitor time-resolved
changes of analyte concentration without the occurrence of
a chemical reaction, as exemplified by the development of
tandem membrane assaying as a versatile supramolecular
method to monitor biomembrane transport processes.[91] In
this method, a membrane-impermeable reporter pair is
encapsulated inside vesicles. When an analyte with a strong
affinity to the host translocates into the vesicles, a time-
resolved change in fluorescence due to the displacement of
the dye from the host cavity is observed. This method was
used by Nau et al. to investigate the diffusion of protamine
through the bacterial channel outer membrane protein F
(OmpF).[92] First, proteoliposomes loaded with the 31·LCG
complex were prepared. The steep increase in fluorescence
observed upon the addition of protamine indicated its
concentration-gradient-driven translocation into liposomes
incubated live cells with the 31·LCG complex, which resulted
in its spontaneous uptake.[93] Subsequent addition of bioor-
ganic analytes having high affinities to 31 and capable of
entering cells induced fluorescence turn-on. Thus, a method
of detecting the uptake of bioorganic analytes by live cells was
developed.

5. Bioimaging
Contrast agents enabling the visualization of structures
inside the human body and the delineation of healthy tissues
from diseased ones significantly aid clinicians in choosing the
proper
treatment.
Therefore,
numerous
bioimaging
approaches have been invented and used for clinical diag-
nosis, e.g., computed tomography, magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI), positron emission tomography, single-photon
emission computed tomography, optical imaging, and photo-
acoustic imaging.[94] CAs find numerous applications in the
field of bioimaging, mainly in optical and magnetic resonance
5.1. Optical Imaging
Optical imaging has many prominent advantages such as
sensitivity and low cost. CAs are well suited for optical
imaging because they can change the spectral properties of
dyes via host–guest interactions, providing a wide platform for
imaging. Nau et al. employed CAs to monitor the cellular
uptake of biomolecular analytes, relying on the fact that 31
can form a stable host–guest complex with LCG to quench its
fluorescence.[93] Importantly, both the host and guest are
biocompatible and exhibit low toxicity. Incubation of the
above complex with live V79 and CHO cells resulted in its
spontaneous uptake and was followed by the addition of
bioorganic analytes (ACh, choline, and protamine). These
analytes had high affinities to 31 and could replace LCG,
causing a fluorescence switch-on response (Figure 9). The
authors believed that this live-cell-based IDA provides
a simple and cost-effective screening tool to monitor the
uptake efficiencies of compounds that can bind CAs.
Our group has recently reported imaging systems respon-
sive to tumor microenvironments. Hypoxia is a central feature
of many diseases including tumors and is an indicator of
tumor aggression, poor prognoses, and therapeutic outcomes.
An azo-group-containing CA derivative (11) prepared by us
showed high affinity to the commercial dye rhodamine 123
(Rho123) and quenched its fluorescence.[51] In a hypoxic
environment, azo groups can be reduced to release Rho123
and recover fluorescence (Figure 10). This strategy was
validated through hypoxia imaging in living cells treated
with the 11·Rho123 reporter pair. Furthermore, negligible
cytotoxicity was observed under experimental conditions.
This noncovalent strategy based on host–guest chemistry
exhibits several intrinsic advantages such as adaptability to
other probes/treating agents and highly accurate release
under hypoxia. Another well-known feature of tumors is
biomarker overexpression. For example, the concentration of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in tumor tissues exceeds that
in normal tissues & 10000-fold. Therefore, our group pre-
pared a guanidinium-modified C5A pentadodecyl ether (13)
with an extraordinarily high affinity (nm range) to commercial
dyes and ATP.[53a] The binding of dyes with 13 resulted in
fluorescence quenching, and the strong affinity precluded
unwarranted off-target leakage during blood circulation. In
tumor tissues, strong binding to ATP caused the release of
dyes as well as the recovery of fluorescence. Furthermore, 13
is able to self-assemble into vesicles with a size of 115 nm,
which can be used to secure the enhanced permeability and
retention (EPR) effect. This strategy was summarized as
biomarker displacement activation (BDA) and used for in
vivo imaging.


Liu et al. recently reported a two-stage enhanced fluores-
cence method for lysosome-targeted cell imaging.[96] The
synthesized dye, named ENDT, exhibited weak fluorescence
emission at 625 nm, which was enhanced and red-shifted upon
complexation with cucurbit[8]uril (first stage). The obtained
complex assembled into nanorods, and the subsequentaddition of amphiphilic C4A (43) resulted in fluorescence
enhancement (second stage) and the formation of nano-
particles (Figure 11), which were used for near-infrared
lysosome-targeted cell imaging.
In addition to the cavity, the CA skeleton also contributes
to optical imaging. Klymchenko et al. reported superior
brightness fluorogenic nanoparticles based on the micelles
lated cyanines (Figure 12), and the size was close to that of
single proteins (3–7 nm), which is ideal for cellular imaging.
The CA-based nanoparticles were found to be approximately
twofold brighter than quantum dots, and were applied to cell
imaging, showing a distribution typical of endosomes and
lysosomes. The above work provides a new principle for the
development of protein-sized ultrabright fluorescent nano-
particles.


5.2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRI is one of the most important bioimaging techniques,
featuring the advantages of non-invasiveness, absence of
scattering or high-energy radiation, and suitability for 3D
imaging. Although paramagnetic GdIII complexes are widely
used as MRI contrast agents, the challenge is to prepare stable
complexes that do not release toxic metal ions in vivo.
Casnati et al. reported a CA derivative (45) capable of
complexing GdIII in aqueous solution.[98] The relaxivity of the
corresponding complex was constant at pH 4–9, i.e., the
structure of this complex was stable in a proton concentration
range spanning five orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the
association constant of 45 with GdIII (1 X 1013m@1) was
sufficiently high to ensure the binding of the integrated
complex to human serum albumin (HSA), which indicated
that this complex can be applied as a blood-pool agent for
angiography. Peters et al. reported an amphiphilic CA
derivative (46) suitable for use as an MRI contrast agent.[99]
In water, this compound formed micelles with a relaxivity
about twice that of the monomer. The rotational correlation
time of the monomer (390 ns) was close to the optimal value
predicted for high-field contrast agents. Both the monomer
and micelles were very rigid systems with negligible local
contributions to the overall rotational dynamics.


6. Drug Carriers
Drug delivery systems employ formulation strategies,
encapsulation technologies, and/or targeted approaches to
enhance the performance of drugs via (i) improving drug
solubility,
stability,
biocompatibility,
(ii) sustainable
release of drugs to change pharmacokinetics, (iii) provision
of passive and/or active targeting, (iv) provision of a platform
for theranostic systems, combination therapy, and controlled
release.[100] To date, numerous carriers have been explored for
drug delivery, e.g., liposomes, polymers, dendrimers, gold
nanoparticles, and proteins.[100,101] As drug carriers, CAs offer
the advantages of well-defined molecular structures with
precise sizes and determined molecular weights, host–guest
recognition sites and various drug loading sites, amphiphilic-
ity for controllable assembly, and ease of targeting and
response group modification. Consequently, numerous CA-
based drug delivery systems have been reported and broadly
categorized as those featuring drug loading within the cavity,
drug loading within the assembling regions, and CAs con-
taining nanovalves for controlled release (Scheme 7).


6.1. Drug Loading within the Cavity
Noncovalent encapsulation of drugs into CA cavities has
reported the complexation of 1 and 2 with carvedilol (CDL),
a poorly water-soluble drug, revealing that this complexation
greatly increased CDL solubility and demonstrating a linear
relationship between CDL solubility in water and CA

in
after two days at 378C, while at pH 5.5, the above release was
accomplished within 5 h. This difference was explained by
considering the pKa of phosphonic acid head groups (7.2):
protonation at pH 5.5 decreased polarity and destabilizedvesicles. Cell assays showed that the introduction of CA
vesicles increased the efficacy of carboplatin toward ovarian
cancer cells 4.5-fold, lowered IC50 10-fold, and markedly
increased the percentage of cells in the S-phase (DNA
replication) of the cell cycle. Our group has realized
activatable photodynamic therapy (PDT) based on the
hindered by its unexpected dark toxicity due to the “always-
on” model and low tumor specificity. In our strategy, a photo-
with the photoactivity and fluorescence completely annihi-
lated and released by overexpressed biomarkers (ATP) in
tumor tissues. The above system was successfully used for
tumor imaging and targeted therapy in vivo, paving a new
avenue for theranostics. The BDA strategy has several
advantages, e.g., the employment of approved PSs, adapt-
ability to different PSs, and traceless release of PSs with high
fidelity. As a follow-up to this work, our group developed
Y (a kind of PS)-modified hyaluronic acid, which exhibited
hyaluronidase-triggered
disassembly
and
ATP-activated
release of Eosin Y, which is thus potentially suited for
precision delivery with respect to tumor phototheranostics.[105]
In addition to being loaded in cavities at the periphery of
assemblies, drugs can also be loaded in cavities at the
assembly core. Zhou et al. developed a PS delivery system
based on the self-assembly of PEGylated C4A (14). The
grafted PEG arms endowed CAwith solubility in the aqueous
phase, and binding with PSs resulted in the formation of
supramolecular amphiphiles that self-
assembled into supramolecular polymer-
lation of PSs into CAs avoided the
aggregation of PSs and fluorescence
self-quenching. Chlorin e6 (Ce6) was
employed as a hydrophobic model PS
in this work. Micelles formed by 14·Ce6
had a diameter of & 100 nm and could be
preferentially
because of the EPR effect. In vitro
experiments showed that 14 had low
cytotoxicity and that 14·Ce6 exhibited
higher PDT efficacy than free Ce6.


6.2. Drug Loading within Assembling
Regions
In the case of assemblies, in addition
to being loaded in cavities, drugs can also
be loaded within the assembling regions
(Scheme 7d–f).[100,102g,106]
developed a vehicle for the in vivo
delivery of curcumin using 47, showing
into
micelles
(average size = 3.86 nm) with high cur-
cumin encapsulation efficiency.[107] Cell
culture experiments suggested that these
micelles could sustainably release curcu-
min in a pH-dependent manner and inhibited the prolifer-
ation, invasion, migration, and tumor spheroid formation of
BT-549 cells more efficiently than the free drug. This
enhanced performance was ascribed to the fact that micelleswere taken up by pinocytosis and acted as a curcumin depot
inside cells to prevent the precipitation of this drug. The
enhancement of drug solubility, eye surface permanence, and
penetrability is a topic attracting much attention. Consoli
et al. developed potential eye drops by entrapping curcumin
in a choline-modified C4A (48)-based nanoaggregate.[108]
Choline is an alkoxyamine that is well tolerated by the eye
and can cross the cornea via low-affinity facilitated diffusion.
The positive charge of choline can electrostatically interact
with the negatively charged ocular surface and mucus.
Aggregation successfully enhanced the solubility (9000-fold)
and stability (7.5-fold) of curcumin. The effects of curcumin
on inflammation and oxidative biomarkers was also improved
via the formation of 48 nanoaggregates. The same trend was
also observed in vivo, indicating the high potential of this
system for ophthalmic applications.


Drugs can be loaded both in hydrophobic and hydrophilic
used in ophthalmology for the diagnosis of dry eyes, was
encapsulated in the corresponding micelles, which success-
fully improved RB lipophilicity and enhanced its capacity to
cross biological barriers such as cell membranes.
In addition to the traditional amphiphilic assembly, CAs
can also be assembled into supra-amphiphiles for drug
delivery. In 2012, Liu et al. developed a cholinesterase-
responsive drug delivery system, employing 31 and enzyme-
cleavable myristoylcholine to form binary vesicles that were
highly specifically and efficiently dissipated by cholinester-
firmed by trapping a fluorescence dye inside vesicles as
a beacon. As both myristoylcholine and myristic acid
(enzymatic reaction product) form micelles, myristoylcholine
itself could not realize the release of loaded drugs, which
that cholinesterase is a key protein overexpressed in patients
with AlzheimerQs disease, the above system has potential for
the delivery of related drugs. Liu et al. also developed another
enzyme-responsive drug delivery system, employing 31 to
bind protamine (as an enzyme-cleavable guest) and form
binary vesicles.[111] In the presence of serine protease trypsin,
protamine was converted to amino acids and peptides,
promoting the rupture of vesicles and the release of drugs
encapsulated therein. The system featured high selectivity,
i.e., other enzymes such as Exo I could not cause drug release.
CAs can also induce the assembly of drugs into nano-
structures, usually with a high drug loading efficiency
(Scheme 7g). In 2014, Liu et al. employed 31 and 51 to
assemble the small-molecule antipsychotic drug chlorproma-
zine into nanostructures with loading efficiencies of 61 and
46%, respectively.[112] The presence of the host–guest recog-
nition sites of 51 on the outer layer surface allowed a targeting
agent, trimethylated chitosan, to be further noncovalently
anchored onto nanoparticles. In 2015, the above authors
proposed a “drug chaperone” concept.[113] Specifically, twodrugs (Irinotecan and Mitoxantrone) were directly co-assem-
bled with an amphiphilic CA (52), and the targeting ligands,
biotin-pyridinium
and
hyaluronic
acid-pyridinium,


6.3. CA-Containing Nanovalves for Controlled Release
A nanovalve is a molecular machine fabricated by
combining a movable part with a covalent attachment to
a solid nanoparticle supported at the pore opening.[114] In view
of their controllable recognition ability, macrocycles (includ-
ing CAs) are widely used as nanovalve components (Sche-
me 7h). Yang et al. developed a series of functionalized
mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) based on CAs for
drug delivery, including an enzyme-responsive system,[115] and
an ACh-responsive system.[116] In 2016, they developed dual-
responsive MSNs based on 31 and 32.[117] These MSNs were
functionalized with cleavable disulfide-bond-containing alky-
lammonium stalks and encircled by CAs. The presence of
CAs reduced premature cargo release. Cargo was efficiently
released either in response to l-glutathione (GSH), via
cleavage of disulfide bonds in the stalks, or in response to
pH variation, via reduction of the CA–MSN binding affinity


7. Gene Delivery and Transfection
Gene delivery, i.e., the introduction of foreign DNA or
RNA into host cells, is important for both fundamental
research and biomedical applications.[118] Naked DNA and
RNA exhibit very poor capacity to transfect cells because of
the presence of barriers and low stability.[119] Therefore,
efficient gene delivery requires the use of specially designed
nucleic acid vehicles. A number of viral vectors have
successfully progressed to clinical trials and even to the
market.[120] However, as their widespread applications are
limited by intrinsic immunogenicity and high production
costs, numerous nonviral vectors such as lipids, polymers,
dendrimers, and macrocycles have been designed.[121] Macro-
cycles are an emerging class of molecules for this application,
featuring persistent shapes and thus allowing for a higher
level of supramolecular organization of DNA complexes.[122]
As the third generation of macrocyclic hosts, numerous CAssized Arg- and Lys-modified CAs (64–66) and compared their
transfection efficiencies in the absence and presence of
DOPE with those of LTX and polyethyleneimine (PEI)
(Figure 17c,d).[129] Among these species, 65 showed the
highest efficiency.
Junquera et al. constructed lipoplexes using the amphi-
philic tetraalkylammonium-modified C4A (67), DOPE, and
DNA pEGFP-C3.[130] The transfection efficiency of 67/
DOPE-pDNA lipoplexes was evaluated by measuring the
GFP expression level in HEK293T cells by fluorescence
microscopy. The best transfection performance was observed
at a fraction of 67 of 0.2 and an effective charge ratio of 20.[130]
Klymchenko et al. synthesized a choline-modified amphi-
philic C4A (68) that could self-assemble into 6-nm-diameter
micelles and deliver DNA.[131] The addition of DNA caused
aggregation and an increase of micelle diameter to 50 nm
(Figure 18). These nanoparticles showed high gene trans-
fection efficiencies in cell cultures, while poorer performance
Sakurai studied the transfection efficiency of amino-
modified C4A-based lipids with different alkyl chain lengths


8. Therapeutic Agents
In addition to being applied as pharmaceutical excipients,
macrocycles themselves can also be used as therapeutic
agents, generating the concept of macrocyclic therapeutics.
Macrocyclic molecules, which do not carry any encapsulated
or covalently linked pharmaceutical agents, can show bio-
medical activities. For example, CDs can be applied as
neuromuscular block antidotes, regulators of cholesterol
metabolism, anti-infective agents, and antitoxins.[5,133] More-
over, cucurbiturils and pillarenes can be used to treat
paraquat poisoning.[134] The ease of CA modification has
resulted in the generation of a large corresponding material
library, and many CA derivatives have greatly promoted the
8.1. Antibacterial, Antifungal, and Antiviral Properties
Numerous CAs have been reported to exhibit antibacte-
rial and/or antifungal activities.[136] The abundance of avail-
able substituents endows CAs with a variety ways to kill
bacteria/fungi, e.g., via membrane disorganization, DNA
damage, and inhibition of DNA replication. The structures,
bioactivities, and action modes of CAs are summarized in
Conditions related to infection with the human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV) cause numerous deaths every year.
Regnouf-de-Vains et al. synthesized nine C4A derivatives
(31, 113–120; Scheme 8) and studied their anti-HIV proper-
ties and cytotoxicity.[150] Most of these compounds had
antiviral activities of 10–50 mm, while no cytotoxicity was
observed at concentrations up to 100 mm. Hamilton et al.
synthesized a series of C4A derivatives (121–131) and studied
their abilities to inhibit HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infections, showing that the introduction of lower-rim alky-
lation to maintain the cone conformation is important for
potent dual antiviral activity.[151] In addition, aromatic iso-
phthalate spacers at the upper rim were essential for anti-HIV
activities, and diacid groups were necessary for anti-HCV
effects.
In addition, CAs can also inhibit HIV by regulating the
related proteins. Luo et al. designed a series of C4A-based b-
diketo derivatives (132–140) as novel HIV-1 integrase inhib-
itors with stand transfer inhibition IC50 values of 5.9–
21.2 mm.[152] The molecular docking results for 134 and 139
suggested that the macrocyclic skeletons of C4A bind to the
hydrophobic cavity in the prototypic foamy virus integrase
reported to interact with lectins and act as inhibitors.[153]
Sansone et al. synthesized four mannosylated CAs (141–
144) and studied their properties as dendritic cell-specific
ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) binding inhibi-
tors.[154] HIV exploits the interaction between the mannose-
rich structures of its envelope glycoprotein gp120 and DC-
SIGN to be transported toward T-cells and infect them. The
above authors used a mannosylated BSA as a model of HIV
gp120 and evaluated the capability of CAs to inhibit bindingbetween DC-SIGN and the mannosylated BSA by SPR. In

Yan et al. prepared a series of CnA (n = 4, 6, and 8)
polyhydroxyamine derivatives (145–157 in Scheme 9) and
studied their antitumor activities using six cancer cell lines.[156]
The IC50 values of 145–148 ranged from 1.6 to 11.3 mm. Cell
cycle analysis showed that exposure of SKOV3 cells to 145
induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, indicating DNA

jugates (158–162) with anticancer properties that could

Hamilton et al. reported a series of potent C4A-based
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) antagonists (163–177)
able to inhibit PDGF-stimulated PDGF receptor (PDGFR)
tyrosine phosphorylation.[158] CAs were designed to bind to
the three-loop region of PDGFand disrupt its interaction with
PDGFR. As both PDGF and PDGFR are required for tumor
growth and angiogenesis, the disruption of their interaction
resulted in tumor starvation and growth reduction. CAs withdiazo, amide, and glycine linkers (163, 169, 171) had
satisfactory activities, while those with sulfonamide and
urea linkers (170, 172) had low activities. Alkylation at the
lower rim was found to be unnecessary. Compound 178, a CA
derivative with anticancer activity, is currently undergoing
a phase-I clinical trial. In 2006, Mayo et al. reported that 178
can inhibit angiogenesis and features IC50 values as low as
2 mm.[159] According to the suggested working principle, 178
can bind to galectin-1, a carbohydrate-binding protein related
to cancer cell proliferation, and suppress its activity.[160]
Compound 178 also showed synergy with several cytotoxic
and targeted therapies when administered first.[160b] More-
over, the favorable pharmacokinetics (PK) of 178 promoted
its application in clinical therapy.[161]
Sakaguchi et al. reported that C6A derivatives bearing six
imidazole groups (179) enhanced the transcriptional activity
of a mutant p53 tumor suppressor protein.[162] The mutation ofthe TP53 gene, which encodes the p53 protein, causes
multiple tumors because of the destabilization of the tetra-
meric structure of p53. Thermal denaturation curves showed
that 179 could stabilize the p53 structure under physiological
conditions. Furthermore, cellular experiments demonstrated
that 179 also enhanced the transcriptional activity of p53.
C6A (80) was reported to decrease the aggressiveness of
a drug-resistant human pancreas carcinoma cell line, leading
to cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase by downregulation of
PIM1 (proviral integration site for the moloney murine
leukemia virus), CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase), CDK4,
and retinoblastoma proteins.[163] The signal transduction of

8.3. Detoxification
Succinylcholine (Sch) is the only depolarizing neuro-
muscular blocking agent. However, this compound exhibits
numerous side effects such as myalgia and prolonged
apnea.[166] Wang et al. used supramolecular therapeutics to
treat these side effects, employing 31, which exhibited strong
affinities to Sch. In an Sch-overdosed mouse model, 31 was
injected immediately after Sch administration. The overall
survival rates significantly increased, indicating successful
detoxification.
8.4. Inhibition of Amyloid Fibrillation
As CAs can interact with a variety of proteins, it is not
surprising that they can also regulate the structures and
functions of these proteins. For example, sol–gel encapsula-
tion of lipase in the presence of CA derivatives enhances its
activity and enantioselectivity.[167] Aminophosphonic acid
modified C4A was reported to inhibit the activity of alkaline
phosphatase,[168] with numerous other examples available.[169]
Herein, we only introduce reports describing how CAs inhibit
amyloid fibrillation, which is related to a wide range of
diseases such as AlzheimerQs disease, ParkinsonQs disease, and
type II diabetes.
The amyloid state of a protein is a highly ordered
aggregate in which the polypeptide chains adopt a fibrillar
structure. Sun et al. reported that 31, 32, and 33 effectively
delayed the fibrillation of amyloid-b (Ab42), which is the
hallmark of AlzheimerQs disease, and exhibited reduced
cytotoxicity (Figure 22).[170] These CAs bound Ab42 with
association constants of the order of 103m@1, and their
effectiveness was determined to be in the order of 33 > 32
> 31 according to thioflavin T (ThT, a dye interacting with
fibers and exhibiting fluorescence) assays. The higher effi-
ciency of 33 was ascribed to its larger and more flexible cone,
which resulted in stronger interactions with Ab42 than in the
case of 31 and 32.
Our group recently co-assembled an amphiphilic CA (18)
with an amphiphilic CD to efficiently inhibit amyloid
fibrillation (Figure 23).[53c] Ab42 contains two lysines, which
can strongly bind to 18, and one tyrosine, which is an idealguest for CD. The above platform provided not only multi-
valency but also heterotopicity (heteromultivalency), which
resulted in a very strong affinity to Ab42. Hence, incubation of
Ab42 with an equimolar 18/CD co-assembly resulted in a 75%
reduction in ThT fluorescence intensity, i.e., in a 75%
inhibition of b-sheet aggregation. The co-assembly could
also disintegrate mature fibrils, which was more challenging
and more important from the viewpoint of treatment.


9. Summary and Outlook
In summary, CAs have been widely applied in biomed-
icine, e.g., for biosensing and bioimaging, contributing to in
vivo and in vitro diagnosis.[172] Moreover, CAs have been used
to construct drug and gene delivery systems, which contrib-
uted to targeted therapy. Additionally, the antibacterial,
antiviral, anticancer, detoxification, and amyloid fibrillation
inhibition activities of CAs promote the development of
macrocyclic therapeutics. Such abundant biomedical applica-
tions benefit from the rich (supramolecular) chemistry of CAs
and their broad chemical design space attributable to the ease
of CA modification. The supramolecular chemistry of CAs
paves the way to the exploration of biomedical functions. CAs
have unique recognition properties, as their cavity can not
only specifically recognize guests, but also quench the
fluorescence and photoactivity of several dyes, which makes
CAs suitable for turn-on fluorescence sensing, imaging, and
activatable PDT. The CA skeleton can also be applied as
a podand-like ligand for constructing novel recognition
systems. CAs also possess excellent assembly properties. For
example, because of their pre-organized framework, CA
amphiphiles can form more stable and compact assemblies
than the corresponding monomers. Therefore, amphiphilic
CA-based drug/gene delivery systems often exhibit better
performances than polymer-based ones. However, in contrast
to polymers, CA amphiphiles have more defined molecular
structures with precise size and molecular weights, which
ensures batch-to-batch consistency and is an advantage for
clinical translation and regulatory approval. Notably, the CA
cavity size can be adjusted by changing the number of
phenolic units and can be adapted to different functions. For
example, the optimal cavity size of C5A allows it to selectively
and strongly bind LPA, which cannot be achieved by either
smaller or larger analogues.[80] CAs also exhibit the benefit of
conformation controllability (and hence, control of physico-
chemical properties and biomedical functions). For example,
guanidinium-modified C4A in cone conformation exhibits the
highest DNA transfection efficiency, as it has a more suitable
lipophilicity than C4As in 1,3-alternate and mobile confor-
mations.[128a] These intrinsic features, including ease of
modification, selective and strong binding to biological
substrates, stable and compact assembly, tunable scaffold,
and controllable conformation, collectively make CAs a priv-
ileged
platform
for
diverse
biomedical
applications


Although these early works showed the biomedical
potential of CA homologues for biosensing, bioimaging,
drug/gene delivery, and therapeutics, examples of clinical CA
use remain few at the time of this writing. The bench-to-
bedside translation is highly demanded for the biomedical
applications of CAs. Currently, one CA (178) is undergoing
a phase-I clinical trial, which is a good trend. Nevertheless,
CAs still face many practical challenges in biomedical
applications from the viewpoints of both scientific research
and clinical trials. For in vitro diagnosis, sensing systems
should be further developed into sensors or even kits to make
the biosensing application practical in clinical settings. For in
vivo diagnosis and therapy, further studies of CA safety are
required, e.g., those of long-term toxicity effects, metabolic
pathways, and immunoreactions. With regard to optimization
of diagnosis and therapy performance, some advanced modal-
ities such as multimodal imaging, multiple targeting, and
combination therapy can be employed and studied. More-
over, despite the large number of reported CA derivatives,
their physicochemical properties and biomedical functions
remain underexplored. Exploration of the new functions of
existing CAs is imperative, requiring the collaborative efforts
of multidisciplinary experts including those working in thefields of supramolecular chemistry, chemical biology, life
sciences, pharmacy, and medicine. We think that numerous
new tricks can still be accomplished with old molecules. In
turn, one can summarize the inherent relationship between
molecular structures and biomedical functions to guide the
design of new CA derivatives. With continued research and
development efforts, we believe that humanity will greatly
benefit from CA-based biomedicine in the near future.
