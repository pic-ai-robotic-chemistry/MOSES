1. Introduction
Anions have an enormous impact upon our lives. Within
our own bodies, the carrier of our genetic information—
DNA—is anionic, as are the majority of enzyme substrates
and cofactors (e.g. ATP). Amongst the halides, chloride is
found extensively in extracellular fluid, with its misregulation
being linked to diseases such as cystic fibrosis,[1] iodide is
required for the biosynthesis of hormones by the thyroid
gland,[2] while fluoride is considered essential for healthy bone
and teeth growth, which has led to the (sometimes contro-
versial) artificial fluoridation of water supplies.[3] In the case
of other anions, it is well-established that bicarbonate is vital
in the maintenance of pH levels in the body, whereas cyanide
is highly toxic.
Certain anions have an adverse effect on the environment
around us. Nitrate and sulfate are key components in the
production of acid rain.[4] Excessive use of phosphates and
nitrates in fertilizers has led to eutrophication in waterways.[5]
Pertechnetate (a by-product of nuclear fuel reprocessing)[6]
and perchlorate (arising from the manufacture of explo-
sives)[7] are two further examples of anthropogenic pollutants,
while arsenate is an example of a naturally occurring one.[8] In
short, there has been, and still is, considerable motivation for
investigating the binding and sensing of anionic species.
In 1968, Park and Simmons described the binding of
halide anions by macrobicyclic ammonium cages (Fig-
ure 1a).[9] A year previously, Shriver and Biallas had reported
the formation of a chelate between a diboron ligand and
a methoxide ion (Figure 1b).[10] These are generally consid-
ered to be the first examples of anion coordination and hence
the point of genesis for anion supramolecular chemistry.
Initially there was very little progress in the coordination
chemistry of anions, in comparison to that of cations, where
Pedersens seminal reports on macrocyclic crown ethers[11]
heralded the development of an array of cation-binding
ligands, including Lehns cryptands[12] and Crams spher-
ands.[13] This lack of development in the field of anion
recognition has been attributed, in part, to a number of
intrinsic properties associated with anionic species. Anions
are larger than their isoelectronic cations, and hence will have
smaller Coulombic interactions with an equivalent charged
receptor. Anions may be sensitivity to changes in pH, that is,
become protonated at low pH values and possibly lose their
negative charge. Even simple inorganic anions are known to
have a wide range of possible geometries, including spherical,
linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral. It has also been noted
that anions, in comparison to cations, possess high free
energies of hydration. The degree of solvation of an anion in
water varies from ion to ion, and is reflected by the
Hofmeister series. In a hydrophobic binding site, inaccessible
to solvent, less hydrated anions are bound more strongly. On
the other hand, anions which are more hydrated are typically
held more strongly in receptors with open cavities.
Despite these challenges, research on anion coordination
gently began to develop momentum. Seminal early contribu-
tions came from Lehn and co-workers, who developed a large
number of polyammonium receptors, including macrocycles,
where optimal binding in aqueous media was observed for
dicarboxylate anions of complementary size to the length of
Since the start of this millennium, remarkable progress in the binding
and sensing of anions has been taking place, driven in part by
discoveries in the use of hydrogen bonding, as well as the previously
under-exploited anion–p interactions and halogen bonding. However,
anion supramolecular chemistry has developed substantially beyond
anion recognition, and now encompasses a diverse range of disci-
plines. Dramatic advance has been made in the anion-templated
synthesis of macrocycles and interlocked molecular architectures,
while the study of transmembrane anion transporters has flourished
from almost nothing into a rapidly maturing field of research. The
supramolecular chemistry of anions has also found real practical use
in a variety of applications such as catalysis, ion extraction, and the use
of anions as stimuli for responsive chemical systems.

the receptor (Figure 2a),[14] and Schmidtchen, who reported
innovative quaternary ammonium hosts able to bind halides
within their cage structure (Figure 2b).[15] In spite of this slow
beginning, anion supramolecular chemistry featured heavily
in Lehns Nobel Prize lecture of 1987.[15]
In 2001, Beer and Gale published a review on anion
recognition and sensing[16] which, in particular, highlighted
the important advances made in the design and construction
of neutral hydrogen bond anion receptors that primarily
function in organic solvents, as well as the construction of
optical and electrochemical anion sensors.
Developments in anion recognition have subsequently
continued to flourish to the extent that today anion supra-
molecular chemistry has evolved substantially beyond the
realms of the chemistry of anion receptors. Although
imaginative research continues on the binding and sensing
of anions, during the last ten years or so large strides have
been made in areas which were new and underdeveloped,
such as the use of anions as templates and for transportation
and importantly in chemical applications such as catalysis, ion
extraction, and responsive materials.
Considering the depth and diversity of anion supramolec-
ular chemistry today, we cannot contemplate producing
a comprehensive review of the topic. Instead we seek to
provide an overview of the most significant and substantial
developments in the field since 2001, as well as providing
some indication of where we expect the area to develop in the
second decade of this century.[17]
2. Fundamental Advances in Anion Recognition
Previously, anion receptors have been usefully classified
by consideration of the type of noncovalent interaction used
to complex the anionic guest.[16] Although receptors employ-
ing electrostatic interactions are able to bind anions in water,
hydrogen bonding, which is considerably weaker, has tradi-
tionally been considered insufficient to bind anions in
aqueous conditions. The directionality offered by hydrogen
bonds, however, means that appropriately designed neutral
receptors can be constructed to bind anions with different
geometries in aprotic polar solvents. Ureas[18] and amides[19]
are popular choices of hydrogen-bond-donating functional
groups, partly because of their expedient synthesis. Pyrroles,
notably as calixpyrroles, have been shown to be particularly
efficient anion receptors in polar organic solvents because of
the lack of a competing hydrogen-bond acceptor.[20] Highly
effective anion receptors can be produced by combining
electrostatics and hydrogen bonding; recent examples of such
motifs operable in aqueous solvent media include guanidi-
nium,[21] imidazolium,[22] and pyridinium moieties.[23] Lewis
acidic atoms, being electron deficient, are able to bind anions
by participating in the formation of a bonding interaction
through orbital overlap with an anion, which acts as an
electron-donating species. In addition to boron,[10,24] other
elements including silicon[25] and tellurium[26] have been
employed to generate such anion receptors.
In this Review we do not provide an exhaustive com-
mentary on this research.[27] Here, we concentrate on what
may be considered to be the most important fundamental
advances in anion recognition since 2001. We first highlight
key developments in hydrogen-bonding anion receptors.
Hydrogen bonding is widely utilized in a range of anion
supramolecular chemistry activities (e.g. as templates and for
transportation), and recent developments are often exploited
in these applications. Secondly, we discuss the appearance of
receptors based on new noncovalent interactions, specifically
those using anion–p and halogen bonding.

development of functional supramolecular
systems, with a particular focus on guest
recognition and sensing.

1990, he moved to the University of Oxford,
where he became a Professor of Chemistry
in 1998. His research interests cover many
areas of coordination and supramolecular
chemistry, in particular the binding and
sensing of anions by macrocycles and inter-
locked molecular host systems.

2.1. Critical Developments in Receptors Utilizing Hydrogen
Bonding
2.1.1. New NH-, OH-, and CH-Containing Receptors
Neutral squaramides—a particular class of NH hydro-
gen-bond donor, that are derivatives of 3,4-diaminocyclobu-
tene-1,2-dione (Figure 3)—were demonstrated to act as
effective anion receptors in competitive solvent media (such
as DMSO) as early as 1998.[28] Since the turn of the century,
numerous examples of squaramide anion receptors have been
reported,[29] where their effectiveness is believed to be due in
part to an increase in the aromatic character of the
squaramide ring upon anion complexation.[30] An illustration
is provided by a comparison of diaryl squaramides with their
analogous ureas by Fabbrizzi and co-workers.[31] With halides,
the di(nitrophenyl)squaramide (Figure 3b) formed consider-
ably stronger complexes (by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude) than
the analogous urea receptor in acetonitrile. In contrast,
oxoanions were bound by each receptor with almost identical
association constants. The enhancement of halide binding by
the squaramide was attributed to the presence of convergent
C(aryl)H bonds that can act as additional hydrogen-bond
donors.
The indole-containing amino acid tryptophan may be
found as a NH hydrogen-bond donor in the anion-binding
site of the sulfate-binding protein.[32] The indole functional
group, like pyrrole, lacks competing hydrogen-bond acceptors
(in contrast to amides and ureas), but is more acidic than its
monocyclic counterpart. Indoles, along with carbazoles and
indolocarbazoles, are representative examples of heterocyclic
NH hydrogen-bond donors that have been investigated in
recent times (typically in combination with other hydrogen-
bond donors) as potent anion receptors.[33]
For example, Gale and co-workers synthesized pyridine-
2,6-dicarboxamide and isophthalamide molecules which pos-
sessed pendent indole groups (Figure 4a).[34] These receptors
proved to be highly selective for fluoride over chloride (for
example) in [D6]DMSO/0.5% water mixtures, which was
attributed to the “twisted” conformation of the receptor
encapsulating the smaller fluoride ion, whereas chloride
“perches” on the receptor, as evidenced in a solid-state
crystal-structure determination. Previously, Jurczak and co-
workers had reported on carbazole/amide receptors (Fig-
ure 4b).[35] These molecules were found to bind benzoate and
dihydrogen phosphate much more strongly than chloride in
[D6]DMSO/0.5% water. The first reports of anion complex-
ation with indolocarbazoles were made by the Beer research
group, where it was demonstrated that, in acetone, simple
indolocarbazoles bound benzoate strongly (typically logKa >
5).[36] Jeong and co-workers have since incorporated indolo-
carbazoles into a range of macrocyclic receptors (Fig-
ure 4c).[37] Chloride is bound more strongly by the smaller
cyclic receptor (in 10% MeOH/acetone), whereas the larger
anions investigated were bound more strongly to the larger
receptor, indicative of a degree of complementarity between
the host and guest.
Recently, the use of chiral anions to induce helical
chirality in NH hydrogen-bond-donating foldamer anion
receptors has been demonstrated. This is exemplified by the
tri(indolocarbazole) synthesized by Jeong and co-workers
that forms a chiral helix upon coordination to enantiopure 10-
camphorsulfonate in dichloromethane, as revealed by circular
dichroism (Figure 5).[38] A related example is that of Zhao, Li,
and co-workers, who used the chiral glutamate anion to
induce helical chirality in a benzamide oligomer.[39]
As already mentioned in the Introduction, protonated
bicyclic NH-containing molecules have been known to bind
anions for some 45 years. Interest in such cryptand-like
receptors was rekindled by a 1978 report by Lehn and co-
workers of an azaoxa cryptand, which was shown to selec-
tively bind the linear azide anion in water.[40] This research
area has remained remarkably active, and a large number of
bicyclic receptors have even been reported since 2001.[41]
Notable among these has been the work of Bowman-James
and co-workers, who studied neutral cryptands (prepared by
reacting tri(2-aminoethyl)amine, commonly referred to as
“tren”, with isophthaloyl chlorides), which are able to bind
fluoride with Ka > 105m1 in competitive [D6]DMSO (Fig-
ure 6a).[42] Recently, Mani and co-workers described the
ability of polypyrrolic cryptands to also bind fluoride in
[D6]DMSO (Figure 6b).[43] A notable achievement in this
field has been the selective recognition of the radioactive
pollutant 99TcO4
 by a protonated cryptand in acidic water
(Figure 6c).[44] Amendola and co-workers demonstrated by
isothermal titration calorimetry that the pertechnetate anion
was bound more strongly than either nitrate or chloride by
two orders of magnitude.

The simple, commercially available molecule catechol,
has been found by D. K. Smith[45] to be a remarkably potent
chloride binder in CD3CN (Ka = 1575m1; Figure 7a). Further
study revealed catechol to exhibit greater affinity and
selectivity for chloride (over bromide and iodide) than its
structural
isomer
resorcinol
(Figure 7b).[46]
However,
attempts to functionalize catechol with further hydrogen-
bond donors proved problematic, with an intramolecular six-
membered hydrogen-bonding arrangement found to inhibit
anion binding in a number of the receptors prepared (Fig-
ure 7c).[47]
Recently it has been recognized that the triazole motif
may be utilized as a potent CH hydrogen-bond donor, with
interest in part being driven by the synthetic efficacy of the
Huisgen
copper-catalyzed
azide-alkyne
cycloaddition
(CuAAC) “click” reaction.[48] Being similar in size, planarity,
and dipolar character to an amide linkage, a 1,2,3-triazole
may be considered peptidomimetic. Li and Flood have
demonstrated the very strong binding of chloride and
bromide
by
a
triazolophane
in
dichloromethane
(Fig-
ure 8a).[49] By careful design, a receptor has also been
constructed that binds iodide in a 2:1 “sandwich” complex
(Figure 8b).[50]
Contemporaneous with Floods first seminal reports, the
research groups of Craig[51] and Hecht[52] described the
formation of halide-templated oligotriazole foldamers in
solution. The study by Craig and co-workers revealed their
tetratriazole oligomer bound chloride the strongest (in
[D6]acetone), with the 1:1 oligomer/anion stoichiometry
confirmed by Job Plot analysis (Figure 9a). By the incorpo-
ration of chiral centers onto the backbone, Meudtner and
Hecht were able to probe the chiroptical properties of their
foldamer: intriguingly the handedness of the helix depended
on which halide was present (Figure 9b).
Very recently, Flood and co-workers have demonstrated
the ability of an alternative CH hydrogen-bond donor,
cyanostilbene, to bind anions.[53] A pentagonal “cyanostar”
macrocycle (Figure 10) has been synthesized which binds
large anions (e.g. PF6
) as a 2:1 macrocycle/anion sandwich in
CD2Cl2/CD3OD (3:2). The same macrocycle was also incor-
porated into a [3]rotaxane with a dialkylphosphate axle.
Further examples of anion-templated rotaxanes will be
covered in Section 3.4.

of

donors

a family of cyclic glycouril oligomers

gen bond to a chloride ion through 12
CH···Cl hydrogen bonds in the solid

analogue
soluble
in
organic solvents was later found to
bind halides very strongly in solution
(e.g. Ka(I) = 3.8  109m1), albeit in
noncompetitive chloroform.[54b]
2.1.2. Binding in Aqueous Media with Neutral Hydrogen-Bond
Donors
The ability of a receptor to operate in aqueous media is
essential for medical diagnostics, or for the monitoring of
a pollutant in an environmental sample. As already men-
tioned, it has traditionally been believed that synthetic anion
receptors solely employing hydrogen-bond donors are unable
to operate in such conditions. However, in the last decade,
there have been notable developments in the preparation of
neutral receptors capable of functioning in aqueous media.
In a sustained program of research, the group of Kubik
has investigated synthetic cyclopeptides containing alternat-
ing aromatic and l-proline residues that may act as anion
receptors in solvent media with exceptionally high aqueous
contents, even in pure (i.e. 100%) water. In their first
reports,[55] cyclohexapeptide macrocycles were shown to
bind anions in an 80:20 mixture of D2O and CD3OD solutions.
Whereas the macrocycle bound inorganic anions with a 1:1
stoichiometry in pure DMSO, 2:1 association occurred in
aqueous solutions, with the anion being completely desol-
vated and encapsulated within the sandwich complex (Fig-
ure 12a). Furthermore, one of the macrocycles was able to
bind sulfate in pure D2O, admittedly with a modest associ-
ation constant (Ka = 56m1).[56]
In subsequent work, covalently linking two cyclopeptides
with adipic acid allowed for “molecular oyster” receptors able
to bind sulfate with logKa  5 in a 50:50 mixture of H2O and
CH3OH (Figure 12b).[57] The ability of these receptors to
operate in such competitive solvent media has been accred-
ited to hydrophobic interactions between the two cyclopep-
tide rings that encapsulate the bound anion.[58]
Suk and Jeong have reported the formation of indolocar-
bazole-based foldamers templated by halide anions in water
(e.g. Ka(Cl) = 65m1; Figure 13).[59] This example is partic-
ularly noteworthy, as the required aqueous solubility is
achieved by incorporation of negatively charged carboxylate
groups into the structure of the oligomer, which provides an
electrostatic repulsive contribution that would oppose the
anion-binding event.

a range of anions in [D6]DMSO containing 5% water, and in
the case of H2PO4
 (where R = H, R’ = Me in the receptor) in
[D6]DMSO
containing
25%
water
(Ka = 234m1;
Fig-
ure 14a).[60] In more recent work, combining indole and
urea functionalities has resulted in receptors able to bind
anions in [D6]DMSO containing 10% water, with the binding
of H2PO4
 being observed once again in 25% water solutions
(Ka = 160m1; Figure 14b).[61]
The binding of anions in water by neutral hydrogen-bond
donors is, and will remain, a considerable challenge.[62] For
even though these few examples demonstrate that receptors
with sufficient hydrogen-bond-donor character can be readily
constructed, for such systems to operate in pure water
requires sufficient solubility, a property that—to date—has
proved difficult to concomitantly incorporate.
2.1.3. Understanding Anion Complexation versus Deprotonation
Electron-withdrawing groups may be added to a receptor
to increase the binding strength of hydrogen-bond donors.
This increases the acidity of the hydrogen-bond donor, which
simultaneously increases the likelihood of the receptor being
deprotonated, in particular by basic anions such as fluoride or
acetate. In-depth investigations of this effect have been
carried out by the research groups of Fabbrizzi,[63] Gale,[64] and
Gunnlaugsson,[65] and some illustrative examples are dis-
cussed below.
Titration of TBAF into solutions of a simple urea receptor
(substituted with electron-withdrawing nitrophenyl groups) in
DMSO led to complex behavior being observed beyond
simple hydrogen-bond formation (Figure 15).[66] The first
equivalent of fluoride titrated forms strong hydrogen bonds
with the receptor as expected. However, the addition of
a second equivalent results in deprotonation occurring, with
formation of a stable HF2
 ion. The solution turns a deep
orange as a consequence of the formation of a charge-transfer
state in the deprotonated receptor.
It has been shown that certain amidopyrrole receptors are
also sufficiently acidic to be deprotonated. For example, the
receptor in Figure 16a was deprotonated by fluoride in
CD2Cl2.[67] Once again, two equivalents of TBAF were
required for proton transfer, to allow for formation of the
stable HF2
 species. The amido(thio)urea receptor in Fig-
ure 16b proved to be so acidic that a greater range of anions
caused deprotonation. One equivalent of anion was sufficient
to induce proton transfer in the case of fluoride, acetate,
benzoate, and dihydrogen phosphate. This process was
accompanied by the appearance of a new absorption band
in the UV/Vis spectrum of the receptor.[68]
It should be noted that many colorimetric anion sensors
previously described are now believed to function through
such proton-transfer processes. This should always be kept in
mind, particularly if the anion guest species is basic, such as
a carboxylate or fluoride.
An appreciation has also begun to develop that an acidic
anion may be deprotonated. Titration of excess TBAH2PO4
into solutions of butyl diindolylurea receptor in [D6]DMSO
(Figure 17) led to the observation of a second set of signals
further downfield in the 1H NMR spectrum. This observation

was rationalized by hypothesizing that the pKa value of the
bound H2PO4
 is reduced, which allows for proton transfer to
unbound anion. Evidence for this is provided by the solid-
state structure of the phenyl analogue of the receptor (grown
in the presence of excess TBAH2PO4), where the coordinated
anion is observed to be HPO4
2.[69]
2.2. Exploiting New Interactions To Bind Anions
2.2.1. Anion–p Receptors
The term anion–p refers to the attractive force between an
electron-deficient aromatic p system and an anion.[70] It is
believed that the interaction principally consists of electro-
static forces and ion-induced polarization. The electrostatic
contribution requires the arene to possess a positive quadru-
pole moment, thus demanding the arene rings to be sub-
stituted with electron-withdrawing substituents.
Evidence for anion–p interactions in the solution phase
has only recently been acquired.[71] For example, Berryman
et al. prepared two molecules each containing a sulfonamide
hydrogen-bond donor, where one possessed a neighboring
pentafluorophenyl ring, while the other had an unfluorinated
phenyl ring (Figure 18a).[72] They observed no binding of
halides with the unfluorinated species in CDCl3. Crucially,
weak binding of halides (Ka = 20–35m1) was noted with the
pentafluorophenyl species. In subsequent studies, Berryman
et al. demonstrated that it is possible to recognize halides
solely using anion–p interactions (Figure 18b).[73] The sub-
stitution pattern of the nitro groups prevents halide ions from
hydrogen bonding to the molecule. Despite this, the binding
of the halides (Ka = 26–53m1) was observed in C6D6. The
unsubstituted, protic analogue, which is capable of hydrogen
bonding (but not of anion–p interactions) possesses no
affinity for the halide ions. Wang et al. have reported upon
the ability of an electron-deficient tetraoxacalix[2]arene[2]-
triazine receptor to bind halide ions (Figure 18c).[74] The
dichloro-substituted macrocycle can bind chloride (Ka =
4036m1) in CH3CN, while no binding was observed with
the proto analogue, consistent with a binding mode based on
anion–p interactions.
An anion–p prismatic receptor has very recently been
studied
by
Wasielewski,
Stoddart,
and
co-workers
(Figure 19).[75] The tri(naphthalenediimide) trigonal prism
was shown to bind the I3
 ion with an association constant
of Ka = 25 m1 in CD2Cl2. A solid-state structure determina-
tion confirms that the anion resides within the prismatic
cavity.
Anion–p interactions have perhaps been most notably
exploited in the construction of anion–p slides by Mareda and
Matile (see Section 5.3). These systems are capable of the
transmembrane transportation of anionic species.[76]

2.2.2. Halogen Bonding Receptors
Halogen bonding may be represented by YX···D, where
X is an electrophilic halogen atom, D is a donor of electron
density, and Y is another atom (e.g. C or N).[77] Halogen bonds
arise from the appearance of a s hole at the X end of the YX
bond, into which electron density may be donated. The
strength of the halogen bond follows the trend X = I > Br>
Cl @ F. As the electron-poor region sits on the X pole region
of the YX bond, the halogen bond is considered highly
directional, as usually evidenced—but not always[78]—in the
solid state. The halogen-bonding interaction has perhaps been
most often employed in crystal engineering and liquid
crystals. It is perhaps surprising that only in very recent
times has the application of halogen bonding to anion
recognition begun to be realized.
Taylor and co-workers constructed a receptor containing
a convergent array of halogen-bond donors by incorporation
of ortho-substituted iodotetrafluroroarenes on to a 2,4,6-
trimethylbenzene scaffold (Figure 20a).[79] In acetone, this
receptor was demonstrated to bind halide ions Cl > Br > I,
while not exhibiting affinity for the oxoanions HSO4
 and
NO3
.
It is possible to achieve anion binding in much more
competitive solvent media by utilizing electrostatic interac-
tions. Such charge-assisted halogen bonding is exhibited by
the bidentate bromoimidazoliophane in Figure 20b.[80] The
syn isomer is capable of selectively binding bromide in a 9:1
mixture of CD3OD and D2O. The protic, hydrogen-bonding
analogue (which lacks syn/anti isomerism) exhibits weak,
unselective binding of halide ions. Analogous halogen-bond-
ing naphthalene-containing macrocycles have also been
prepared; in these examples the syn-iodo- and bromo-
substituted macrocycles are able to act as selective fluores-
cence sensors of bromide and iodide, respectively, in CD3OD/
D2O (9:1).[81] A simple iodoimidazolium has also been
investigated (Figure 20c), and shown to selectively bind
H2PO4
 in [D6]DMSO.[82] Once again the protic analogue
exhibits weak, unselective binding of the anions investigated.
A comprehensive isothermal calorimetric study of anion
binding with di(iodoimidazolium) systems (Figure 20d) has
also been carried out in a range of organic solvents. In this
study, the entropic contribution to the overall free energy of
binding was found to be very important.[83]
The simultaneous employment of halogen and hydrogen
bonding to achieve anion binding has also been demon-
strated. Taylor and co-workers measured the contribution of
halogen bonding to the free energy of anion binding in
a di(iodoperfluorobenzoyl)-substituted urea by comparison
with
a
perfluorobenzoyl
analogue
in
CD3CN.[84]
They
observed a significantly greater halogen-bonding contribution
for
the
halides
compared
to
dihydrogen
phosphate
(Figure 21).
3. Anions as Templates
Up to a decade ago, the use of anionic species as templates
in self-assembly had been very much in its infancy, with the
majority of examples being of the serendipitous kind.
Inspection of the literature from this time reveals various
isolated, underdeveloped cases such as Mingos cage[85] and
Lehns helicate[86] (Figure 22), as well as an earlier report by
Hawthorne and co-workers on the role of chloride in the
synthesis of anion-binding mercuraborane macrocycles.[87]
In the following years, the preparation of a significant
number of anion-templated molecules was reported. Salient
examples are now discussed with the focus being specifically
on structures constructed by the strategic use of anions as
templates. Reviews containing more detailed information on
serendipitously produced molecular architectures may be
found elsewhere.[88]
Traditionally, templated synthesis has involved a consid-
ered iterative process based on design, manufacture, assess-
ment, and re-design (possibly aided by computer modeling).
However, the advent of dynamic combinatorial chemistry
(DCC) provides a powerful alternative strategy.[89] In the
DCC approach, a suitably chosen set of building blocks, which
may continuously interconvert, is prepared. The addition of
a template (e.g. an anion) to this dynamic combinatorial
library (DCL) will lead to a shifting of the dynamic equilibria
present, driven by the requirement to minimize the free
energy of the entire library, thereby resulting in the amplifi-
cation of certain product member(s) of the DCL, which may
then in turn be isolated. Both of these methodological

concepts have been utilized in the construction of anion-
templated molecules in the last ten years.
3.1. Anion-Templated Dimeric Complexes and Capsules
The use of anions, with multidentate ligands, to template
the formation of dimeric structures has been notably
exploited in recent years.
For example, Wu, Yang, and co-workers have reported
a coplanar acyclic triurea ligand that forms a 2:1 (L/A)
complex with either phosphate or sulfate in aqueous DMSO
solutions (Figure 23a).[90] Sulfate was shown by Schubert and
co-workers to template the formation of a 2:1 (L/A) complex
with a triazole-triazolium ligand in acetonitrile through
a combination of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic inter-
actions (Figure 23b).[91] Interestingly, the bis(triazolium)
analogue only formed a 1:1 complex with sulfate.
Two classes of tripodal ligands have been widely utilized
for the formation of anion-templated dimeric “capsules”,
namely a) trifunctionalized trialkylbenzenes[92–94] and b) those
based
on
functionalizing
tri(2-aminoethyl)amine
(“tren”).[95–97]
A representative example of the first class of tripodal
ligands is the zwitterionic tri(pyridinium carboxylate) recep-
tor synthesized by Steed and co-workers (Figure 24a).[92] A
single bromide ion can be encapsulated by two equivalents of
the ligand, being augmented by CH···Br hydrogen bonds as
identified by X-ray crystallography. In comparison, function-
alized tren ligands typically form dimeric complexes tem-
plated by polyatomic anions such as phosphate or sulfate. This
is exemplified by the tri(thiourea) of Dey and Das, which
coordinates to phosphate through 12 hydrogen bonds, once
again verified by X-ray crystallography (Figure 24b).[95]
It is noteworthy that the use of tren-based ligands in
industrially useful anionic extraction processes has been
demonstrated. Details of these reports can be found in
Section 6.2.

3.2. Anion-Templated Macrocycles
The exploitation of anions to template the synthesis of
macrocyclic species has been studied intensely over the last
decade. Here, it is notable that, from using simple spherical
halide ions, the use of (inorganic and organic) polyatomic
anions is now being pursued.
The role of chloride in the formation of a di(imidazolium)
macrocycle
was
reported
by
Alcalde
and
co-workers
(Figure 25).[98] Their investigations confirmed that cyclization
is accelerated by a factor of ten in the presence of chloride. It
was proposed that the halide ion hydrogen bonds to the
imidazole and imidazolium moieties, thus supporting the
arrangement of the molecule in a cyclic-shaped transition
state which leads to formation of the macrocyclic product.
The use of a chloride template has also been demon-
strated by Bçhmer and co-workers in the preparation of
a remarkable cyclic hexaurea macrocycle.[99] Reacting the
diamine and diisocyanate (Figure 26) in acetonitrile simply
yields the triurea macrocycle. However, in dichloromethane
the hexaurea macrocycle is also isolated in a yield of 20%. A
crystal structure of this macrocycle (grown in the presence of
TBACl), revealed a figure-of-eight conformation encapsulat-
ing two chloride ions. Evidence of the templating role of
chloride in this macrocyclization was provided by the addition
of two equivalents of chloride to the reaction mixture, which
switched the ratio of formation of the two macrocycles (as
determined from crude 1H NMR spectra) from 5:1 to 1:5.
Notably, the ratio was found to be 1:3 when bromide was used
instead of chloride, but no difference from the halide-free
conditions was observed with iodide.
The Sessler research group has reported upon the role of
the acid counteranion in the reaction of a 2,6-diamidopyridine
diamine and diformylbipyrrole.[100] The use of hydrochloric or
hydrobromic acid resulted in a complicated mixture of
products, whereas sulfuric acid led to the formation of the
[2+2] macrocycle depicted in Figure 27 in 90% yield, aided
by the dynamic nature of the imine bond in acidic conditions.
In the presence of TBAHSO4 or TBAH2PO4, the free base of
this [2+2] macrocycle converts into the larger [3+3] macro-
cycle, which is the major product if phosphoric acid is used in
the original reaction. Anion-binding studies in acetonitrile
revealed that both macrocycles bound H2PO4
 and HSO4

(both tetrahedral anions) the strongest amongst a range of
singly charged anions, including the more basic acetate
oxoanion.
Alfonso, Luis, and co-workers have thoroughly investi-
gated the anion-templated synthesis of pseudopeptidic mac-
rocycles by using aromatic dicarboxylates as templates
(Figure 28).[101] Di(amidoamines) and aromatic dialdehyde

precursors were allowed to react in the presence of a dicar-
boxylate template to form tetraimine macrocycles, which
were isolated after in situ reduction of the imine bonds. A
notable achievement of this template strategy is the prepa-
ration of “structurally disfavored” macrocycles.[101c] This
involved taking specific chiral diamines which when reacted
with 1,4-benzenedicarbaldehyde without the dicarboxylate
template simply form a mixture of long-chain oligomers,
whilst their stereoisomers spontaneously macrocyclized. The
addition of the dicarboxylate template to the reactions of the
“disfavored” substrates led to the formation of the [2+2]
macrocyclic product. More recently, replacing the 1,4-dialde-
hyde with 1,3,5-benzenetricarbaldehyde, and switching the
dicarboxylate for a tricarboxylate template, has enabled the
efficient synthesis of macrocyclic cages.[101d]
3.3. Anion-Templated Metallo-Organic Cages
Contemporaneous with Mingos chloride-templated cage
described above, McCleverty, Ward, and co-workers de-
scribed the formation of a tetrahedral metallo-organic cage
templated by a tetrafluoroborate anion (Figure 29).[102] The
[M4L6]8+ cage consists of four CoII cations at the tetrahedron
vertices, with a di(pyrazolylpyridine) ligand on each edge. The
tetrafluoroborate anion occupies the central cavity and forms
multiple hydrogen bonds to the methylene protons of the
bridging ligands. Later, more detailed solution NMR experi-
ments definitively proved the anion functioned as a template,
with the cage formed only upon addition of the BF4
 ion to
a mixture of CoII and the ligand.[103] A cage that is formed as
a single diastereoisomer was subsequently prepared by use of
a chiral bridging ligand.[104]
The original system of Ward and co-workers represents an
example of the serendipitous discovery of the anion template
effect. The research group of Custelcean, in collaboration
with the computationalist Hay, prepared a rationally designed
[M4L6]8+ tetrahedral cage templated by a sulfate ion, which it
strongly binds (Kapp  6  106m1; Figure 30).[105] In this exam-
ple, each ligand molecule contains a urea unit, capable of
acting as a bidentate hydrogen-bond donor. These were
calculated—and found by crystallography—to form 12 hydro-
gen bonds to the templating sulfate ion. Avery similar sulfate-
templated cage has also been published by Kaifer and co-
workers.[106]
The resulting topologies of anion-templated metallo-
organic cages are very often unexpected and not simply
limited to tetrahedra. As an illustration, Steel and Sumby
have reported a flat prismatic “disclike” [Ag6L2]6+ cage (L =
hexa(2-pyridyl)[3]radialene), where a fluoride ion is encap-
sulated (Figure 31a).[107] Fluoride is believed to act as
template, due to the encapsulation of the halide ion and the
lack of a discrete fluoride ion in the reagents used to prepare
the cage. More recently, Su and co-workers have found that
a T-shaped pyridyldiphosphine ligand will form “nanotube”-
shaped [Ag6L6]6+ cages in the presence of SbF6
; the
encapsulation of two anions was proved by crystallography
(Figure 31b).[108]
Recent studies on anion-responsive metallo-organic cages
represent one of the most interesting developments in anion
supramolecular chemistry. A discussion on this topic can be
found in Section 6.3.3.

3.4. Anion-Templated Rotaxanes and Catenanes
Two of the most aesthetically pleasing classes of molecules
in chemistry are catenanes and rotaxanes. A catenane is
a compound that consists of two or more rings that are
mechanically interlocked, while a rotaxane consists of one or
more macrocycles threaded over an axle, with bulky stopper
groups on the axle component preventing dethreading. The
first high-yielding syntheses of such species were based on
either a copper(I) cation template[109] or donor–acceptor
aromatic interactions.[110] The first example of an anion-
templated synthesis of a rotaxane was reported by Vçgtle and
co-workers: a phenoxide “half-axle” component, being held
in place by hydrogen bonding to a macrocyclic isophthala-
mide motif, was trapped by an benzylic electrophile stoppered
on one side, with the anionic template being consumed in the
synthesis of the interlocked structure (Figure 32).[111]
Related rotaxanes have since been prepared by Schalley
and co-workers, where a phenolate-containing thread once
again forms a hydrogen bond to an isophthalamide macro-
cycle, but stoppering in this case furnishes the interlocked
structure with the phenolate remaining intact (Figure 33).[112]
In an approach inspired by the copper(I)-templated
method of the Sauvage research group, Beer and co-workers
synthesized interlocked structures by use of a spherical
chloride ion template (Figures 34 and 35).[113] In preparing
the rotaxane[114] and in what was the first example of an anion-
templated catenane[115] species, the chloride ion is held as part
of a tight ion pair with a methylpyridinium diamide motif. The
halide ion
is
coordinatively
unsaturated, which
means
a second, neutral isophthalamide hydrogen-bond-donating
species can associate to create an orthogonal array. This
assembly is supported by supplementary aromatic donor–
acceptor interactions and hydrogen bonding. The use of the
Grubbs ring-closing metathesis catalyst facilitated isolation of
the [2]rotaxane and [2]catenane in 47% and 45% yield,
respectively. The necessity of the chloride ion template is
demonstrated by no interlocked product being observed in
either case when the hexafluorophosphate salt of the
methylpyridinium component is used. By exchanging the
chloride ion for the noncoordinating hexafluorophosphate
ion it was shown that the resulting unique interlocked cavities
selectively bound chloride over more basic oxoanions such as
dihydrogen phosphate and acetate in competitive CDCl3/
CD3OD solvent mixtures.
Very recently, bis(triazole)pyridinium analogues of these
species have been prepared, with both the rotaxane[77] and
catenane[78] showing selectivity for the halides (Cl to I) over
dihydrogen phosphate in CDCl3/CD3OD (1:1). The pyridi-
nium axle motifs have also been exchanged for imidazo-
lium[118] and triazolium[119] in the construction of further
rotaxanes. A rotaxane has also been synthesized where the
axle component—an iodotriazolium—coordinates to the
Figure 31. Further examples of anion-templated metallo-organic cage
formation: a) Steel’s “disclike” [Ag6L2]6+ cage (viewed from above) and
b) Su’s “nanotube” [Ag6L6]6+ cage.

halide ion by means of a halogen bond (Figure 36).[120] The
hexafluorophosphate salt of the iodotriazolium rotaxane
bound the halides in the order I > Br > Cl in CDCl3/
CD3OD/D2O (45:45:10). The authors attributed this trend to
the accessibility of the molecular cavity and the weaker
competition for the more lipophilic halide by the aqueous
solvent media.
Beer and co-workers have also reported upon double
cyclization strategies for preparing doubly charged [2]cate-
nanes. For example, two equivalents of methylpyridinium
precursors were templated by one equivalent of a chloride
ion, which led to catenane formation in a yield of 78%
(Figure 37).[121] Further catenanes have been prepared by
cyclizing pyridinium nicotinamide precursors around sul-
fate[122] and bromoimidazolium precursors around bromide
ions[123] (Figure 38).

The power of a halide ion template is elegantly demon-
strated by the production of exotic structures, including
a
“handcuff”
catenane[124]
and
a
“Janus”
rotaxane[125]
(Figure 39). In both cases, the essential role of the chloride
template was demonstrated by the failure to form the product
when the hexafluorophosphate salts of the pyridinium
precursors were used.
However, Grubbs catalysts are expensive and intolerant
of certain functionalities (e.g. pyridyl). An alternative method
has therefore been developed, where a diamine is reacted
with a bis-acid chloride in the presence of an axle or
macrocycle
to
produce
a
rotaxane[126]
or
catenane[127]
(Figure 40). This method was exploited in the synthesis of
a doubly charged rotaxane (produced by methylation of the
pyridyl rotaxane in Figure 40), which was capable of selec-
tively binding chloride in a 65:35 mixture of [D6]acetone and
D2O.[126b]
A very recent development has been the use of the
pyridine-N-oxide in place of methylpyridinium to synthesize
anion-templated neutral rotaxanes (Figure 41).[128] Here, the
rotaxane was prepared by stoppering a pyridine-N-oxide axle
precursor, threaded through a bis(isophthalamide) macro-
cycle by using the CuAAC reaction. The presence of
a chloride ion was still required for formation of the
interlocked structure. Impressively, the isolated rotaxanes
were capable of binding halides (Cl > Br > I) in CDCl3/
CD3OD/D2O (45:45:10).
Another example of constructing interpenetrated and
interlocked species by using an anion template and neutral
components comes from using indolocarbazole. For example,
an indolocarbazole may thread through an isophthalamide

macrocycle with either fluoride or sulfate ions acting as the
template,[129] and catenanes have been prepared where two
indolocarbazole units coordinate around a chloride ion
(Figure 42).[130]
To date, the anion-templated synthesis of interlocked
molecules has been dominated by the use of spherical halide
(in particular chloride) templates. The Beer research group
has recently disclosed the preparation of a nitrate-templated
rotaxane (Figure 43).[131] By using an axle precursor contain-
ing both methylpyridinium diamide and isophthalamide
motifs, the polyatomic nitrate anion can template the
formation of a pseudorotaxane with an isophthalamide
macrocycle, which may be stoppered by the CuAAC “click”
reaction. Evidence for the templating role of nitrate was
provided by a reduced yield (0–15% compared to 24%) being
observed when other anions (chloride, bicarbonate, dihydro-
gen phosphate, and acetate) were used in place of nitrate in
the reaction. The rotaxane was demonstrated to selectively
recognize nitrate over other singly charged oxoanions (bicar-
bonate, dihydrogen phosphate, and acetate) in CDCl3/
CD3OD/D2O (45:45:10).
3.5. The Optimization and Discovery of Anion-Templated Anion
Receptors by Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry
By its very nature, DCC appears to offer an excellent way
of preparing receptors for specific guests such as anions.[132]
This is illustrated by refinements to the “molecular oysters”
receptors of Kubik and co-workers that have been developed
in collaboration with Otto.[133] In their first report, a molecule
consisting of two identical cyclopeptide macrocycles con-
nected by a single disulfide linker was introduced into a DCL
containing a range of dithiol spacers (Figure 44a). Exchange
of the sulfide bonds allowed for a variety of possible receptors
to be generated. The addition of iodide or sulfate (as their
potassium salts) to the DCL led to specific receptors being
favored and amplified (Figure 44a).[133a] After isolation of
these receptors, the strongest binding affinities were observed
with the receptor depicted in Figure 44b, with association
constants of logKa(I) = 4.75 and logKa(SO4
2) = 6.83 mea-
sured in CH3CN/H2O (2:1), which were an order of magni-

tude greater than for the diamide-linked receptor discussed in
Section 2.1.2. In a second communication, the use of an
alternative library allowed the optimization of a receptor with
two linkers between the macrocycles. In this case, one of the
amplified receptors was able to bind sulfate with logKa = 8.67
(in 2:1 CH3CN/H2O).[133b]
Beeren and Sanders have since taken the use of DCC one
stage further by creating and then investigating novel anion
receptors.[134] A library was constructed containing a disubsti-
tuted ferrocene scaffold (specifically a dihydrazide), with
isophthalaldehyde and 4-methylbenzylhydrazide. The addi-
tion of TBAH2PO4 to the DCL led to magnification of a linear
receptor that in fact binds two H2PO4
 ions (Figure 45).[135]
4. Progress in Anion Sensing
The importance of anions in biology and their environ-
mental impact has meant that ways to selectively detect and
report, that is, sense, the presence of an anionic species, have
been intensively investigated. Indeed, this area of anionic
supramolecular chemistry saw significant early advances
being made, as summarized by Beer and Gale in 2001.[16]
Here, we focus on some of the key developments since that
date.
Molecular sensors for anions may be classified by the
macroscopic response produced upon binding the anion:
electrochemical or optical. Optical anion sensors may be
further classified as either fluorescent or colorimetric. While
fluorescent sensors may be exceptionally sensitive, colori-
metric sensors allow for the possibility of detection by the
human eye.
4.1. Reporter-Spacer-Receptor Anion Sensors
A popular approach to construct an anion sensor is to link
a binding site to a suitable redox-active or optical reporter
group, which may be termed the reporter-spacer-receptor
approach (Figure 46).
4.1.1. Electrochemical Anion Sensors
A range of sensors capable of electrochemically detecting
anions have been constructed by incorporating the redox-
active ferrocene moiety.[136] Anion recognition leads to
a cathodic shift of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox
couple, as measured by cyclic voltammetry. Although the
earliest examples of ferrocene anion sensors were typically
based on secondary amides,[137] the metallocene has subse-
quently been incorporated into a larger number of sensors,
where the anion is bound by a variety of hydrogen-bonding
groups.[138] An impressive recent example is the ferrocenyl-
urea receptor depicted in Figure 47 which is able to electro-
chemically discriminate between enantiomers of chiral car-
boxylate anions in acetonitrile.[139]
Since the turn of the millennium, a number of alternative
redox-active moieties have also been investigated as reporting
groups in electrochemical anion sensors (Figure 48). For
example, Fabbrizzi and co-workers demonstrated that catho-
dic shifts of the CoII/CoIII bipyridyl redox couple are observed
in aqueous acetonitrile electrolyte solutions upon the binding
of anions by the convergent array of imidazolium groups in
a cagelike receptor (Figure 48a).[140] Meanwhile, Beer et al.

have shown that the dithiocarbamate macrocycle depicted in
Figure 48b exhibits a cathodic shift in the CuII/CuIII redox
couple upon the addition of dihydrogen phosphate.[141] Non-
metallic electrochemical anion sensors have also been syn-
thesized. For example, the redox-active tetrathiafulvalene
(TTF) has been fused to a halide-binding calixpyrrole, which
allows for the electrochemical sensing of halide ions in
acetonitrile (Figure 48c).[142]
4.1.2. Optical Anion Sensors
Many fluorescent anion sensors have been constructed by
using the reporter-spacer-receptor approach described above,
with a variety of chemical functionality being used as the
signaling unit. Examples incorporating organic reporter
groups such as anthracene[143] and pyrene,[144] as well as the
transition metal luminescent motif RuII bipyridyl[145] have
continued to be utilized.
An addition to these signaling units has been the
naphthalimide group.[146] The first naphthalimide-containing
anion
sensor
was
described
by
Gunnlaugsson
et al.
(Figure 49).[147] The addition of acetate and dihydrogen
phosphate to this receptor in DMSO leads to a quenching
of fluorescence, as a result of enhanced photoelectron transfer
(PET) from the electron-rich thiourea to the naphthalimide.
Another organic chromophore investigated recently as
a fluorescent signaling unit is 2,6-bis(arylethynyl)pyridine.[148]
Johnson, Haley, and co-workers reported that the receptor in
Figure 50 (once protonated) exhibits an “off to on” fluores-
cence response to added chloride in acetonitrile. Analogous
compounds, where the central pyridine is replaced by
a benzene ring, have also been found to be fluorescently
responsive to anions.[149]
A major aim of anion sensory research has been the
development of systems capable of detecting anionic species
in biological media. Optical reporter groups have tended to
be chosen to maximize sensitivity, while minimizing probe
invasiveness. In addition, direct metal–anion coordination
allows for operation in highly competitive aqueous environ-
ments. Parker and co-workers have used sensitized LnIII
complexes to sense anions both in vitro and in cells, with
the sharp emission bands of the EuIII (and TbIII) cations
allowing for ratiometric analysis, thus avoiding any issues
regarding the concentration of the complex. For example, the
Eu complex in Figure 51a detects citrate in seminal fluid.[150]
The remarkable selectivity of the complex in response to
citrate over the structurally similar lactate anion—both
metabolites which may be found in human fluid media—is
vital. As depleted levels of citrate are a symptom of prostate
cancer, it has been argued that this complex could be used in
cancer screening. Another impressive example has been the
study of bicarbonate concentrations in the mitochrondria of
living cells by use of a mixture of the Eu and Tb complexes of
the same ligand (Figure 51b), which allows for the necessary

ratiometric analysis.[151] Modulation of the Eu emission (by
coordination of bicarbonate) is varied by changing the levels
of CO2 in the cell incubation atmosphere.
4.1.3. Interlocked Structures Capable of Selective Anion Sensing
Beer and co-workers have taken their interlocked mole-
cules capable of selective anion recognition and shown that by
the appendage and incorporation of reporter groups it is
possible to create rotaxanes and catenanes capable of
selective sensory responses to anions.
For example, a [2]rotaxane[152] and a [2]catenane[153] with
an appended ferrocene unit have been prepared by using
a chloride ion template. Their hexafluorophosphate salts
demonstrate the selective electrochemical sensing of chloride
ions in an acetonitrile-based electrolyte (Figure 52). Specif-
ically, the maximum cathodic shift in the Fc/Fc+ redox couple
was observed upon the addition of one equivalent of the
halide ion. With oxoanions, further cathodic shift perturba-
tions were observed upon the addition of excess anion. This
observation was rationalized by considering that only chloride
is capable of penetrating the interlocked cavity, whereas the
polyatomic oxoanions associate at the cavitys periphery.
Luminescent rotaxanes incorporating a 4,4’-diamide-2,2’-
bipyridyl macrocycle to allow for complexation of ReI and
RuII ions have also been reported (Figure 53).[154] The
addition of chloride and dihydrogen phosphate to samples
of the metalated rotaxanes dissolved in aqueous acetone
(containing up to 30% H2O) led to enhancement of the
metal–ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) luminescence. The
trend in calculated association constants—chloride being
bound more strongly than dihydrogen phosphate—was in
agreement with that obtained from 1H NMR titrations.
In collaboration with Faulkner, Beer and co-workers have
also reported a lanthanide-appended rotaxane that responds
to changing chloride concentration (Figure 54).[155] The lumi-
nescence behavior is modulated by the binding of the chloride
ion first to the ninth coordination site of the EuIII cation,
which leads to quenching of the lanthanide emission. This is
subsequently restored upon binding of the second equivalent
of chloride within the rotaxane cavity.
The ability of higher order interlocked structures to
provide alternative modes of sensory selectivity is demon-
strated by ferrocene-[156] and naphthalene-functionalized[157]
[3]rotaxanes (Figure 55). The Fc/Fc+ redox couple of the
ferrocene rotaxane (Figure 55a) undergoes a cathodic shift
upon the addition of up to two equivalents of chloride,
consistent with binding of the halide ion within the two
interlocked cavities. The addition of sulfate to the free host
led to complex, but different, electrochemical behavior;
1H NMR titrations indicated that the neutral rotaxane binds
the dianion in a 1:1 stoichiometry. For the naphthalene

rotaxane (Figure 55b), the addition of chloride, bromide, and
acetate simply led to a modest enhancement of the naphtha-
lene emission. In the case of sulfate, a dramatic quenching was
initially observed before restoration and enhancement. This
result is attributed to the polyatomic sulfate dianion first
coordinating between the two pyridinium units (in a 1:1
binding mode) close to the naphthalene moiety, and then
coordinating to each pyridinium moiety separately (in a 2:1
binding mode) and being hence further away from the
fluorescent moiety.
B. D. Smith et al. have reported the use of squaraine
rotaxane shuttles as reversible optical sensors for chloride
ions (Figure 56). In the first report,[158] they demonstrated that
the addition of chloride resulted in the tetralactam macro-
cycle of the rotaxane being displaced, thereby leading to
a threefold increase in the deep-red fluorescence emission
from the squaraine dye. Removal of the chloride, led to
a complete reversal of this process. Prototype dipsticks were
prepared (by adsorption of the rotaxane onto reverse-phase
silica), which were able to detect chloride ions in aqueous
solution. Very recently, an improved shuttle has been
reported.[159] Not only containing a more stable dihydroxy-
substituted dye, the rotaxane was able to sense anions
ratiometrically as a result of anion binding modulating the
emission wavelength, rather than changing the emission
intensity.
4.2. Indicator-Displacement Assays for Anions
An alternative design for optical anion sensors is the use
of indicator-displacement assays (IDAs). Here, an indicator is
bound weakly by the receptor, so that it is displaced upon
addition of guest, thereby giving
either a colorimetric or fluorescence
response (Figure 57). One of the
principal
advantages
of
this
approach is the possibility of using
different indicators with the same
receptor.[160]
The pioneering work on indica-
tor-displacement assays for anions
was
reported
by
Metzger
and
Anslyn just before the start of the
new
millennium.
For
example,
a
1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-triethyl-
benzene scaffold containing three
guanidinium groups was shown to
selectively sense the levels of citrate
in commercially available soft drinks
by using 5-carboxyfluorescein as an
indicator
(Figure 58).[161]
Anslyn’s
research group has also reported
a polyguanidinium-appended scaf-
fold that fluorescently sensed inosi-
tol triphosphate in methanol[162] and
an assay that colorimetrically sensed
heparin.[163]

allows for the facile generation of

assays that may operate in aqueous solvent media. Fabbrizzi
et al. reported upon a dicopper cage that could selectively
detect (by fluorescence) bicarbonate in water, by displace-
ment of a coumarine indicator (Figure 59).[164]
4.3. Anion Chemodosimeters
Chemodosimeters are examples of a third class of anion
sensor, which typically provide a colorimetric response
(Figure 60). The anion may either form a covalent bond to
the receptor, thus causing, for example, a change in the color
of the molecule or, alternatively, the anion might catalyze
a chemical transformation of the receptor molecule. Consid-
ering the irreversible change in the constitution of the
“receptor”, it is arguable whether chemodosimeters are
genuinely supramolecular in nature. For completeness, we
provide select examples here to give a flavor of the field.
Two reports of anion chemodosimeters from the research
group of Martnez-MÇez are presented in Figure 61. In the
first, the cyclization of a yellow pent-2-en-1,5-dione to the
magenta pyrylium allowed for discrimination between the
olefinic isomers maleate and fumarate, as the cis isomer
maleate is able to form strong hydrogen bonds to the enol
group (significantly enhancing the electron density on the
oxygen atom), thereby allowing for accelerated cyclization
(Figure 61a).[165] In a second paper, the pyrylium product has
been shown to undergo a ring opening followed by a ring
closing to form a thiopyrylium upon the addition of the sulfide
anion, which is marked by a change in color from magenta to
blue (Figure 61b). Impressive selectivity over a wide range of
anions was reported.[166]
The cyanide ion is a very common target for detection by
chemodosimeters, as its high nucleophilicity allows for the
design of receptors that will selectively react with this
particular anion. For
example, Sessler and co-workers
reported a colorimetric sensor for cyanide based on a benzil
analogue (Figure 62). Solutions of the chemodosimeter in

a 70:30 mixture of MeOH and H2O are yellow, but the
addition of low concentrations of cyanide results in the
solution becoming colorless, with a high selectivity across
a range of anions tested.[167]
Hudnall and Gabba have prepared an ammonium borane
which is also highly selective for cyanide (Figure 63).[168] In the
highly competitive 60:40 mixture of H2O and DMSO, cyanide
is bound with Ka = 3.9  108m1, while a wide range of halides
(including fluoride) and oxoanions exhibit no binding, as
evident by monitoring the UV/Vis absorbance of the recep-
tor. In a further experiment it was found that the fluorescence
of a 5 mm sample of the receptor is quenched by 1 equivalent
of cyanide in a 90:10 mixture of H2O in MeOH.
Fluoride is another nucleophilic anion that is commonly
sensed by chemodosimetric methods. In particular, a vast
number of receptors have been prepared which exploit the
formation of BF[169] and SiF bonds (Figure 64). For
example, the diboron naphthalene compound is capable of
binding fluoride in a bidentate fashion with an exceptionally
high association constant of 5  109m1 in THFand a change in
color from yellow to colorless.[170] The addition of two
equivalents of fluoride to the ferrocene diboronate under
aerobic conditions leads to a color change from orange to pale
green, as a result of the fluoride inducing the in situ oxidation
of ferrocene to ferrocenium.[171] In the case of the trianthryl-
silane, an enhancement in fluorescence occurs because of
alteration of the through-space interactions between the three
anthracene moieties upon binding of fluoride (in THF) to the
central silicon atom.[172]
4.4. Surface-Attached Anion Sensors
Research into anion sensors has traditionally focused on
the design and synthesis of solution-based receptors equipped
with appropriate reporter groups. However, receptors at-
tached to surfaces as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) can
exhibit a number of advantages over their solution-phase
analogues.[173] First, the receptor is typically more preorgan-
ized on a surface, which may lead to amplification of a sensory
response. Second, there is the possibility of recycling a sur-
face-attached sensor, and third, by immobilizing a receptor to
a surface, it is possible to use a water-insoluble receptor in
aqueous conditions.
4.4.1. Surface-Attached Anion Sensors with Reporter Groups
The redox-active ferrocene motif has been used in
a number of surface-confined anion sensors. The first example
was demonstrated by Astruc and co-workers, where a simple
amidoferrocenyl alkylthiolate was adsorbed onto a gold
electrode surface, and a large cathodic shift of the Fc/Fc+
redox couple was observed upon the addition of dihydrogen
phosphate.[174] The same research group has also attached
amidoferrocenyl alkanethiols to gold nanoparticles, by con-
structing mixed monolayers of the ferrocene-containing thiol
and dodecanethiol.[175] Beer et al. have since demonstrated
that immobilization of ferrocene-containing anion receptors
to gold surfaces leads to amplification of the electrochemical
response (Figure 65a,b).[176] For example, the ferrocene
diamide SAM (Figure 65a) exhibits a 100 mV cathodic
shift in the Fc/Fc+ redox couple upon addition of chloride,
compared to a 40 mV cathodic shift for the receptor

and
co-workers
have
reported upon a TTF-calixpyrrole chloride
sensor
adsorbed
onto
a
gold
surface
(Figure 66).[177] In this case, the chloride-
induced cathodic shift of the first oxidation
wave of the TTF group in dichloromethane
was significantly less than that of the
solution-based analogue. This was attrib-
uted by the authors to the surface-confined
receptor being sterically inhibited from
undergoing rearrangement from its ground
state 1,3-alternate conformation to the
cone conformation that calix[4]pyrroles
adopt when binding chloride ions in solu-
tion.
Sophisticated
redox-active
chloride
sensors based on rotaxane SAMs have
been prepared by Beer, Davis, and co-
workers.[178,179] In the first reported system,
a ferrocene-appended macrocycle was confined to a surface
as part of a rotaxane by use of a thiotic acid appended
pentaphenylferrocene-stoppered axle (Figure 67).[178] Upon
removal of the chloride template, the rotaxane was able to
sense chloride in electrolytic acetonitrile solutions through
a cathodic shift in the Fc/Fc+ redox wave. Excellent selectivity
in sensing was observed: with chloride being sensed in the
presence of a 100-fold excess of dihydrogen phosphate.
Very recently, an osmium-bipyridyl macrocycle has been
incorporated as part of a rotaxane SAM (Figure 68).[179] As
before, removal of the chloride template allows for electro-
chemical sensing of chloride in electrolytic acetonitrile
solutions, this time by a cathodic shift in the OsII/OsIII-
bipyridyl redox wave.
Beer, Davis et al. have also reported an optical surface-
attached anion sensor consisting of zinc(II) metalloporphyr-
ins assembled onto gold nanoparticles (Figure 69).[180] These
were able to bind chloride and dihydrogen phosphate in
dichloromethane and DMSO, as measured by UV/Vis titra-
tion experiments, with higher affinities than when the metal-
loporphyrins were free in solution.
Gunnlaugsson and co-workers have prepared lanthanide
complexes on gold nanoparticles for luminescent sensing of
phosphate ions in aqueous solution (Figure 70).[181] The
sensing of coordinating anions such as carboxylates and
phosphates occurs by the switching off of the EuIII emission by
displacement of the b-diketone ligand, which acts as an
“antenna” for the LnIII ion. Phosphate-containing molecules
such as AMP, ADP, ATP, cyclic AMP, or NADP were found to
quench the luminescence to a greater degree over other
anions. However, complete quenching was only observed with
flavin monophosphate.

4.4.2. Surface-Attached Anion Sensors Based on Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a tech-
nique which allows for the fabrication of a well-established
(anion) binding motif onto a suitable surface without need to
include a reporter group. The specific quantity measured in an
experiment is the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of a mono-
layer, which is carried out in the presence of a suitable redox-
active couple, which may be a redox-active metal complex or
organic molecule. If an anionic guest is bound, a build-up of
negative charge occurs in the monolayer, which (for example)
repels a negatively charged redox probe, this being detected
as an increase in the Rct value.
For example, Zhang and Echegoyen reported upon
a trisamide cyclotriveratrylene attached to gold electrodes
that could signal the binding of acetate in aqueous solution by
EIS (Figure 72).[183] When [Fe(CN)6]3/[Fe(CN)6]4 was used
as the redox probe, a dramatic increase in the Rct value was
observed upon addition of acetate, whereas a decrease was
observed when [Ru(NH3)6]3+/[Ru(NH3)6]2+ was used. These
SAMs proved to be selective for acetate, with the less basic
halides not being detected. Selectivity for fluoride was found
in a similar system, based on a calix[6]crown-4 scaffold.[184] In
both these systems the surface-confined sensor mirrored the
anion-binding properties of solution-phase analogues.
4.5. Detection of Multiple Anions: Sensor Arrays and Pattern
Recognition
Many simple anion sensors are promiscuous, being
capable of responding to a range of anions, and so will only
be useful as a sensor for a particular anionic species in
isolation. Typical “real-world” environmental and biological
samples will not conform to this limitation. Even if a sensor is

able to operate in the presence of other anions, it may be of
interest to sense more than one (perhaps even all) of the
anions in a sample.
A supramolecular chemistry approach to overcome these
issues is to employ a sensor array.[185] This has been
demonstrated by Anzenbacher and co-workers, who used
eight hydrogen-bond-donating colorimetric sensors (six cal-
ixpyrroles, one N-confused calixpyrrole, and one anthraqui-
none; Figure 73) embedded in a polyurethane hydrogel that
enabled the differentiation of ten inorganic anions.[186] The
eight sensors were carefully chosen on the basis of their anion
association constants determined in organic solvents (the
hydrogel desolvates the anions present in the aqueous sample,
thus allowing the neutral receptors to function). The colori-
metric responses of the array to anions were recorded using
an electronic scanner, which facilitated the necessary compu-
tational calculations. An application was demonstrated by
analyzing several commercial toothpaste brands, which could
be differentiated by the quantity of fluoride and other anions
present. In the same year, Anzenbacher and co-workers also
described a sensor array for detecting phosphate ions in
human serum by using eight different (tripodal hydrogen-
bond-donating) sensor molecules.[187]
A notable recent example of a ratiometric indicator-
displacement assay array capable of colorimetrically distin-
guishing between ten anions in water has been reported by
Feng, Guan et al.[188] The principle behind each IDA used is
that a colorimetric indicator chelates a metal cation. Expo-
sure to an anion may lead to the cation being removed from
the indicator–cation complex. This event then produces
a colorimetric response from the uncomplexed indicator.
Nine chelating indicators and eight metal cations were used to
construct the 3  6 array, which could analyze anions in “real-
world” samples, for example, drinking water or discharged
waste streams.
5. Anion Transportation
5.1. Introduction
The investigation of synthetic anion transportation is
inspired by the knowledge that a number of diseases are
caused by the misregulation of anionic species across the
phospholipid bilayers of cell membranes. The most well-
known of these is the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis (CF),
caused by the dysfunction of the CFTR anion channel in
epithelial cell membranes, which impairs the flux of chloride
and bicarbonate anions.[1] In addition, it is known that
prodigiosins, a family of small naturally occurring molecules
capable of anion binding, possess a range of biological
activity, including antibiotic, immunosuppressive, and anti-
tumor behavior.[189]
In recent times, most studies on anion transportation have
used unilamellar vesicles composed of a lipid or a mixture of
lipid and cholesterol to simulate the phospholipid bilayers of
cell membranes. Anion efflux, as affected by added trans-
porter molecules, may be monitored by use of a) ion-selective
electrodes (ISEs), b) encapsulated fluorescent dyes capable
of detecting changes in the pH value or anion concentration,
and c) NMR spectroscopy. However, real cells have been, and
are increasingly, being used in conjunction with whole cell
patch clamp or Ussing chamber techniques. For accessible
discussions of these experimental methods we refer interested
readers to specialist reviews.[190]
Ion transport may be classified by the direction of travel of
the ionic species. A uniport mechanism is where a single type
of ion is transported, with no other processes occurring at the
same time. This process is, therefore, accompanied by the
build-up of an electrostatic potential across the membrane.
Antiport involves the transport of a species in one direction,
with the transport of a second species in the opposite
direction. In the case of two anions this will avoid the
accumulation of an electrostatic potential. The same effect
may be achieved by symport (or cotransport), where two
species, specifically a cation and an anion, are transported in
the same direction. Strictly, this is ion-pair transportation, but
we will cover examples for completeness in the next section.
Here we choose to discuss research on anion transporta-
tion based primarily on whether the transporter is either a) a

mobile carrier (molecules that bind and “chaperone” the
ion(s) across the bilayer) or b) an anion channel (where
molecules are large enough alone, or by aggregation, to span
a bilayer).
5.2. Mobile Anion Carriers—“Anionophores”
The design of successful mobile anion carriers, which may
be termed anionophores, typically arise from examples of
anion receptors.[191] Although the ability to bind the anion
guest is essential, another important property to be consid-
ered is the lipophilicity of the carrier, as anion transport will
occur across a lipophilic medium.
In one of the most established programs on anionophore
research, A. P. Davis and co-workers have reported upon the
use of derivatives of cholic acid, which possess both hydrogen-
bond-donating urea groups and a lipophilic steroid skeleton
that can shield a complexed anion (Figure 74).[192] In their first
studies (in collaboration with B. D. Smith), efflux of chloride
ions was monitored by use of an ISE and
35Cl NMR
spectroscopy.[193] The strongest binders of chloride were
found to be the best transporters of the anion across
unilamellar vesicles. In the same report, they used an
Ussing chamber to demonstrate that chloride transport was
possible across live epithelia, as detected by the creation of
a potential difference across the cellular membrane.
A greater range of studies have been subsequently been
undertaken, typically incorporating the transporter within
synthetic vesicles, and using the fluorescent dye lucigenin to
monitor influx of chloride. Interesting results from these
investigations include the presence of a positive charge having
a deleterious effect on transport,[194] while a cyclic “chola-
phane” (Figure 75a) was shown to be a more active trans-
porter.[195] Although a modestly stronger anion binder, the
authors attribute the greater transport activity of the chol-
aphane to the increased shielding of the anion from the
solvent. More recently, the same research group has reported
the simplification of the structure from a steroid scaffold to
a trans-decalin, while retaining high levels of transport
activity (Figure 75b).[196] The potentially pharmacologically
useful features of this trans-decalin structure are its lower
lipophilicity (more likely to be deliverable through aqueous
environments in vivo) and reduced molecular weight (more
“druglike”).
There is a considerable body of work describing molecules
capable of acting as symportic transporters of the H+/Cl ion
pair. For example, Sessler et al. studied the efflux of chloride
across synthetic membranes by synthetic prodigiosins and
dipyrromethenes
using
an
ISE
(Figure 76a).[197]
A
pH
dependency, consistent with HCl symport was observed.
The research groups of Gale and B. D. Smith have inves-
tigated a number of simple prodigiosin mimics, including
examples containing pyrrole[198] or 2,6-pyridinedicarboxa-
mide[199] appended with a methylimidazole that could act as
a site of protonation (Figure 76b). Chloride transport from
vesicles was observed in the presence of a suitable pH
gradient, with analogues lacking a protonable site being found
to be transport-inactive.
Systems incorporating the tri(2-aminoethyl)amine (tren)
functional group have also been studied, as the tertiary amino
group may be protonated, while the facile incorporation of
hydrogen-bond donors (e.g. amides) allows for chloride
complexation. For example, D. K. Smith and co-workers
reported triamide-tren molecules were able to transport H+/
Cl,[200] while Berezin and Davis described an analogous
dicatechol (Figure 77).[201] In the latter case, the presence and
specific substitution pattern of the catechol appeared to be
crucial, for neither the tetramethylated phenol analogue nor
the 3,4-isomer were able to transport anions.

Attention has also been paid to the transportation of the
bicarbonate ion across bilayers, with a key seminal report on
this topic being made by J. T. Davis, Gale, Quesada et al.[202]
By studying a selection of natural and synthetic anionophores
by use of ISEs and 13C NMR spectroscopy, they verified that
Cl/HCO3
 antiport was possible across synthetic mem-
branes. Notably, natural prodigiosins were found to be more
effective transporters than the synthetic isophthalamides
investigated. Quesada and co-workers have since studied
synthetic prodiginines, and shown that the anticancer drug
candidate Obatoclax (Figure 78a), was a highly active anio-
nophore able to facilitate chloride/bicarbonate antiport. It
was also shown to acidify a GLC4 cell line, and hence have
considerable cytotoxic character.[203] Similar behavior was
observed in the related, but structurally simpler, tambjamine
alkaloids (Figure 78b).[204] Meanwhile, Gale and co-workers
have reported that tripodal tri(thio)ureas are capable of Cl/
HCO3
 antiport across synthetic membranes (Figure 78c).
Notably, the triurea analogues exhibit much lower (if any)
transport ability.[205] More recently, the same research group
has demonstrated that squaramides can facilitate antiport
chloride ion transportation, including Cl/HCO3
 exchange
(Figure 78d). In this report, the squaramides were found to be
better transporters than analogous thioureas and ureas.[206]
This interest in the transportation of other biologically
relevant anions is a developing research theme. Gale and co-
workers have reported that ortho-phenylenediamine-based
ureas are capable of the antiport transportation of maleate
and fumarate (Figure 79a).[207] The same research group has
also disclosed that thioureas can act as antiport transporters
of lactate and pyruvate (Figure 79b,c).[208] In this case,
variation in the transporter structure led to a change in the
selectivity of the transportation efficiency; the simpler
thiourea-indole (Figure 79b) transported pyruvate more
effectively, while the inclusion of an amide (Figure 79c) led
to a transporter with greater efficiency for lactate—the
authors proposed the presence of an additional hydrogen
bond between the receptor and lactate could explain this
observation.
Sulfate is a highly hydrophilic anion (in part because of its
double negative charge), and hence is hugely challenging to
transport across a lipophilic membrane. Gale, Jolliffe, Plavec,
and co-workers have very recently used 33S NMR spectros-
copy to demonstrate direct evidence of sulfate transportation
with tri(thio)ureas based on tren or cyclopeptide scaffolds.[209]
Specifically,
33S-labeled sulfate, in conjunction with para-
magnetic Mn2+ and Fe3+ ions, allowed for the discrimination
of intra- and extravesicular sulfate. By using this technique it
was shown that the cyclopeptide cage in Figure 80, could
facilitate
not
only
Cl/SO4

and
HCO3

antiport,
but

Hydrogen bonding has been all but
ubiquitous in the anionophores de-
scribed to date. However, calix[4]ar-
enes that can bind and transport anions
by anion–p interactions (Figure 81a)
or halogen bonding (Figure 81b) have
been prepared by Matile and co-work-
ers.[210] In a more recent communica-
tion, the ability of simple, commer-

com-
pounds to transport anions, by utilizing
halogen bonding, has been reported by

5.3. Anion Channels
Considering that nature employs channels to transport
anions, it is unsurprising that there has been research into the
development of synthetic analogues. Here we provide a few
illustrative examples; for further discussions we refer inter-
ested readers to specialist reviews.[190]
Tomich and co-workers have been pursuing the prepara-
tion of chloride ion transporting channels for some consid-
erable time.[212] Basing their work on the natural spinal cord
glycine receptor ion channel, 22-amino acid residue peptides
have been synthesized, and found to be selective for chloride,
as tested by the planar lipid bilayer method. Gokel and co-
workers have reported the use of shorter amphiphilic
heptapeptides, which form anion channels upon dimerizing
in a bilayer (Figure 82).[213] This research group has been able
to optimize features (e.g. the lipophilic N and C termini and
the actual amino acid sequence) of the peptides to maximize
the efficiency of chloride transport.[214] Specific examples
were also demonstrated (by Ussing chamber experiments) to
effect anion transport in epithelial cells.[215]
Relatively small molecules may act as anion channels. For
example, J. T. Davis and co-workers have used voltage-clamp
experiments to demonstrate that a 1,3-alternate tetrabutyla-
mide calix[4]arene could assemble into channels for the
transport of the H+/Cl ion pair (Figure 83).[216] Subsequently,
the same research group have reported upon calix[4]arenes
existing in partial cone[217] and cone[218]
conformations that also form ion chan-
nels and permit the transfer of the same
ion pair.
Matile and co-workers have been
working on anion–p slides.[76] In the
archetypal example, rigid, membrane-
spanning,
p-oligo-(p-phenylene)-N,N-
naphthalenediimide
rods
transport
chloride across a bilayer by anion–p
interactions
(Figure 84).[219]
More
recently,
perylenediimide
analogues
have also been shown to facilitate
anion transport.[220]
6. Future Directions: Applications of Anion Supra-
molecular Chemistry
Here attention is turned to examples of functional
applications of anion supramolecular chemistry. Some of
these research themes have already reached remarkably high
levels of research output, whilst others, in comparison, are
somewhat underexplored.
6.1. Anions in Catalysis
6.1.1. Anion Recognition in Asymmetric
Organic Catalysis by Using Neutral
Hydrogen-Bond Donors
The use of molecules with hydro-
gen-bond-donating groups as catalysts
of asymmetric organic chemical trans-
formations represents an elegant dem-
onstration of how knowledge of anion
recognition may be applied to a chem-
ical application. This area has attracted
huge amounts of research interest, and
we emphasize that what follows merely
represents a few highlights from a large
number of examples which may be
found in the literature.[221]
For example, Jacobsen and co-
workers reported upon a thiourea-cat-
alyzed enantioselective Pictet–Spen-
gler
cyclization
(Figure 85).[222]
The
proposed reaction mechanism has the
chiral thiourea catalyst hydrogen bond-
ing to the chloride counterion of the
charged electrophile, thus allowing chiral information to be
transferred from the thiourea to the cyclizing molecule.
Further reactions where chloride[223] and, alternatively, bro-
mide[224] and fluoride[225] ions are bound by chiral thiourea
catalysts have been reported by the same research group.
In a recent study Ooi and co-workers have disclosed that
chiral 1,2,3-triazolium compounds can act as cationic organo-
catalysts
in
the
asymmetric
alkylation
of
oxindoles
(Figure 86). Optimization of the catalyst structure and solvent
allowed for almost quantitative yields and enantiomeric
excesses of up to 97%.[226]
6.1.2. Chiral Anions as Catalysts in Organic Chemistry
Another highly investigated research theme based on
anions in catalytic reactions has been the deployment of chiral
anions to achieve stereoselective organic transformations.[227]
In the majority of cases, these have been axially chiral

binaphthyl phosphate ions. For example, Mayer and List
reported upon the transfer hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated
aldehydes using dihydropyridine and 20 mol% of an ammo-
nium binaphthyl phosphate salt, with enantiomer excesses
> 98% being observed (Figure 87).[228] Xiao and co-workers
have subsequently demonstrated that an IrIII-catalyzed imine
hydrogenation could similarly operate at high levels of
enantioselectivity if binaphthyl phosphates were used as
counterions to the cationic IrIII organometallic fragment.[229]
Toste and co-workers have also described the use of
a chiral binaphthylphosphate ion to mediate the asymmetric
ring opening of meso-aziridinium and episulfonium ions
(Figure 88).[230]
The
positively
charged
three-membered
rings that are formed in the first stages of the reaction
associate with the chiral anion, thus directing the attack of the
incoming nucleophilic alcohol and affords enantiomeric
excesses > 90%.
In contrast, the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes
with a MnIII salen complex reported by Liao and List involves
coordination of the chiral anion with the catalytic reagent,
rather than the reaction substrate (Figure 89).[231] After
thorough screening, almost quantitative yields and enantio-
meric excesses of up to 96% were achieved.
In a notable departure, Reek and co-workers have
investigated the use of chiral carboxylate anions as cofactors
in enantioselective catalysis.[232] Specifically, they studied
a diphosphine-rhodium complex that contained a di(amido-
diindolyl)methane hydrogen-bond-donor array in the ligand
structure. Addition of a chiral carboxylate allows for forma-
tion a chiral complex (in dichloromethane), which induces
enantioselective hydrogenation (Figure 90).

synthetic method to prepare Au@Pd and Pt@Pd core@shell
nanoparticles.[233] First, core nanoparticles are prepared using
stabilizing
ligands
containing
hydrogen-bond-donating
amides. Then, the shell metal is introduced, in an oxidized
form, as part of an anionic [MCl4]n complex which is bound
by the hydrogen-bond-donating amides (Figure 91). To com-
plete the synthesis, the metal is reduced, thereby yielding the
core@shell nanoparticles. The Au@Pd nanoparticles synthe-
sized by this method were shown to be highly efficient in
catalyzing the industrially useful conversion of chloronitro-
benzene into chloroaniline.
6.2 Anionic Extraction
As stated in the Introduction, a key motivation for
investigating anion recognition is the capture and removal
of certain anionic pollutants, often resulting from anthropo-
genic activities, from the natural environment. An excellent
demonstration of anionic extraction is provided by Custel-
cean and co-workers, who have been able to separate sulfate
from simulated nuclear waste. The key challenges they faced
included the strong hydration of the dianion, the presence of
various competing anions, and extreme alkalinity (pH > 14).
However, a remarkably simple tren-triurea (Figure 92a) can
extract sulfate from simulated nuclear waste by crystalliza-
tion.[234] One equivalent of sulfate ions is bound by hydrogen
bonds from two tren-triurea ligand molecules that encapsu-
late their oxoanion guest (as evidenced by crystallographic
structure determination), with sodium ions acting as the
necessary counterions.
Similar tren-triurea molecules have also been employed
by Tasker, Schrçder, and co-workers in the extraction and
transport of the [PtCl6]2 ion (Figure 92b).[235] The industrial
isolation of Pt cannot utilize inner-sphere coordination
complexes because of the very slow ligand exchange kinetics
of the PtIV cation, and so outer-sphere coordination complex-
ation is required to form neutral anion–ligand systems. As in
the case of the sulfate system developed by Custelcean and
co-workers, one equivalent of [PtCl6]2 ion is bound by two
tren ligands, but the tren ligands are protonated, and
crystallographical
structure
determination
indicates
that
only two of the tren “arms” participate in hydrogen bonding
with any given anion. The authors were able to demonstrate
that this system was able to recover PtIV from acidic chloride
feed solutions.
6.3. Anion-Responsive Materials and Molecules
The
generation
of
systems
which
respond
through
a change in a property that is beyond a perturbation leading
simply to an optical or electrochemical sensory response is
a key area of investigation in supramolecular chemistry today.
With their wide variety of geometries, anions offer possibil-
ities which can complement those offered by other classes of
chemical or physical stimuli. Although significant progress
has been made in developing anion-responsive materials and
molecules, this area of research is still in its infancy and has
much potential for future development.
6.3.1. Anion-Responsive Gels and Liquid Crystals
A gel is a semi-solid colloidal system, consisting of
a fibrous solid network and a solvent that is retained within
this solid “structure”. A gel will remain in the vessel in which
it is residing upon inversion of the vessel; however, upon
heating it may pass through a phase transition, equivalent to
the melting of a solid, at a temperature denoted Tgel.

ized core nanoparticles.

Molecules containing neutral hydrogen-bond donors and
acceptors, for example ureas, may form gels provided the
solvent is not too competitive to prevent hydrogen bonding.
Anions may be added that compete as hydrogen-bond
acceptors, hence disrupting the network and lowering Tgel.[236]
For example, Steed and co-workers have reported a set of
diureas (n = 2, 4, 6, 8; Figure 93) that act as gelators in
chloroform.[237] The addition of strongly binding anions—such
as acetate—reduces the gel strength, and in one case (n = 2)
disrupts gel formation completely. Importantly, a practical use
of this phenomenon has been found in the growth of crystals
of pharmaceutical molecules.[238] Historically, this application
has used hydrogels, which typically require harsh conditions
to disrupt the gel phase, which may dissolve the crystals being
obtained. The addition of acetate triggers destruction of
diurea gelators similar in structure to those shown in
Figure 93, thus allowing for easy isolation of the desired
crystal.
Anion-triggered hydrogelators have also been reported.
For example, Mocerino and Ogden described a proline-
functionalized
calix[4]arene
(Figure 94a)
which
formed
hydrogels in the presence of specific anions; the effect the
anion had on gel stability was attributed to the Hofmeister
series.[239] Zhang and co-workers demonstrated that proton-
ated melamine will form gels in water with oxoanions such as
nitrate, phosphate, sulfate, and ATP (Figure 94b).[240] In both
cases, gelation can be switched off by increasing the pH value,
which leads to deprotonation of the gelator and loss of the
positive charge required to interact with the anion in the
competitive aqueous solvent.
Anions have also been used to affect the supramolecular
structures of liquid crystals. Kim and co-workers incorporated
a guanidinium motif onto the apex of a mesogen to allow
interaction of an anion with the
molecule (Figure 95).[241] The result-
ing
cation
forms
supramolecular
structures that depend upon the
nature of the counterion: hexagonal
columnar with nitrate or tetrafluor-
oborate, rectangular columnar with
HCCCO2
, while a cubic mesophase
is observed with chloride. Notably
the deprotonated guanidine is not
a liquid crystal, but does form a gel
phase in dodecane.
6.3.2. Anion-Responsive Complexes and Molecules
The effect of anions on the structures and conformational
behaviors of single chemical species has also been docu-
mented. For example, Yam and co-workers have reported the
anion-assisted trans-cis isomerization of a PdII-phosphine
complex (Figure 96).[242] Both phosphine ligands contain an
acetanilide functionality, which can form a convergent hydro-
gen-bonding cleft to an appropriate anion only when cis to
one another. Hence, in chloroform, the addition of chloride or
triflate results in trans-cis isomerization, which may be
reversed by the addition of DMSO.
Jones and Hamilton have documented the ability of halide
ions to control the conformation of hydrogen-bonded diphe-
nylacetylenes.[243] In chloroform, the free diphenylacetylene

derivative (Figure 97) exists mainly (ca. 9:1) in the confor-
mation where the ester carbonyl group can hydrogen bond to
one of the NH groups of the acidic urea functionality. A
halide ion will bind in preference to the urea, so the addition
of chloride results in the phenylacetylene rotating, to allow
the ester C=O group to hydrogen bond to the amide NH
group instead.
A principal incentive for the preparation of interlocked
architectures is the potential for such molecules to exhibit
relative motion of their constituent parts. In recent times, it
has been shown that this may be achieved by use of anionic
stimuli. For example, Beer and co-workers have reported
a pH-switchable catenane (Figure 98).[244] Synthesized by
using a chloride ion template and then exchanged to the
hexafluorophosphate salt, the catenane contains a phenol
which may be deprotonated to generate a phenoxide moiety.
The catenane undergoes ring rotation so that the phenolate
anion is bound by the pyridinium isophthalamide motif.
Reprotonation reverses the process, driven by favorable
aromatic donor–acceptor interactions of the electron-poor
pyridinium ring with the electron-rich hydroquinones. A pH-
switchable phenol-containing rotaxane shuttle has also been
reported by Keaveney and Leigh.[245]
Alternatively, the switching of the counterion of a pos-
itively charged interlocked molecule may induce molecular
motion. For example, Leigh and co-workers synthesized the
chloride salt of a rotaxane (Figure 99), where the macrocyclic
component initially resides over a pyridinium ring in the axle,
as a consequence of electrostatic attraction between the
positively charged pyridinium ring and a negatively charged
chloride ion coordinated to a PdII cation bound by the
macrocycle.[246] Exchange of chloride for the noncoordinating
hexafluorophosphate, leaves the PdII cation coordinatively
unsaturated and induces shuttling to the Lewis basic nitrogen
atom of the triazole. Reintroduction of chloride returns the
macrocycle to its original position. Other rotaxane shuttles,
switchable by Cl/PF6
 metathesis, have also been reported by
the research groups of Beer[247] and Chiu.[248]
A neutral rotaxane, switchable by the addition and
removal of acetate, has been reported by Chiu and co-
workers (Figure 100).[249] In CDCl3/CD3CN (1:1), the axle of
the rotaxane resides with the urea C=O group hydrogen
bonding to the 2,6-pyridyldiamide moiety of the macrocycle.
In the presence of acetate, the urea NH groups hydrogen

and hydrogen bond to the ester C=O group instead.
We note that appropriately designed switchable inter-
locked molecules have been shown to act as anion sensors.
Examples of rotaxane shuttles that provide an optical sensory
response to chloride have been reported recently by the
research groups of B. D. Smith (see Section 4.1.3)[158,159] and
Beer.[250]
6.3.3. Anion-Responsive Transition-Metallo-Organic Cages
Whereas metal-templated organic cages that can act as
anion receptors are known,[251] examples that are responsive
to anionic stimuli, either by reconstitution of the cage or by
disturbing an equilibrium of isomers, have only been reported
very recently.
Nitschke and co-workers have described that the reaction
of p-toluidine, 6,6’-diformyl-3,3’-bipyridine, and Co(OTf)2
produces a [Co4L6]8+ tetrahedron, where each ligand L is
a di(imine)bipyridyl moiety (Figure 101).[252] The addition of
LiClO4 leads to a structural reconstitution to create a barrel-
like [Co10L15]20+ pentagonal prism, which binds chloride
within its structure with an affinity K > 6  105m1. The same
research group has also reported an alternative system, where
4,4’-diaminobiphenyl, 2-formylpyridine, and a FeII salt are
allowed to react. This reaction leads to a [Fe4L6]8+ tetrahedral
cage, which exists as a system of interconverting diastereo-
mers in solution. The addition of anionic guests leads to new
combinations of diastereomers, which are able to rotate their
bonds to adapt to the particular anion added.[253]
Chifotides, Dunbar, and co-workers have studied the
conversion of FeII di(pyridyl)tetrazine cages with p-acidic
cavities by exchange of the anion encapsulated within the self-
assembled structure (Figure 102).[254] They first established
that a 3,6-bis(2-pyridyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (bptz) ligand forms
a molecular square [Fe4(bptz)4(CH3CN)8](BF4)8 with the
BF4
 ion and a pentagon [Fe5(bptz)5(CH3CN)10](SbF6)10
with the SbF6
 ion. X-ray crystallography indicated that
a BF4
 and (two) SbF6
 ions reside within the cavities of the
respective self-assembled structures. It was then demon-
strated that it was possible to convert a SbF6
-templated
pentagon into a square by using a 25-fold excess of BF4
 in
acetonitrile at reflux. The failure to achieve this conversion
under less-stringent conditions (a 15-fold excess of BF4
,
stirring at room temperature), suggests that the pentagonal
SbF6
 capsule is much more stable than the square BF4

structure.
Clever and co-workers have reported upon the elegant
formation of an interpenetrated coordination cage upon
BF4
/Cl metathesis (Figure 103).[255] Formation of a thermo-

7. Conclusion and Outlook
In the last ten years or so, since the last review,[16] a vast
wealth of anion supramolecular research has been under-
taken. Alongside continued interest in anion binding and
sensing, the fields of the use of anions as templates and for
transportation have flourished. Pleasingly, lessons learnt have
been applied to applications such as catalysis, ion extraction,
and responsive materials and molecules.
So, what may be achieved in the next ten, twenty, or even
fifty years? We foresee exploitation and numerous applica-
tions of the “new” anion supramolecular interactions—
anion–p and especially halogen bonding. There will undoubt-
edly be progress in the recognition of anions in aqueous
solvent media, noting that the sensing of anions in cells is still
very much in its infancy. We anticipate that research on anion
transportation will lead to treatments for diseases arising
from anion misregulation. Perhaps most ambitiously, anionic
species may act as stimuli in highly sophisticated responsive
nanotechnological devices and materials, mimicking systems
found in nature. Hence, anion supramolecular chemistry will
continue to be an exciting, innovative, and productive field of
scientific research for many years to come.
