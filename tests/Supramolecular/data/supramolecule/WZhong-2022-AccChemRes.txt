CONSPECTUS: Simple macrocyclic water-soluble hosts such as
cucurbiturils, cyclophanes, and calixarenes have long been used for
biosensing via indicator displacement assays. Using multiple hosts
and dyes in an arrayed format allows pattern recognition-based
“chemical nose” sensing, which confers exquisite selectivity, even
rivaling the abilities of biological recognition tools such as
antibodies. However, a challenge in indicator displacement-based
biosensing with macrocyclic hosts is that selectivity and scope are
often inversely correlated: strong selectivity for a speciﬁc target can
limit wide application, and broad scope sensing can suﬀer from a
lack of selectivity between similar targets. This problem can be
addressed by using water-soluble, self-folding deep cavitands as
hosts. These ﬂexible bowl-shaped receptors can be easily functionalized with diﬀerent motifs at the upper and lower rim, and the
large cavities can bind many diﬀerent ﬂuorescent dyes, causing either ﬂuorescence enhancement or quenching upon binding.
Cavity-based aﬃnity is strongest for NMe3
+ groups such as trimethyl-lysine, and we have exploited this for the site-selective
recognition of post-translational lysine methylations in oligopeptides. The host recognizes the NMe3
+ group, and by applying
diﬀerently functionalized hosts in an arrayed format, discrimination between identical modiﬁcations at diﬀerent positions on the
oligopeptide is possible. Multiple recognition elements can be exploited for selectivity, including a deﬁned, yet “breathable” cavity,
and variable upper rim functions oriented toward the target.
While the performance of the host/guest sensing system is impressive for lysine methylations, the most important advance is the use
of multiple diﬀerent sensing mechanisms that can target a broad range of diﬀerent biorelevant species. The amphiphilic deep
cavitands can both bind ﬂuorescent dyes and interact with charged biomolecules. These non-cavity-based interactions, when paired
with additives such as heavy metal ions, modulate ﬂuorescence response in an indirect manner, and these diﬀerent mechanisms allow
selective recognition of serine phosphorylation, lysine acetylation, and arginine citrullination. Other targets include heavy metals,
drugs of abuse, and protein isoforms. Furthermore, the hosts can be applied in supramolecular tandem assays of enzyme function:
the broad scope allows analysis of such diﬀerent enzymes as chromatin writers/erasers, kinases, and phosphatases, all from a single
host scaﬀold. Finally, the indirect sensing concept allows application in sensing diﬀerent oligonucleotide secondary structures,
including G-quadruplexes, hairpins, triplexes, and i-motifs. Discrimination between DNA strands with highly similar structures such
as G-quadruplex strands with bulges and vacancies can be achieved. Instead of relying on a single highly speciﬁc ﬂuorescent probe,
the synthetic hosts tune the ﬂuorophore−DNA interaction, introducing multiple recognition equilibria that modulate the
ﬂuorescence signal. By applying machine learning algorithms, a classiﬁcation model can be established that can accurately predict the
folding state of unknown sequences. Overall, the unique recognition proﬁle of self-folded deep cavitands provides a powerful, yet
simple sensing platform, one that can be easily tuned for a wide scope of biorelevant targets, in complex biological media, without
sacriﬁcing selectivity in the recognition.

■INTRODUCTION
The ﬁeld of biosensing has been greatly expanded in recent years
by the application of macrocyclic synthetic receptors.5 To
function as an eﬀective host sensor for biological species, the
synthetic receptor must contain a deﬁned cavity into which the
target species can bind and also allow pairing with a suitable
optical reporter molecule. This dye can be displaced upon
recognition of the target, providing an optical output that
converts simple recognition into “sensing”, using indicator
displacement assays (Figure 1a).6 Small molecule hosts (as
opposed to surface-attached sensors5) are also greatly improved
if they are water-soluble. Achieving all these requirements is not
trivial, and the “best” (i.e., most popular) receptors for this
process are macrocycles such as cucurbit[n]urils (CBs),7
cyclophanes,8 sulfonato-calixarenes (CXs),9 and shallow
phosphonate cavitands10 (Figure 1c), as well as other aromatic
macrocycles such as pillararenes.11 Each receptor type has its
advantages and disadvantages, and some exquisite applications
have been shown that highlight the creativity and technical
prowess of the scientists involved.12 Substrate selectivity can be
enhanced by applying the hosts as diﬀerential sensors.13 By use
of multiple hosts and ﬂuorophores in an array, a ﬂuorescence
ﬁngerprint can be generated that, after statistical data
processing,14 provides a simple output that allows diﬀerentiation
and classiﬁcation of highly similar substrates (illustrated in
Figure 1b). The diﬀerential sensing strategy allows synthetic
receptor-based sensors to approach levels of selectivity in
biosensing that are usually only associated with antibodies or
other platforms that exploit biomacromolecules, with none of
the synthetic complexity or expense associated with biological
sensors.15
Challenges still remain, however. The major limitation with
using these privileged hosts is that they tend to favor speciﬁc
targets: each host binds one speciﬁc type of molecular structure
very strongly. For example (and with apologies for this simplistic
generalization), the “best substrates” for CBs are N,N′-
alkyldiammonium ions,16 calixarenes and phosphonate cav-
itands favor methylammonium ions (R-NMe3
+17 and R-
NH2Me+,18,19 respectively), and cyclophanes favor soft cations
such as methylated ammonium20 or guanidinium ions.21
Molecular tweezers are also eﬀective and target unmodiﬁed
lysines in proteins.22,23 All these species are essential molecular
markers and can be found as post-translational modiﬁcations
(PTMs) in proteins,24 drugs of abuse,25 and neurotransmit-
ters,26 among others. They are quite similar in structure to each
other, however, mostly falling into the category of “soft nitrogen-
containing cations”, and as such, many of the most impressive
applications involve a narrow subset of targets. Other vital
targets such as small anions,27 lipids,28 sugars,29 phosphates,30
and nucleotides31 require other types of sensors for detection,
with varying degrees of success.
Obviously, these challenges are endemic for biosensing with
small molecule receptors: small, inﬂexible cavities cannot rival
antibodies or RNA for both substrate binding aﬃnity and scope,
as their deﬁned binding site is limited in the size, shape, and
charge of groups that can be recognized. As a result, there is an

unﬁlled niche in this area: can more ﬂexible, complex synthetic
receptors be used that exploit multiple diﬀerent recognition and
sensing mechanisms for diﬀerent types of targets and are not
restricted to sensing via 1:1 host/guest binding and indicator
displacement assays? In this Account, we describe our work on
biosensing with water-soluble, ﬂexible deep cavitands and
hopefully illustrate the power of these hosts to combine both
strong selectivity and broad scope in sensing a wide array of
complex biological targets.
■MOLECULAR RECOGNITION WITH
WATER-SOLUBLE DEEP CAVITANDS
Self-folding deep cavitands, pioneered by Rebek,32−34 can act as
host molecules for a variety of targets by presenting a large,
deﬁned cavity with a single entry portal to suitably sized guests.
These larger cavities introduce a challenge for solubility
(especially in water) and conformational stability: species with
large open cavities tend to ﬁll those spaces, by either
aggregation,35 dimerization,36 or simply adopting an “un-
desired” conformation.37 One solution is to synthesize large,
rigid deep cavitands, which has been explored to great success by
Gibb.38 Another technique is to use ﬂexible walls and rely on
“self-folding” for conformational stability. This can be achieved
by introducing self-complementary hydrogen bonding groups at
the upper rim of the hosts. Depending on the groups used, the
self-folding technique can even confer conformational stability
on the hosts in water. This, of course, is essential for
biorecognition, which at minimum must be performed in
aqueous solution and hopefully in complex biological media.
Water solubility is usually conferred on the cavitands by
incorporating charged functional groups, at either the upper or
lower rim. We have generally focused on the benzimidazole deep
cavitand scaﬀold (Figure 2a), which uses water molecules as the
hydrogen-bonding agents to ensure proper folding. It should be
noted here that Rebek and Yu have investigated similar types of
cavitand scaﬀolds as small molecule hosts and reactors.39
Our most successful cavitand for biorecognition purposes is
the anionic cavitand TCC (Figure 2a).40 When folded, the cavity
is highly electron rich, with 8 aromatic panels surrounding an
internal space of ∼180 Å3. This is inspired by the
acetylcholinesterase active site, which consists of an “aromatic
box” of tryptophan and tyrosine side chains.41 As such, TCC is
an excellent host for R-NMe3
+ ions (Figure 2c), notably choline
and acetylcholine40,42 and can also bind hydrocarbons of the
correct size and shape.43 Recognition of R-NMe3
+ ions is
generally both enthalpically and entropically favorable. Cati-
on−π and CH−π interactions between host and guest provide
an enthalpic driving force, and as R-NMe3
+ ions are relatively
“greasy”, entropically favorable desolvation of the surrounding
water molecules also occurs upon binding. Importantly, as the
cavitand is open-ended, the selectivity extends to a wide range of
“R” groups. Examples include surfactants,44 proteins,45 poly-
mers,46 and modiﬁed ﬂuorophores.47
There is one more important trait shown by TCC: as the
charged carboxylates reside only on the upper rim of the host, it
is lipophilic and quite prone to self-aggregation. This has allowed
application as a host and sensor in membrane bilayers44−46,48
but also has a large (and complex) eﬀect on the recognition and
sensing of charged and hydrophobic species in water, which is
one of the keys to its broad target scope.
■SELECTIVE RECOGNITION AND SENSING WITH
ARRAYED CAVITAND·FLUOROPHORE
COMPLEXES
While the molecular recognition aspects of deep cavitands have
been extensively analyzed by NMR, coupling this recognition to
an optical output is more challenging. Indicator/ﬂuorescence
displacement assays6 have been widely used with calixarenes
(especially tetrasulfonatocalix[4]arene, CX4,49 or tailored CX4
derivatives50), cucurbit[n]urils,7 cyclophanes,20 and pillarar-
enes.11 Unfortunately, common ﬂuorophores such as lucigenin
(LCG) do not bind in deep cavitands, so we have focused on two

diﬀerent types of ﬂuorophores: combinations of ﬂuorescein or
rhodamine isothiocyanates with cholamine (FCAT and RCAT,
respectively), and styrylpyridinium dyes such as DSMI, PSMI,
MSMI, and DQMI (Figure 2b). Each of these dyes shows
diﬀering aﬃnity and ﬂuorescence response with diﬀerent
cavitands, which is ideal for broad target scope and diﬀerential
sensing. Our initial focus was to establish the scope of the
recognition/sensing system for peptides modiﬁed with methy-
lated lysines: as cavitands such as TCC, CHC, and NHC bind R-
NMe3
+ ions, they are perfectly suited for selective recognition of
trimethyl-lysine groups. Using arrayed deep cavitands has a key
advantage over simple hosts: while the cavities in diﬀerent deep
cavitands are essentially identical, the upper rim functional
groups are oriented directly at the peptide backbone. This
introduces secondary interactions with neighboring side chains,
which, in addition to recognizing the Kme3 group, can be used to
further increase target selectivity.
The simple TCC·FCAT host/dye pair is a powerful sensor for
Kme3 groups in oligopeptides.51 The mechanism is slightly more
complex than simple displacement: upon binding, TCC causes
80% quenching of FCAT via a triggered aggregation mechanism
(Figure 3a). The host/guest binding interaction between TCC
and FCAT triggers the formation of a micellar aggregate of the
amphiphilic cavitand, and FCAT is self-quenched upon
aggregation. Upon addition of the modiﬁed histone H3 peptide
H3K9me3(1−21), the Kme3 residue outcompetes the dye,
displacing it and turning on the sensor. Neither the parent
unmethylated peptide (H3K9) nor the H3K9me variant caused
appreciable recovery of the ﬂuorescence signal: this simple
cavitand·dye sensor is state-selective for diﬀerent lysine
methylations. It should be noted that this selectivity, while an
exciting proof-of-principle for us, is also seen with other known
hosts such as calixarenes52 and cyclophanes,53 which show
stronger aﬃnities for Kme3
54 and greater levels of Kme3/Kme2/
Kme selectivity55 than TCC. However, the most important
advantage of the deep cavitand system is its adaptability: state
selectivity can be achieved with a single host/guest complex, but
for more challenging targets and a ﬁner level of selectivity,
multiple arrayed host/guest complexes are needed. The
constituents of these arrays can be quite varied, including
diﬀerent cavitand hosts, dyes, or other environmental factors.
The initial array focused on varying cavitand structure and
pH: three hosts (negative TCC, neutral CHC and cationic
NHC, Figure 2, 3c) were combined with RCAT at diﬀerent pH
values.1 The thioureas in RCAT can interact synergistically with
the cavitand upper rims: the CS group can favorably interact
with acids, whereas the urea NH groups can interact with bases.
Biasing the pH of the system changes the balance of these
interactions, adding a subtle layer of recognition selectivity
between the hosts and dyes (Figure 3b), as well as the hosts and
the oligopeptide targets. This eﬀect was shown by discriminating
a series of cholamine derivatives1 and then applied to more

complex methylated lysines. Fourteen peptides were tested,
based on the histone H3 sequence, with a variety of diﬀerent
modiﬁcations. These included varying the methylation state at
K9 (K9me0−K9me3), changing the position of the trimethyla-
tion on the backbone (K4/9/27/36/79me3), combining other
PTMs such as phosphorylations and acylations with Kme3 (e.g.,
K4me3K9AcS10p, K79me3T80p), and varying the peptide
length (Figure 3).
A six-factor array was used (the three cavitands (TCC, CHC,
and NHC), RCAT dye, in either pH 7.4 or 9.0 buﬀer).
Fluorescence changes were monitored upon addition of peptide
to each sensor well in the array, and the outputs were analyzed by
principal component analysis (PCA, Figure 3d−f). Diﬀer-
entiating methylation state is simple, but the much greater
challenge is to diﬀerentiate between identical modiﬁcations at
diﬀerent positions on the backbone. This can be achieved with
the 6-component array: peptide strands of the same length with
Kme3 at diﬀerent positions (K4/9/27/36/79) could almost all
be diﬀerentiated with 95% conﬁdence (Figure 3e). The
diﬀerentiation here is subtle, as the cavitands all bind the
Kme3 group, but the relative response is aﬀected by interactions
between the upper rim groups of the cavitand and the adjacent
residues on the peptide backbone. The exact interactions that
bias the aﬃnity in each state are not obvious, but two more sets
of experiments shed some light on the situation. If modiﬁcations
are added to residues adjacent to the Kme3 group (e.g.,
K79me3T80p, Figure 3f), signiﬁcant changes in response are
observed, presumably due to the large change in charge gained
from converting a threonine OH to a phosphate group. The
changes need not be adjacent, however; K4me3K9AcS10p can
be distinguished from K4me3, which indicates that the larger
peptide structure is aﬀecting the recognition. In addition, the
sensor can discriminate peptides where the Kme3 group resides
at the same position, but the length of the peptide changes.1 As
opposed to smaller, rigid hosts such as CX4 and CB7 that are
highly speciﬁc for small molecule targets and functional groups
on peptides, the more lipophilic cavitands are aﬀected by the
superstructure of long peptides. The triggered aggregation
process seen by the TCC·FCAT complex is a good illustration of
this: not only are the cavitands aﬀected by what binds inside the
cavity, but also external interactions aﬀect the ﬂuorescence
response. This has drawbacks: these hosts are notably poor at
sensing individual amino acids, and teasing out the mechanisms
of sensing becomes challenging, but the beneﬁts in enhanced
selectivity and scope are large.
■INDIRECT SENSING OF NON-METHYLATION
MODIFICATIONS
The next step was to utilize these unexpected, non-cavity-based
interactions (i.e., indirect sensing) and extend the target scope to
modiﬁcations other than lysine methylations. The anionic TCC
can interact with cationic peptides in solution via charge-based
interactions rather than cavity-based recognition. This eﬀect is
not dominant when binding Kme3 groups, as the cavity binding
outcompetes charge interactions. However, when 1 is combined
with styrylpyridinium dyes such as DSMI (Figure 2b), the TCC·
DSMI complex can be disrupted by a cationic peptide, which
changes the emission of the dye. This allows host/guest arrays to
be applied in targeting non-methylation PTMs, using the cavity to
bind a suitable dye and the upper rim carboxylates to target
cationic peptides.
The most obvious application is one that gives a large change
in charge to maximize selectivity, namely, phosphorylation of
alcoholic side chains (Ser, Tyr, Thr).2 Figure 4b shows the eﬀect
of a series of cationic peptides and their phosphorylated
counterparts on the ﬂuorescence of the host/dye complexes,
illustrating the selectivity of TCC·DSMI. Whereas the cationic
peptide interacts with the host and competitively displaces
DSMI (which is protruding from the top of the host), this
interaction is reduced with a phosphorylated peptide. The
sensor is not targeting the phosphate group, but the absence of
cationic peptide interactions. Importantly, DSMI binds more
weakly in the TCC than the FCAT or RCAT dyes,1,2 and so can
be displaced upon addition of the cationic peptide. The more
strongly binding dyes can only be displaced by R-NMe3
+ groups,
so they are minimally aﬀected by unmodiﬁed peptides. This
allows tailored selectivity for diﬀerent modiﬁcations, depending
on the dye used.
To achieve the greatest possible diﬀerentiation, arrayed
sensing would be ideal, but as only the anionic TCC can interact
with the cationic peptides, other non-cavitand elements must be
incorporated. Fortunately, TCC shows a surprising aﬃnity for
heavy metal ions in solution.56 Even though the only functional
groups present in the host are carboxylates, micromolar aﬃnity
for large metal ions is seen, mainly due to the fact that the
carboxylate groups in TCC (when folded) are preoriented to
chelate large metals. When TCC is paired with a dye (either

RCAT or DSMI) and metal ions, this introduces multiple
diﬀerent ﬂuorescence responses. The metals can either bind to
the TCC·dye complex or displace the dye from the cavitand or
both. Also, the ﬂuorescence response of the TCC·dye·M
complexes is variable: heavy metals quench the dye, whereas
ﬁlled shell metals (e.g., Zn2+) do not. This has interesting
applications in environmental analysis,56 but for the purposes of
this Account, the most important result is that simply adding
10−50 μM metal ion easily expands the array without needing to
synthesize new hosts or dyes.
A 4-component phosphate sensing array, consisting of TCC,
DSMI, and Cu2+/Co2+/Ni2+/no metal was exposed to a series of
modiﬁed peptides as before (some of which are shown in Figure
4c), and the ﬂuorescence responses were analyzed by linear
discriminant analysis (LDA). The TCC·DSMI·M2+ sensor array
can discriminate phosphorylated peptides from their unphos-
phorylated counterparts, even when those peptides contain
Kme3 modiﬁcations. For example, the three phosphorylated
peptides H3S10p, H3K4me3S10p, and H3K4me3K9AcS10p are
fully separated from H3, H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H3K9Ac
(Figure 4d). The array is also capable of selectively
discriminating phosphorylation at tyrosine or threonine from
serine in diﬀerent peptide strands. Most interestingly, the
sensing of peptide phosphorylations can be performed in
phosphate buﬀer! As the target of the sensor is the unmodiﬁed
peptide, not the phosphate group, the sensing of peptide
phosphorylations is tolerant to phosphate in the media. Some
degradation of performance is seen in phosphate buﬀer when
compared to Tris, but the fact that phosphate sensing is
functional in phosphate buﬀer at all is remarkable.
This concept can be extended to other types of non-
methylation PTMs, although this becomes signiﬁcantly more
challenging as the charge diﬀerences lessen. Lysine acylations
can be discriminated from unmodiﬁed peptides, as the positive
charge in the NH3
+ group is removed upon modiﬁcation.
Similarity, arginine citrullinations (Ci) can be targeted:57 the
change in side chain in this case involves converting the
guanidinium group in Arg to a urea, that is, CNH2
+ becomes
CO. After some optimization, a 4-factor array (TCC·FCAT,
with no metal, La3+, Ni2+, or Zn2+) was shown to distinguish
H3R2Ci and H3R2CiR8Ci from H3(1−21), so in this case, the
sensor shows modiﬁcation state selectivity. However, positional
selectivity is more challenging: discriminating between H3R2Ci
and H3R8Ci requires two dyes, two metals, and analysis via 3D
PCA for full separation. Still, this is a challenging target for
sensing, so even this moderate selectivity is impressive.
■SUPRAMOLECULAR TANDEM ASSAYS
Small molecule hosts such as CB[7] and CX4 have been widely
used in supramolecular tandem assays of enzyme function,58
including cholinesterases,59 proteases,60 oxidases,61 lysine
methyltransferase,62 and kinases,63 among others.64,65 These
systems usually monitor indicator displacement by either the
reactant or product of the enzymatic reaction over time. This is a
simple, eﬀective monitoring method that relies on the aﬃnity of
small molecules for the host. However, this can be challenging to

apply for large, complex targets and cannot detect positionally
selective enzyme reactions such as those of chromatin writers
and erasers. As the deep cavitand sensors can provide
positionally selective sensing, the obvious next step was to
apply this to enzyme reaction monitoring.3,51
The key to all supramolecular tandem assays is to ensure that
the target binding process is not aﬀected by the required
conditions for the enzymatic reaction. Whereas simple
recognition of Kme3 peptides can be performed in a controlled
aqueous environment, monitoring the function of lysine
demethylase JMJD2E requires that the sensor be tolerant to
the enzyme itself, as well as cofactors such as Fe2+, sodium
ascorbate, and 2-oxoglutarate. Fortunately, the TCC·FCAT
sensing pair is not aﬀected by these conditions. While Fe2+ has
some eﬀect on the ﬂuorescence response, it is small enough in
this case to not aﬀect peptide detection. Upon addition of TCC·
FCAT to a solution of H3K9me3 in the presence of JMJD2E and
required cofactors, the modiﬁed peptide displaces FCAT from
the host, “turning on” the ﬂuorophore.51 Over time, as the
enzyme removes the methyl groups from H3K9me3, the
ﬂuorophore is reclaimed by the host, and the drop in
ﬂuorescence over time allows monitoring of enzyme activity,
including determining the Ki of a suitable inhibitor.51 This shows
that the TCC·FCAT sensing pair can monitor lysine
demethylase activity, but this is not unique, as Nau has shown
this type of assay using CB[7].62 However, the cavitand-based
arrays are capable of much more than simply monitoring
activity: by using multiple cavitands and dyes, site-selective
monitoring of enzyme activity is possible in complex mixtures of
modiﬁed peptides.3 The arrayed tandem assay follows the same
principle as the simple one-component FDA process: Kme3
groups displace ﬂuorophores from the cavitand(s), and
enzymatic removal of those methyl groups allows recombination
of the cavitand·dye complex, lowering the observed ﬂuores-
cence. In this case, a three-component methylation-sensitive
array was used, with TCC, CHC, and NHC cavitands and
RCAT dye at pH 7.4 (to ensure proper enzyme function). For
monitoring the site-selective JMJD2E demethylation process,
three modiﬁed peptides were combined and subjected to
enzymatic demethylation (Figure 5a): K4me3, K9me3, and
K27me3. Only K9me3 is demethylated by JMJD2E, and the
product is the monomethylated peptide K9me. The reactions
were added to each array well, and the sensor responses at
various time points were subjected to PCA, together with a series
of controls corresponding to all possible outcomes of the
reaction (i.e., demethylation of the other peptides as well as the
“correct” target).
As the reaction proceeds (Figure 5a), the reaction mixture
moves toward the position where K9me + K4me3 + K27me3 is
located, and further away from the other two controls, indicating
that the enzyme acts on only the K9 methylation site, but not K4
nor K27 (Figure 5b,c). The analysis is capable of distinguishing
not only incorrect reaction products but also the state of the
product: fully demethylated K9 is distinguishable from K9me.
This methylation-sensitive array is also capable of site-selective
monitoring of methylation writer enzymes.
As well as sensing the “obvious” targets of lysine methylation
enzymes with cavitand·dye arrays, the indirect sensing concept
can be used to monitor kinase (Figure 5e) and phosphatase
activity. The challenge here is that kinases require the presence
of both ATP and cAMP for reaction, which is quite diﬃcult for
sensors that detect the phosphate group! Fortunately, as the
TCC·DSMI sensor shows no aﬃnity for small phosphates and
its ﬂuorescence is mediated by the nature of the cationic peptide,
it is capable of monitoring kinase activity. Figure 5f shows one
example of the sensing performance: phosphorylation of
peptides H3(1−21) and H3Kme3 by protein kinase A was
monitored by both the TCC·DSMI sensor and MALDI-MS
analysis of aliquots drawn from solution. The ﬂuorescence
changes follow the phosphorylation process well, and this sensor
is not aﬀected by the presence of a Kme3 group, despite using the
same cavitand host. Other examples of enzymes that can be
analyzed include aurora kinase A and alkaline phosphatase.2
■INDIRECT SENSING MECHANISMS FOR
STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF DNA 3D STRUCTURE
The indirect sensing mechanism for phosphate sensing
illustrates that cavitands are capable of sensing biorelevant
targets that do not bind in the cavity, as there are multiple
mechanisms of interaction and ﬂuorescence response that can
be exploited. The logical extension of this concept is to use the
hosts as ﬂuorescence modulators rather than the recognition
element, that is, use dyes as the primary recognition motif, and

add the hosts as competitive sensing elements. This allows
sensing of unexpected targets, namely, noncanonically folded
nucleic acid strands.4,66 The anionic cavitand TCC has no
aﬃnity for DNA or RNA at all, which is quite obvious. However,
the styrylpyridinium dyes are ideally shaped for interaction with
DNA: they are rigid, cationic, and slightly kinked, mirroring the
general structure of known DNA ligands.67 As there are myriad
small molecule dyes that can simply “detect” DNA, we focused
on a diﬀerent goal: can arrayed host/guest complexes sense
small diﬀerences in DNA structure that cannot be simply
detected by sequence analysis? Nucleotide strands can form
complex 3D structures other than the paradigmatic double helix:
examples of noncanonical folds include G-quadruplexes (G4s),
Hoogsteen triplexes, and hairpins and i-motifs, among others.
Despite some notable recent advances,68,69 it remains
challenging to analyze noncanonical structures from sequences
alone and often requires modiﬁed nucleotides,70−72 X-ray
crystallography, or multidimensional NMR spectroscopy for
complete structural analysis.
The initial target was a series of DNA G4 strands. G4s are
generally classiﬁed into three diﬀerent structural topologies:
parallel, antiparallel or hybrid (Figure 6a). The structural
diﬀerences between the topologies are small, varying in the
conformation of the guanine glycosidic angles (syn or anti) and
the relative orientation of the strands. The styrylpyridinium dyes
bind G4 DNA strands with micromolar aﬃnity4,66 and show
enhanced emission while bound. They also show strong aﬃnity
for cavitand hosts in water. As such, we combined a series of
hosts, TCC, CHI, CHP, and AMI (Figure 2a), and a shallow
phosphonate cavitand provided by the Dalcanale group10 with
DSMI and PSMI dyes and monitored the ﬂuorescence changes
upon addition of a series of DNA strands. This 10-component
array was highly responsive to changes in nucleotide structure.
The potential of the array was shown by focusing on diﬀerent
G4s: 23 diﬀerent sequences (6 parallel, 8 antiparallel and 9
hybrid, all with lengths of 22−26 bases) could all be fully
discriminated based on their folding type. This result was further
conﬁrmed by canonical discriminant analysis (Figure 6b), which
shows correct classiﬁcation of 114 out of 115 samples (including
repeats) into the three topologies.
While the classiﬁcation ability of the array is excellent, the
discriminatory power is also impressive. The sensor can easily
discriminate the parallel G4 structures from the hybrid nad
antiparallel topologies. Figure 6c focuses on the diﬀerentiation
between hybrid and antiparallel strands, which both contain one
or two of the four G strands in an orientation opposite to the
others and display anti and syn guanines. They are even
sometimes considered as a single topology group,73 making their
diﬀerentiation by simple methods highly challenging. The
antiparallel and hybrid G4s that colocate close to each other are
all of similar lengths (22−26 nts) and all display three G-quartet
stacks. The antiparallel structures that vary in the number of G-
quartet stacks are fully separated from the 3-stack G-quartets
(either antiparallel or hybrid). Some impressive discrimination
eﬀects can also be seen for the 3-stack G4s (Figure 6c). Although
2KKA has high sequence similarity to 2KF8, AG22, wtTel23, and
wtTel24 (varying only by the absence of one T or one A on the 3′
or 5′ end), it is well separated from the other strands. The limit
of detection (LOD) ranges from 3 to 36 nM, and the material
usage is low: the minimum total DNA consumption is <12 pmol.
The sensor also performs well in the presence of interfering
compounds like lysozyme, lactose, and serum and can sense
topology switches triggered by substituting K+ with Na+ in the
buﬀer.
The excellent selectivity shown by the initial array in
discriminating G4 structures allowed application to other

folds.66 The key to the detection and the diﬀerential selectivity is
the synergistic combination of both host and dye interacting with
DNA folded structures. Figure 7a shows a representation of the
sensing mechanism, which illustrates the complexity of the
system. The dyes all bind to the DNA and show diﬀerential
emission enhancement when bound. The host·dye complexes
can also form ternary complexes with folded DNA. Cationic
cavitands can interact with structured DNA while binding the
dyes, and this complex interaction adds a level of selectivity that
is not possible with the dyes alone. The hosts are essential for
selective sensing, even though the dyes are the main reporters.
An improved modiﬁed sensor array (hosts CHI, CHP, and
AMI and dyes DSMI, PSMI, DQMI, MSMI)66 was applied to a
series of 18 other nonclassical DNA folded structures, including
hairpins, Hoogsteen triplexes, and i-motifs, as well as imperfect
G4s with bulges or vacancies. These targets ranged from entirely
diﬀerent folding motif structures, such as triplexes, to those with
very small diﬀerences, such as bulges or vacancies in G4
structure. Interrogating 18 DNAs with 16 array elements
established a multidimensional data set with 1440 data points.
This large and multidimensional data set illustrates the power
and the limitations of the array-based analysis: it is not simple to
quantify the classiﬁcation eﬀect, nor easy to pick out the most
eﬀective components from such a large and complex data set.
This is where machine learning approaches can be exploited, to
select the most optimal array elements, evaluate the
classiﬁcation eﬀect, and even predict unknown DNA folding.
The ﬂuorescence output from the array was analyzed by the
support vector machine (SVM) algorithm,74,75 followed by a
PCA step to minimize data dimensions, and visualized in a 2D
SVM decision region boundary (DRB) plot (Figure 7b,c).
Training the SVM-RFE algorithm with the data from the known
DNA pool can lead to a classiﬁcation model that permits the use
of the ﬂuorescence responses from an “unknown” DNA to
predict its folding motif. To test this hypothesis, we chose 4
DNA strands with known folding motif as “unknown” targets: c-
myc 2345 and EAD4 (known to form a parallel G4 structure),
APE 1−4 track (an i-motif), and Telo24 (a hybrid G4). The
resultant PC values were then projected to the original DRB plot
by the classiﬁers resulting from running scaled 2D PCA-coupled
SVM-RFE on the training data set. The location of the unknown
DNA (shown as solid blocks in Figure 7b) shows successful
prediction: all of the 10 repeats for each of the “unknown”
targets located within the boundary for their corresponding
folding. This is remarkable, because the DNA pool contained
structures with high similarity, including parallel vs hybrid G4s
and parallel G4s with bulges or vacancies that diﬀer by only one
base.
■OUTLOOK
The outlook for biosensing with synthetic receptors is very
exciting. The last four decades (or so) have seen a steady
progression in the “diﬃculty” of application: the initial focus was
on molecular recognition in organic solvents, then progressed to
function in water and biological media. The complexity of
targets has increased along with it, from the pioneering work on
cation recognition, to anions and small neutral molecules and
then to truly biologically important species such as amino acids,
peptides, and nucleotides. Water-soluble deep cavitands are an
enticing structural motif for biosensing, as they are high aﬃnity
hosts for important biological targets, can be easily tuned, and
exploit multiple diﬀerent recognition mechanisms for diﬀer-
ential sensing of diverse targets in the presence of diﬀerent
targets. As well as the targets described here, we have used
cavitand/dye combinations to detect other relevant molecules,
including protein isoforms,76 biothiols,77 and hydrophobic
species such as steroids,78 cannabinoids,79 or insect pher-
omones.80
There are a couple of important “next steps” for synthetic
receptor-based biosensing. Diﬀerential sensing is a powerful
tool, and can take advantage of Big Data to use machine learning
and AI approaches to truly achieve the selectivity and sensitivity
of antibody-based sensing. An important task is to selectively
recognize and conﬁrm target identity in a highly complex
mixture of similar components, rather than detecting individual
standards in pure solutions. This will require a combination of
synthetic organic chemistry and statistical analysis to provide a
large suite of host and dye combinations and the computing
power to pick out essential elements for optimized sensing. Also,
as has been elegantly described by Hof,50 an important task is to
move away from pure water as a medium and to focus on
biorelevant conditions for recognition, including high salt
concentration and the presence of lipid aggregates (membranes
and liposomes) and other competitive species, as well as on
function in biomedia such as urine, saliva, serum, cells, and living
organisms. Some elegant work has been performed to illustrate
the diﬃculties in molecular recognition in these types of media
but also the opportunities.81,82 Obviously, as the application
medium becomes more challenging, choice of receptor tends to
revert to those with the most well understood mechanisms of
action, such as calixarenes and cucurbiturils. Flexible deep
cavitands are far more variable and complex in their behavior:
this has allowed us to study a wide range of targets and show
powerful selectivity, but we have only just started to apply them
in complex media: we have shown that selectivity persists in
serum,4 urine,78,79 and saliva79 and applied them in human
cells,47 but happily, there is still much to be done.
