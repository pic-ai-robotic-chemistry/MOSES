Pillar-Shaped Macrocyclic Hosts Pillar[n]arenes: New Key Players for
Supramolecular Chemistry
ABSTRACT: In 2008, we reported a new class of pillar-shaped macrocyclic hosts,
known as “pillar[n]arenes”. Today, pillar[n]arenes are recognized as key players in
supramolecular chemistry because of their facile synthesis, unique pillar shape, versatile
functionality, interesting host−guest properties, and original supramolecular assembly
characteristics, which have resulted in numerous electrochemical and biomedical material
applications. In this Review, we have provided historical background to macrocyclic
chemistry, followed by a detailed discussion of the fundamental properties of
pillar[n]arenes, including their synthesis, structure, and host−guest properties.
Furthermore, we have discussed the applications of pillar[n]arenes to materials science,
as well as their applications in supramolecular chemistry, in terms of their fundamental
properties. Finally, we have described the future perspectives of pillar[n]arene chemistry.
We hope that this Review will provide a useful reference for researchers working in the
field and inspire discoveries concerning pillar[n]arene chemistry.


1. INTRODUCTION
The design and synthesis of new macrocyclic host molecules
represent challenging areas of research. However, it is envisaged
that new developments in this field will open the unrealized
potential of supramolecular chemistry and provide access to new
host molecules with unique functional characteristics that result
from their unique shape, reactivity, and host−guest properties.
From a historical perspective, it is clear that the arrival of new
macrocyclic host systems in 1890 triggered an intense period of
research and development in the field of supramolecular
chemistry. The characteristics of an effective host compound
are covered by the following points (Figure 1).
(1) Shape: Prospective host compounds should possess a
unique shape that has not been reported previously in the
literature. (2) Synthesis: Host compounds should be easy to
make in large quantities from inexpensive reagents. (3)
Solubility: Host compounds should be highly soluble in organic
solvents and aqueous media such that they can be subject to
various organic reactions to allow for the unlimited functionalization of the macrocyclic compounds. In addition, a reasonable
degree of solubility is required to investigate their molecular
recognition abilities. (4) Versatile functionality: Host compounds should contain reactive functional groups that can be
converted to other functional groups using simple organic
reactions to maximize their assembly and molecular recognition
properties in various media. (5) Homologues and host−guest
ability: Macrocyclic host compounds should have at least one
homologue that can accommodate guest molecules on the basis
of its cyclic structure. Taken together, these points indicate that a
prospective host molecule should show guest shape-selectivity
and high binding ability, as well as having homologues with
different cavity sizes that show different host−guest abilities
depending on their cavity size. To provide a greater understanding of the five points listed above, we discussed them in
detail below by taking some of the most well-known host
molecules, including cyclodextrins (CDs),1−10 crown
ethers,11−17 calix[n]arenes,18−21 and cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]-
s)22−32 as examples.
(1) Shape: The shape of a macrocyclic compound is one of its
important characteristics. CDs and calix[n]arenes are nonsymmetrical bucket- and calix-shaped structures, respectively,
whereas CB[n]s are highly symmetrical pumpkin-like structures.
Crown ethers, identified by C. J. Pedersen in 1967,11 have crownlike structures on their X-ray crystal structures.
(2) Synthesis: CDs can be obtained from starch using an
enzymatic process, and robust processes of this type have been
developed to provide efficient access to large quantities of CD
homologues consisting six, seven, and even eight glucopyranose
units, (i.e., α-, β-, and γ-CDs). CD homologues with different
cavity sizes can therefore be purchased at a moderate price. In
contrast, crown ethers, calix[n]arenes, and CB[n]s can only be
produced by synthetic chemistry. Crown ether homologues can
be produced in relatively high yields using the metal cationtemplate method,11 while calix[n]arene homologues can be
prepared by tuning temperature and base concentration
conditions of the base-induced oligomerization between phenols
and formaldehyde.20 CB[n]s are prepared by the condensation
reaction of glycoluril and formaldehyde.27 By tuning the reaction
temperature of this process, it is possible to obtain a mixture of
CB[n] homologues.28 However, it has not yet been possible to
achieve the selective synthesis of specific CB[n] homologues, and
an additional purification step is therefore required to isolate
CB[n] homologues from the mixture.
(3) Solubility: CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of
several glucopyranose units, and consequently have many
hydroxyl groups. Native CDs therefore exhibit good solubility
in highly polar solvents such as water, N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), but are insoluble in
solvents with intermediate dielectric constants such as acetone,
tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform, and dichloromethane, as
well as nonpolar solvents such as n-hexane. CB[n]s also exhibit
poor solubility problems. The cyclic hexamer CB[6] was
originally reported by Mock et al. in 1981.27 Unfortunately, the
poor solubility of CB[6] in aqueous media (0.018 mM) meant
that research pertaining to the development of CB[n] chemistry
progressed at a slow pace until 2000. In 2000, Kim et al.
developed a new process for the synthesis of CB[n] homologues
(n = 5−11) by tuning the reaction condition.28 These new CB[n]
homologues showed moderate solubility in water (e.g., CB[5],
420 mM; CB[7], 370 mM), which allowed for the rapid
development of CB[n] chemistry following Kim’s discovery in
2000. In contrast, crown ethers are soluble in a variety of solvents
because they contain amphiphilic oligo(ethylene oxide) chains.
Calix[n]arenes also show high solubility in a wide range of
organic solvents, including chloroform, acetone, THF, DMF, and
DMSO. 


(4) Functionality: Native CDs have many highly reactive
hydroxyl groups, which can be used to introduce a variety of
functional groups.5 However, the poor solubility of CDs in the
organic solvents typically used in synthesis means that they
cannot be subjected to a large range of organic reactions,
therefore limiting the number of functional groups that can be
added to these macrocyclic host platforms. Reactions for the
functionalization of CDs are mainly conducted in amphiphilic
solvents such as DMF and DMSO, as well as aqueous media,
because of their poor solubility. The yields of the reactions used
for the functionalization of CDs are therefore relatively low in
most cases. To overcome this problem, several organo-soluble
CDs have been synthesized by introducing protecting moieties
such as methyl and benzyl groups to the hydroxyl groups of the
CDs.9,10 The resulting organo-soluble CDs can be subjected to a
much wider variety of organic reactions than the parent CDs to
obtain suitably functionalized CDs. Calix[n]arenes show good
solubility in most typical organic solvents and have several
reactive phenolic moieties, which have allowed for the
preparation of various functionalized calix[n]arenes.18 In the
case of simple crown ethers, there are no reactive moieties, and
the design of crown ethers bearing reactive functional groups
therefore requires additional functionalization steps prior to the
macrocyclization of the crown ether ring. The poor functionality
of CB[n]s was a long-standing problem for CB[n] chemistry,
which was only confounded by their poor solubility. To
overcome this limitation in CB[n] chemistry, Kim et al.
developed the direct oxidation of CB[n]s in 2003, which allowed
for the direct introduction of reactive hydroxyl groups into
CB[n]s.29 Isaacs et al. subsequently developed monofunctionalized CB[n]s by the macrocyclization of the linear glycoluril
pentamer with phthalaldehydes bearing a variety of different
functional groups.30,31
(5) Homologues and host−guest ability: CDs are soluble in
aqueous media, and the inside of the CD cavity is a hydrophobic
microenvironment. CDs can therefore capture suitably sized
hydrophobic guest molecules in their hydrophobic cavity from
aqueous media. The driving force for this complexation process is
based on hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions. Three kinds of
CDs, α-, β-, and γ-CDs, have been used for most of the research
concerning the complexation of hydrophobic molecules from
aqueous media. The host−guest properties of these CDs are
largely dependent on their cavity sizes.3 CB[n]s are also watersoluble hosts, and have rigid structures with no conformational
flexibility because of the rigidity of the double methylene bridge
connecting their glycoluril units. In a manner similar to CDs, the
cavity of CB[n]s is a hydrophobic environment. Furthermore,
CB[n]s have two negatively charged carbonyl-laced portals.
CB[n]s can therefore accommodate hydrophobic guests with
positively charged ammonium cations.24,25 Inoue et al. reported
that CB[7] formed a very stable host−guest complex with a
ferrocene derivative bearing two ammonium cations (K = 3.0 ×
1015 M−1).32 The high binding affinity of this complex was similar
to that of the enzyme−substrate complex formed between avidin
and biotin (K > 1015 M−1). The superior host−guest ability of
CB[n]s is one of the main advantages of these systems as
compared to typical host molecules, and one of the main reasons
that CB[n]s have been widely used in recent studies. The host−
guest properties of crown ethers and calix[n]arenes have been
investigated in organic media. The unpaired electrons on the
oxygen atoms of the crown ethers contribute to their ability to
form strong binding interactions with metal cations. Thus, the
driving force for these complexation processes is the formation of
a coordination interaction between the metal cations and the
oxygen atoms of the crown ether. In the case of calix[n]arenes,
the individual phenolic moieties act as electron-donating groups,
and the calix[n]arenes consequently form host−guest complexes
with cationic molecules through cation/π interactions.20 The
phenolic moieties situated on the lower rim of calix[n]arenes can
also capture metal cations by coordination interactions.21



Against this historical backdrop, we successfully developed a
new class of pillar-shaped macrocyclic host compounds in 2008, which subsequently became known as pillar[n]arenes.33 As
compared to the typical host molecules mentioned above,
pillar[n]arenes have characteristic highly symmetrical pillarshaped structures, which are similar in many respects to that of
highly symmetrical pumpkin-shaped hosts CB[n]s. The
repeating units of pillar[n]arenes are composed of phenolic
moieties, making them structurally similar to calix[n]arenes.
Pillar[n]arenes also have many phenolic moieties on both rims,
making them very similar to the highly functionalized macrocyclic CD compounds. It is clear from discussion that
pillar[n]arenes combine many of the interesting features of the
typical macrocyclic compounds discussed above. Pillar[n]arenes
also have several other characteristic features such as superior
host−guest abilities, planar chirality, and the ability to undergo
self-assembly processes with highly symmetrical structures
because of their shape. Today, almost 8 years after our initial
discovery of pillar[n]arenes, new reports continue to emerge
describing the remarkable properties of these compounds and
their complexes following efforts of pillar[n]arene chemists.34−43
On the basis of their novel cross section of properties and their
vast potential, pillar[n]arenes are fast becoming key players in the
field of macrocyclic chemistry, as well as creating several new
opportunities that give them a much greater reach over other key
players in the area of research in terms of their potential
applications. Figure 2 shows the number of research papers on
pillar[n]arenes published by year.
The area of research that we currently refer to as “pillar[n]-
arene chemistry” started in 2008 with just a small group of
pillar[n]arene chemists. For this reason, the total number of
papers published between 2008 and 2011 was only 33. However,
the level of interest in pillar[n]arene chemistry, as well as the
number of researchers working in this area, has grown
considerably since 2012 and now is to the point where there
are now numerous pillar[n]arene chemists all over the world.
This growth in the popularity and intensity of the research in this
area is exemplified by the dramatic increase in the number of
research paper published since 2012. Furthermore, Tokyo
Chemical Industry (TCI) became the first chemical company
to commercialize a pillar[5]arene product, when they started to
sell per-methylated pillar[5]arene 1[5] (Scheme 1) in 2014,
further emphasizing the significance of these compounds.44
This Review covers the peer-reviewed papers published on
pillar[n]arene chemistry since this area of research in began 2008.
First, we discuss the synthesis of pillar[n]arenes, which is the
starting point of pillar[n]arene chemistry. Second, we discuss the
fundamental properties of pillar[n]arenes, including their
structures, planar chirality, and host−guest properties. Finally,
we discuss the applications of pillar[n]arenes, including pillar-
[n]arene-based mechanically interlocked molecules, supramolecular assemblies, hybrids, electronic, and biomedical
materials.


2. SYNTHESIS OF PILLAR[n]ARENES
Pillar[n]arenes were discovered as a product of chance. The
preparation of phenol-paraformaldehyde resins using a featureless and commercially available phenolic monomer, 1,4-
dimethoxybenzene, led to the appearance of a fascinating
macrocycle, per-methylated pillar[5]arene 1[5] (Scheme 1).33
One of the interesting features of pillar[n]arenes is the position
of the methylene bridge between 1,4-dimethoxybenzene
constituent units. 1,4-Dimethoxybenzene units are connected
by a methylene bridge at the 2,5-position (para-position), which
contributes to the highly symmetrical pillar-shaped architecture.
Historically, reaction of phenolic derivatives with aldehydes has
afforded various macrocyclic compounds.20 However, to obtain
phenolic macrocyclic compounds, there are two key factors. One
is controlling the reaction point of phenolic derivatives to inhibit
the formation of three-dimensional network polymers. The other
is the inhibition of the linear polymer formation and acceleration
of macrocyclization.
2.1. Controlling the Reaction Points of Phenolic Derivatives
for the Regioselective Formation of Macrocyclic
Compounds
Phenol, the simplest monomer, affords three-dimensional
network polymers in many cases by reaction with aldehydes
because phenol has three electron-rich reaction sites at the 2, 4, 6-
positions (ortho- and para-positions, Scheme 2a).
The introduction of protecting groups at the reaction sites or
neighboring positions of the electron-rich reaction sites
contributes to the inhibition of three-dimensional polymer
formations and the generation of linear oligomers, which are
intermediates for the formation of macrocyclic compounds.
Calix[n]arenes, in which para-substituted phenols are
connected by methylene bridges at the ortho-positions, can be
obtained by the condensation of para-substituted phenol
derivatives with formaldehydes under appropriate conditions
(Scheme 2b).18−20 When para-substituted phenols were used as
the monomer, calix[n]arenes linked at the 2- and 6-positions
were produced because the electron density at the 2- and 6-
positions is higher than that at the 3- and 5-positions, and the
electron-rich site at the 4-position is protected by the substituent.
Calix[4]resorcinarenes, in which four resorcinarene molecules
are connected at their 4 and 6 positions, were obtained by condensation of resorcinarene with aldehydes under controlled
conditions (Scheme 2c).45 The 2-, 4-, and 6-positions of
resorcinarene are electron-rich, but steric hindrance by phenolic
moieties reduces the reactivity at the 2-position. When 1,2-
dialkoxybenzenes were used as monomers, the reaction sites
were the 4- and 5-positions because the reactions at the 3- and 6-
positions are unfavorable due to the steric hindrance. Cyclotriveratrylenes, which are macrocyclic trimers of 1,2-dialkoxybenzenes, were obtained under controlled conditions in the
1980s (Scheme 2d).46 The quest to discover new and exciting
macrocyclic compounds using various phenolic derivatives is a
timely topic (Scheme 3), which has been inspired by the
discovery of pillar[n]arenes in 2008.
In 2013, Stoddart et al. reported a new family of macrocycles,
asar[n]arenes, using 1,2,4,5-tetramethoxybenzene as the monomer (Scheme 3a).47
In this case, the reaction sites were only at the 3- and 6-
positions of 1,2,4,5-tetramethoxybenzene. Thus, para-bridged
macrocyclic compounds were obtained. When the reaction
temperature was 36 °C, a mixture of asar[n]arene homologues
was obtained under kinetically controlled conditions; however,
under heating condition at 80 °C, cyclic hexamer, asar[6]arene,
was obtained as a thermodynamic product. In 2015, Li and coworkers reported biphen[n]arenes, which are composed of 4,4′-
biphenol ether units linked by methylene bridges at the 3- and 3′-
positions under controlled conditions (Scheme 3b).48 Szumna et
al. reported the cocyclization of 1,3- and 1,4-dimethoxybenzenes
to produce new macrocyclic compounds, hybrid[n]arenes, which
are composed of 1,3- and 1,4-dimethoxybenzene units (Scheme
3c).49 A combination of pillar[n]arene and resorcinarene
chemistry contributes to the synthesis of hybrid[n]arenes.
Therefore, the numbers, electron density, and steric hindrance
determine where the reaction sites will react with aldehydes.
There is an unlimited potential in this field if we can design
monomer structures and promote macrocyclization.
Since 2006, we have investigated the reaction of 1,4-
dimethoxybenzene with paraformaldehyde to synthesize new
macrocyclic compounds (Scheme 1). By choosing appropriate
reaction conditions, new macrocyclic compounds, pillar[5]-
arenes, have been obtained in 2008. In pillar[5]arene, 1,4-
dimethoxybenzene units are connected by a methylene bridge at
the para-positions (2- and 5-positions). The starting compound,
1,4-dimethoxybenzene, has four electronically equal reaction
sites (2-, 3-, 5-, and 6-positions). However, steric hindrance is
produced after the addition of paraformaldehyde. After the
reaction of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene with paraformaldehyde at the
2-position, the second addition of paraformaldehyde selectively
occurs at the 5-position, while the other reaction sites (3- and 6-
positions) hardly react with paraformaldehyde. This phenomenon derives from steric hindrance. The reaction site at the 3-
position between a methylene bridge and methoxy moiety is not
reactive because of steric hindrance. The other reaction site at the
6-position is also affected by the steric hindrance of the methoxy
moiety at the 1-position. Therefore, at the second addition step,
the 5-position site is able to selectively react with paraformaldehyde.


2.2. Formation of Pillar[5]arenes under Thermodynamic
Control
The synthesis of macrocyclic compounds is generally controlled
kinetically and thermodynamically.50 In a kinetically controlled
process, the reaction temperature and time largely effect the yield
of the macrocyclic compounds. However, a wide range of cyclic
homologues and/or polymers are generally produced. Thus,
macrocyclizations carried out under kinetically controlled
conditions are generally low yielding reactions. For example,
the macrocyclization of CB[n] homologues has been carried out under kinetic control.24 The key factor is the reaction
temperature, and the reaction mixture under controlled reaction
temperature yields CB[n] homologues ranging from pentamer to
11-mer. The yield of hexamer, CB[6], was highest (50−60%),
while yields of CB[5], CB[7], and CB[8] were approximately
10%, and higher CB[n] homologues (n ≥ 9) were yielded in trace
amounts. This is because CB[6] has the lowest strain structure
among CB[n] homologues. In the thermodynamically controlled
process, additives act as a template to form a particular
macrocycle. As a result, the particular macrocycle is obtained in
good yield. Thus, the formation of macrocyclic compounds
under thermodynamic control is extremely attractive. Crown
ethers can be obtained under thermodynamic control using
metal cation templates.11 Particular crown ethers can be
selectively formed in the presence of appropriate metal cations,
which are able to fit into the cavity of the prepared crown ether.
Cyclic pentamers, pillar[5]arenes, can be obtained in high
yield under optimized conditions because the formation of
pillar[5]arenes should take place under thermodynamic control.
We investigated the effect of the type of Lewis acid on the
macrocyclization.33 When we used BF3OEt2, the product was
mainly pillar[5]arene 1[5], while a mixture of polymer and 1[5]
was obtained using other Lewis acids such as FeCl3, AlCl3, and
SnCl2. Therefore, we envisioned that BF3OEt2 played a role as
template for the formation of 1[5]. However, contrary to our
expectation, Szumna et al. reported a high yield of synthesis of
1[5] using organic acids (Table 1).51
1[5] was obtained in moderate yield (38%) using paratoluenesulfonic acid (Table 1, entry 1), but was not obtained
when acetic acid and aqueous HCl solution were used (entries 2
and 3). Using the strong organic acid, trifluoroacetic acid resulted
in a high yield synthesis of 1[5] (entry 4, 81%). The yield of 1[5]
was still high even in a small amount of water (entry 5), indicating
that the synthesis of pillar[5]arene 1[5] can be achieved even in
an air environment. Zhang and Yang et al. determined the
optimized reaction conditions for the synthesis of 1[5] using
para-toluenesulfonic acid. A long reaction time and reflux
conditions allowed the formation of 1[5] in high yield (entry 6,
66%).52
The other important factor is the type of solvent for the
synthesis of the pillar[5]arenes. Szumna et al. investigated the
solvent effect on the synthesis of pillar[5]arenes.51 When 1,2-
dichloroethane was used as the solvent, the yield of 1[5] was high
(Table 1, entry 4, up to 81% under optimized conditions).
However, the yield was low using dichloromethane (entry 7,
26%), chloroform (entry 8, 15%), and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane
(entry 9, 7%). Pillar[5]arenes selectively form host−guest
complexes with linear-shaped molecules (see details in section
5); thus, linear 1,2-dichloroethane acts as a template solvent for
the synthesis of pillar[5]arenes (Figure 3a). In contrast,
chloroform and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane have branched structures (Figure 3a). Pillar[5]arenes cannot form host−guest
complexes with branched molecules. Therefore, such branched
structures cannot act as template solvents for the synthesis of
pillar[5]arenes (Figure 3b).
The template effect for pillar[5]arene formation was
confirmed by monitoring the time-dependent SEC traces
(Figure 3c).53 After 10 s, the peak from the 1,4-dimethoxybenzene monomer quickly decreased and peaks from the
oligomer (retention volume 20−22 mL) and per-methylated
pillar[5]arene 1[5] (retention volume 22 mL) were observed. A
decrease in the amount of the oligomer and an increase in the
amount of 1[5] were subsequently observed as the reaction time
was increased. After 150 s, the peak from 1[5] was only detected,
indicating the completion of the cyclization reaction. Hence, the
reaction was completed in just 150 s, and thus the reaction
proceeded under thermodynamic control. Pillar[5]arenes with
different lengths of linear alkyl chains and branched alkyl groups,
such as ethoxy 2[5], propoxy 3[5], butoxy 4[5], pentyloxy 5[5],
hexyloxy 6[5], dodecanoxy 7[5], and 2(S)-methylbutoxy 8[5]
groups, can also be prepared from the corresponding 1,4- dialkoxybenzene monomers using 1,2-dichloroethane as a
template solvent (Scheme 4a).54,55
Preparation of pillar[5]arenes via different pathways was also
reported by Huang et al., and Cao and Meier et al. using 2,5-
bis(alkoxymethyl)-1,4-diethoxybenzene (path I, Scheme 4b) as
monomers and 2,5-dialkoxybenzyl bromides (path II).56−58
Reaction of these monomers with Lewis acids or para-toluene
sulfonic acid afforded pillar[5]arenes as the major products. In
the reaction, pillar[6]arenes were also produced as minor
products.


2.3. Formation of Pillar[6]arenes under Kinetic and
Thermodynamic Control
The first pillar[6]arenes were reported by Cao, Meier, and coworkers in 2009 when they investigated macrocyclization of 2,5-
bis(alkoxymethyl)-1,4-diethoxybenzene (Scheme 4b, path I).57
However, pillar[6]arenes were obtained as minor products even
under optimized conditions (yield 11%). In 2012, the same
group developed a facile method for the synthesis of pillar[6]-
arenes (Scheme 5a).59
Pillar[6]arenes were obtained as a mixture of pillar[5]- and
pillar[6]arenes using 1,4-dialkoxybenzenes as monomers, FeCl3
as catalyst, and chloroform as solvent. The highest yields of
pillar[6]arenes 5[6] and 6[6] were 45% by this method. Zhang et
al. reported the synthesis of pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes with
high selectivity using choline chloride/FeCl3 deep eutectic
solvent in CH2Cl2. The yields of pillar[5]arene (2[5]) and
pillar[6]arene (1[6]) were 35% and 53%, respectively, under the
optimized conditions (Scheme 5b).60 In their investigation,
FeCl3 was determined to be optimal to produce pillar[6]arenes.
Therefore, we proposed that FeCl3 would be effective for the
formation of pillar[6]arenes, although another Lewis acid and
hydrochloric acid can also be used for the synthesis of
pillar[6]arenes. Hou et al. reported the reaction of 1,4-
diethoxybenzene with paraformaldehyde in the presence of
BF
3OEt2 in chloroform afforded pillar[6]arene 1[6] (yield 15%)
along with various other pillar[n]arene homologues (Scheme
5c).61 In these methods, pillar[6]arenes were contained in the
mixture of pillar[n]arene homologues, indicating that the macrocyclization proceeded under kinetic control. As shown in
Table 1, the type of solvent is key for pillar[5]arene synthesis
under thermodynamic control; thus we investigated several
reaction solvents that are able to fit into the pillar[6]arene cavity
to act as a template solvent for pillar[6]arene synthesis under
thermodynamic control. Pillar[6]arenes accommodate bulky
hydrocarbons because the cavity size of pillar[6]arenes is larger
than that of pillar[5]arene (see details in section 5). Therefore,
we envisioned that bulky hydrocarbons should act as a template
solvent for the synthesis of pillar[6]arenes. When chlorocyclohexane was used as the solvent (Scheme 6), pillar[6]arene 7[6]
was obtained as the major product in high yield (87%), and
pillar[5]arene 11[5] was the minor product (3%).62
The reaction was monitored by 1H NMR (Figure 4a). In the
initial stage within 1 min, the monomer reacted with
paraformaldehyde and afforded a linear oligomer. These linear
oligomers were subsequently converted to pillar[6]arene as the
reaction time increased (Figure 4b). These results indicate that
pillar[6]arene 7[6] is the thermodynamically stable compound
in the reaction system, and that the reaction proceeds under
reversible dynamic covalent bond formation between linear
oligomers, pillar[5]-, and pillar[6]arenes. To clarify the dynamic
covalent bond formation, we investigated dynamic interconversion between pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes depending on the
type of solvent (Figure 5).
Reaction of pillar[5]arene 11[5] with BF3OEt2 in chlorocyclohexane, which is a good template solvent for the synthesis
of pillar[6]arene, resulted in the formation of pillar[6]arene 7[6]
(Figure 5b). However, pillar[6]arene 7[6] converted to
pillar[5]arene 11[5] with BF3OEt2 in 1,2-dichloroethane,
which is a template solvent for pillar[5]arenes (Figure 5a).
These experiments indicate that pillar[n]arenes were produced
by dynamic covalent bond formations.62 Nierengarten et al. also
observed that macrocyclization proceeded by dynamic covalent
chemistry while they were investigating favorable synthetic
procedures for the production of pillar[6]arenes (Scheme 7).58
To synthesize pillar[6]arenes, they investigated the cocyclization of different monomers, 2,5-bis(bromomethyl)-1,4-diethoxybenzene and 1,4-diethoxybenzene, with a Lewis acid (Scheme
7a). However, the major product obtained was not pillar[6]arene
but pillar[5]arene. Pillar[5]arene was also obtained upon
macrocyclization of the trimer by reaction of paraformaldehyde
with Lewis acid (Scheme 7b). These results clearly indicate that the formation of pillar[n]arenes proceeded under dynamic
covalent bond formation.
Recently, Zyryanov and co-workers reported the selective
synthesis of pillar[6]arenes by solid-state condensation of 1,4-
dialkoxybenzene and paraformaldehyde by grinding in the
presence of a catalytic amount of H2SO4.63 The highest yield
of pillar[6]arene was 85% by this method; thus, the procedure
will be a new useful route for the synthesis of pillar[6]arenes.


2.4. Formation of Pillar[n]arenes (n ≥ 7) under Kinetic
Control
Larger pillar[n]arene homologues (n ≥ 7) were first synthesized
by Hou and co-workers.61 They used 1,4-diethoxybenzene as a
monomer, chloroform as a solvent, and BF3OEt2 as a Lewis acid
(Scheme 8).
Chloroform cannot act as a template for the particular
pillar[n]arene homologues. Therefore, the reaction in chloroform afforded not only pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes as major
products but also larger pillar[n]arene homologues as minor
products, pillar[7]arene 1[7], pillar[8]arene 1[8], pillar[9]arene
1[9], and pillar[10]arene 1[10] in 3%, 1%, 2%, and 2% yields,
respectively. The optimized reaction time for the synthesis of
larger pillar[n]arene homologues was 20 min. When the reaction
time was longer, the larger pillar[n]arene homologues (n ≥ 7)
disappeared completely. This result indicates the reaction
proceeded under kinetic control. Our group also synthesized
larger pillar[n]arene homologues using dynamic covalent bond
formation of pillar[n]arenes (Scheme 9).64
We used pillar[5]arene as a monomer, and chloroform as a
solvent. Again, it should be noted that chloroform did not act as a
template solvent. Therefore, the reaction afforded a kinetically
stable mixture of pillar[n]arene homologues (n = 5−15). Heating
at 50 °C was necessary to promote ring-opening reaction of
pillar[5]arene 2[5], and the optimized reaction time to produce a
mixture of pillar[n]arene homologues (n = 5−15) was 1 h. New
larger pillar[n]arene homologues (n = 11−13) were isolated with
known pillar[n]arene homologues (n = 5−10) by silica gel
chromatography. Both Hou and our protocols were carried out
under kinetic control; thus, yields of larger pillar[n]arene
homologues were quite low. One of the next challenges is the
synthesis of larger pillar[n]arene homologues under thermodynamically controlled conditions to selectively produce larger
pillar[n]arene homologues in high yields.


3. FUNCTIONALIZATION OF PILLAR[n]ARENES
Substituents on both rims of pillar[n]arenes affect their physical
properties such as solubility, conformational, and host−guest
properties. Therefore, functionalization of pillar[n]arenes is a
very important feature in pillar[n]arene chemistry. Pillar[n]arene
homologues (n = 5−13) have been synthesized, but the
functionalization of cyclic pentamers, pillar[5]arenes, has been mainly investigated because pillar[5]arenes are obtained in high
yields by thermodynamic control using template solvents as
compared to the other pillar[n]arene homologues (n ≥ 6). From
2012, simple pillar[6]arenes have been obtained in moderate
yields (>40%).59 Therefore, the functionalization of pillar[6]-
arenes has recently been investigated. Pillar[n]arenes have two
functional groups in the constituent unit; therefore, pillar[5]- and
pillar[6]arenes have 10 and 12 functional groups, respectively. As
compared to per- and monofunctionalized pillar[n]arenes,
multifunctionalization of pillar[n]arenes, such as di-, tri-, tetra-,
and penta-functionalized pillar[n]arenes, is quite difficult as
multifunctionalized pillar[n]arenes have many constitutional
isomers. Figure 6a shows the assignment of the substituent
positions in pillar[5]arene.
The letters and numbers refer to the dialkoxybenzene units,
and the upper and lower rims, respectively. Difunctionalized
pillar[5]arenes have five isomers (Figure 6b, A1/A2, A1/B2, A1/
C2, A1/B1, and A1/C1). The number of isomers increases as the
increase of the substituent numbers. There are 10 constitutional
isomers in trifunctionalized pillar[5]arenes (A1/B1/C1, A1/B1/
D1, A1/B1/C2, A1/B1/D2, A1/A2/B1, A1/A2/B2, A1/A2/C1,
A1/A2/C2, A1/B2/C1, and A1/B2/D1). Therefore, selective
synthesis of multifunctionalized pillar[n]arenes is one of the
challenging topics in pillar[n]arene chemistry. Position-selective
functionalization of pillar[5]arenes has been intensively
investigated by pillar[n]arene chemists, and their efforts have
contributed to the successful synthesis of position-selective
multifunctionalized pillar[5]arenes based on various organic
reaction methods. Position-selective mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-,
penta-, and per-functionalization of pillar[5]arenes have been
achieved.37,38 Two approaches have been devised for the
synthesis of position selective-functionalizing pillar[n]arenes:
(i) exchange of the substituents by deprotection followed by
etherification of preformed pillar[n]arenes and (ii) cyclization of
1,4-dialkoxybenzene with another 1,4-dialkoxybenzene derivative with functional groups.


3.1. Deprotection of the Alkoxy Moieties of Pillar[n]arenes
To Produce Key Pillar[n]arenes Bearing Phenolic Groups at
Specific Positions
Deprotection of alkoxy groups to produce functionalizing
pillar[5]arenes was first investigated by our group in 2008.33
Phenolic groups, which are obtained by deprotection of alkoxy
groups, are favorable reactive groups for the introduction of
various functional groups. Therefore, pillar[n]arenes with
phenolic groups at the desired positions are useful key
compounds to produce various functionalizing pillar[n]arenes.
We investigated the deprotection of methoxy groups in permethylated pillar[5]arene 1[5]. Deprotection of the methoxy
moieties of 1[5] with excess BBr3 afforded per-hydroxylated
pillar[5]arene 12[5], quantitatively (Scheme 10a).33
However, deprotection of per-methylated pillar[5]arene 1[5]
with 0.9 equiv of BBr3 under the optimized reaction time
afforded monohydroxylated pillar[5]arene 13[5] in moderate
yield (22%, Scheme 10b).65 Cao et al. optimized the reaction
conditions to provide the mono-ol 13[5] in good yield (60%).66
The effect of the amounts of BBr3 and reaction temperature on
the deprotection reaction was further investigated by Stoddart
and co-workers.67 They found that deprotection of methoxy
groups of preformed per-methylated pillar[5]arene 1[5] with
BBr
3 occurred in a stepwise manner at low temperatures under
kinetic control (Scheme 10c and d). Therefore, conversion to
mono-, di-, and trideprotected pillar[5]arenes can be controlled
by reaction temperature, time, and the feed ratio between
pillar[5]arene and BBr3. The introduction of triflate groups into
the phenolic moieties of the mixture of multideprotected
pillar[5]arenes resulted in the separation of monotriflated 14[5], ditriflated, and tritriflated pillar[5]arene isomers by silica
gel chromatography. Modification of the triflate groups enabled
easy separation of these isomers by silica gel chromatography.
New pillar[5]arene isomers, A1/B1 (15[5]) and A1/C2 (16[5])
ditriflates, and A1/B1/D1 (17[5]) and A1/B2/D1 (18[5])
tritriflates, can be produced by the protocol. They named this
method the deprotection followed by activation strategy.
The other deprotection method is the oxidation followed by
reduction strategy of preformed per-alkylated pillar[5]arenes to
produce A1/A2 dihydroxylated pillar[5]arenes and A1/A2/B1/
B2, A1/A2/C1/C2 tetra-hydroxylated pillar[5]arenes (Scheme
11).68,69
Oxidation of a 1,4-dialkoxybenzene unit in per-alkylated
pillar[5]arenes afforded pillar[5]arenes with a benzoquinone
unit (19[5] and 20[5]). Benzoquinone was easily converted to
hydroquinone using a reducing agent; thus, the A1/A2
dihydroxylated pillar[5]arenes (25[5] and 26[5]) were obtained
by reduction of the benzoquinone unit.68,69 The merit of the
oxidation followed by reduction method is that pillar[5]arenes
with two phenolic groups at the A1 and A2 positions can be
selectively produced. When BBr3 was used to produce
dihydroxylated pillar[5]arenes, the product was a mixture of
multideprotected pillar[5]arenes; therefore, separation of
dihydroxylated pillar[5]arene isomers from the mixture was
quite difficult. Furthermore, pillar[5]arenes with two benzoquinone units at the A/B (21[5] and 22[5]) and A/C (23[5] and
24[5]) units can be prepared under the optimized oxidation
condition, and reduction of these pillar[5]arenes with two
benzoquinone units led to A1/A2/B1/B2 (27[5] and 28[5])
and A1/A2/C1/C2 (29[5] and 30[5]) tetra-hydroxylated
pillar[5]arenes.68 Tuning the oxidation condition enables the
synthesis of pillar[5]arenes with three and four quinone moieties.
Xue et al. reported the synthesis of pillar[5]arenes consisting of
three different kinds of units by selective oxidation of the units
(Scheme 12).70,71
They found the functional group-selective oxidation. Ether
benzene units are oxidized by an oxidizing agent, but benzene
units with ester moieties are not. Installation of ester groups into
A1/A2/C1/C2 tetra-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene afforded
pillar[5]arene with four ester groups at A1/A2/C1/C2 positions
(31[5]). Using the functional group-selective oxidation between
ether and ester groups, complex pillar[5]arene derivatives
consisting of two ester units and one (32[5]), two (33[5]),
and three (34[5]) benzoquinone units could be produced.
The advantages of these deprotection methods are as follows.
(1) The methods can be used for pillar[5]arenes even with
functional substituents such as tri(ethylene oxide) moieties.72
(2) The method can be used for larger pillar[n]arene
homologues (n ≥ 6). Per-hydroxylated pillar[n]arenes (n = 6,
7, 9, and 10) were synthesized by deprotection of ethoxy moieties
with excess BBr3 (Scheme 13a).73−77 Monohydroxylated
pillar[6]arene 9[6] was also obtained in moderate yield (46%)
by the deprotection method (Scheme 13b).78
A1/A2 dihydroxylated pillar[6]arene 11[6] was also produced
by the oxidation followed by reduction method (Scheme 13c).68


3.2. Cocyclization Method To Produce Key Pillar[n]arene
Derivatives Bearing Reactive Groups at Specific Positions
The other method to produce pillar[n]arenes with reactive
functional groups, such as bromo and alkyne groups, is
cyclization of 1,4-dialkoxybenzenes with these functional groups.
Nierengarten and co-workers developed the macrocyclization
procedure using 1,4-dialkoxybenzene monomers with two bromide moieties to produce pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes with
10 bromides 35[5] and 12 bromides 12[6], respectively, in
moderate yields (Scheme 14a).79
Using FeCl3 as a Lewis acid and chloroform as a solvent under
the optimized reaction condition afforded a mixture of
decabromide 35[5] and dodecabromide 12[6]. A pillar[5]arene
with 10 alkyne groups (36[5]) can be obtained by macrocyclization of a monomer with two alkyne groups (Scheme
14b).80
Cocyclization of two kinds of 1,4-dialkoxybenzene monomers
allowed mono-, di-, and tetra-functionalized pillar[5]arenes.
Cocyclization was first developed by Huang et al. (Scheme 15).81
Cocyclization of two different 1,4-dialkoxybenzenes with
dimethoxy, dibutoxy, and dioctyloxy groups afforded pillar[5]-
arenes containing a different 1,4-dialkoxybenzene unit (37[5]
and 38[5]). Monoreactive pillar[5]arene was first introduced by
Stoddart and co-workers based on the cocyclization method.82
Co-pillar[5]arene 39[5], in which are one 2-bromoethoxy and
nine methoxy groups, was prepared by cocyclization of 1,4-
dimethoxybenzene and nonsymmetric dialkoxybenzene with one
bromide group. Tuning the feed ratio between the two different
monomers was very important for the efficient synthesis of the
monobromide 39[5], which was developed by Cao and Meier et
al.83 Wang et al. applied the cocyclization method to obtain a A1/
A2 dibromo-functionalized pillar[5]arene 40[5].84 Cocyclization of 1,4-bis(2-bromoethoxy)benzene with 1,4-dialkoxybenzene afforded dibromide 40[5]. Tetra-functionalized pillar[5]-
arenes with four bromides can also be produced by tuning the
feed ratio of different monomers in the cocyclization method.85
The cocyclization method is a useful approach to obtain useful
key pillar[n]arenes with bromide groups at desired positions by a
one-step reaction, but is limited because the functional groups in
the monomers sometimes inhibit the macrocyclization. In
addition, the cocyclization cannot be used for the synthesis of
functionalizing pillar[n]arenes with larger homologues (n ≥ 6) in
many cases because these larger pillar[n]arene homologues are
only obtained as minor products under kinetically controlled
processes. It is necessary to use both the deprotection and the
cocyclization methods depending on the type of functional
groups in the monomer and targeting numbers of rings.


3.3. Combination of Deprotection and Cocyclization
Methods To Produce Key Pillar[n]arene Derivatives with
Phenolic Groups
Combination of the cocyclization and deprotection methods also
affords useful key pillar[5]arenes. First, dihydroxylated pillar[5]-
arene was accidentally obtained by our group in macrocyclization
of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene using different Lewis acids.86 For the
synthesis of pillar[5]arenes, BF3OEt2 was a good Lewis acid in
many cases to produce pillar[5]arenes in good yields.33 However,
the deprotection reaction of methoxy groups took place
concurrently with macrocyclization when AlBr3 was used as a
Lewis acid. AlBr3 acts as a Lewis acid for both macrocyclization
and deprotection of the methoxy groups. A regioselective A1/B2
dihydroxylated pillar[5]arene 41[5] could be isolated by silica
gel chromatography and washing with methanol (Scheme 16a).
Stoddart et al. reported the synthesis of A1/A2 hydroxylated
pillar[5]arene 25[5] by the cocyclization followed by deprotection method (Scheme 16b).87 The A1/A2 dibromo-functionalized pillar[5]arene 42[5] was first synthesized by cocyclizationof 1,4-bis(3-bromopropoxy)benzene with 1,4-dimethoxybenzene. Elimination of bromide moieties in 42[5] resulted in the
A1/A2 diallylated pillar[5]arene 43[5]. Deprotection of the allyl
groups afforded A1/A2 dihydroxylated pillar[5]arene 25[5].



3.4. Functionalization of Pillar[n]arenes Bearing Phenolic
Groups by Etherification
Pillar[n]arenes with phenolic groups at desired positions could
be produced by various methods, such as deprotection, oxidation
followed by reduction method of preformed pillar[5]arenes, and
in situ macrocyclization and deprotection, and the cocyclization
followed by deprotection method. Pillar[n]arenes with phenolic
groups are very important key compounds, because etherification
between the pillar[n]arenes and alkyl-halide in the presence of
appropriate bases can afford various functionalizing pillar[n]-
arenes. Various per-functionalized pillar[5]arenes have been
synthesized by etherification (Scheme 17).
The first water-soluble pillar[5]arene with 10 carboxylate
anions 46[5] was introduced by our group.88 A pillar[5]arene
with 10 esters groups 44[5] was synthesized by installing 10 ester
groups through etherification. Hydrolysis of the deca-ester 44[5]
afforded the first water-soluble pillar[5]arene 46[5]. Hou et al.
reported that 44[5] converted to a water-soluble pillar[5]arene
with 10 amine groups 49[5].89 Our group reported that synthesis
of pillar[5]arenes with nonionic moieties, such as ethylene oxide
50[5] and tri(ethylene oxide) groups 51[5] by etherification.90
Pillar[5]arene with 10 tri(ethylene oxide) 51[5] was completely
soluble in aqueous media, but pillar[5]arene with 10 ethylene
oxide 50[5] was insoluble, indicating that the long water-soluble
moieties are necessary to gain water solubility. Pillar[5]arene
with 10 cyclohexylmethyl moieties 11[5] was also synthesized by
etherification.91 The other method to functionalize pillar[n]-
arene is by palladium-catalyzed reactions, such as Sonogashira,
Suzuki, and Heck reactions, which have been widely used for the
synthesis of π-conjugated molecules and polymers. A reactive
intermediate pillar[5]arene with 10 triflate groups 52[5] was
synthesized by reaction of per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5]
and Tf2O. Sonogashira coupling between the decatriflate 52[5]
and ethynylbenzene afforded a highly π-conjugated pillar[5]-
arene 53[5], which exhibited through-space π-delocalization.92
The etherification protocol is a straightforward and reliable
process, and thus is applicable for the functionalization of larger
pillar[n]arene homologues (n ≥ 6, Scheme 18).
As with per-functionalization of pillar[5]arenes by esterification, water-soluble pillar[n]arenes with carboxylate anions
(13[6], 3[7], 3[9], and 3[10]),74−76,93 and amphiphilic
pillar[n]arenes with ethylene oxide and tri(ethylene oxide)
moieties (14[6], 15[6], 4[7], and 4[10]),90,93−97 have been
synthesized from per-hydroxylated pillar[n]arenes.
Monofunctionalized pillar[5]arenes with one trimethylammonium 54[5],65 DABCO cation 55[5],78 and phosphoryl groups
56[5]66 were accessable by etherification of monohydroxylated
pillar[5]arene 13[5] with the corresponding monohalides
(Scheme 19).
As compared to the cocyclization method, this approach
required multistep reactions to produce the monofunctionalized
pillar[n]arenes, but can be used for the synthesis of the larger
homologues (n ≥ 6) of monofunctionalized pillar[n]arenes. In
an approach similar to that for the production of monofunction alized pillar[5]arenes, monofunctionalized pillar[6]arene with a
pyridinium cation 16[6] was produced by etherification.78
Pillar[5]arene with two functional groups can also be
produced by etherification. Pillar[5]arene with two carboxylic
acid groups 57[5] was prepared by the modification of two ester
groups by etherification, followed by hydrolysis of an ester bond
(Scheme 20).98
Introduction of a π-conjugated unit into pillar[5]arenes can be
achieved by the palladium-catalyzed reaction. The A1/A2
ditriflate 58[5] was prepared from A1/A2 dihydroxylated
pillar[5]arene, as reported by Stoddart et al., to produce a terphenyl substituted pillar[5]arene 60[5].87 In a similar approach,
our group also synthesized a pillar[5]arene incorporating π-
conjugated units 61[5] between A1/A2 ditriflate 59[5] and (5-
bithienyl)boronic acid by palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling.99
Stoddart et al. successfully introduced two bromide groups at the
ortho positions (A1′ and A2′) 62[5] by bromination of 25[5].100
The dibromide 62[5] can be functionalized by palladiumcatalyzed coupling reactions, and thus is a useful key compound
to produce difunctionalized pillar[5]arenes at the A1′ and A2′
positions.


3.5. Functionalization of Pillar[n]arenes Bearing Bromide
Groups by Etherification, Cationation, and Amination
Pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes with bromide moieties, which can
be produced by cyclization of 1,4-dialkoxybenzene with two
bromide groups (Scheme 14), are good key compounds because
various per-functionalized pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes were
accessible by cationation and etherification (Scheme 21).
Reaction of the decabromides and dodecabromide with
pyridine,101 1-methylimidazole,102,103 amine,104 and tributylphosphine105 afforded cationic pillar[5]arenes 65[5]−68[5] and
pillar[6]arene 18[6]. Etherification of the decabromide 64[5]
and coumarin derivative with phenolic moiety gave a pillar[5]-
arene with 10 coumarin moieties 69[5].106
The monobromide 39[5] and dibromide 40[5], which are
prepared by cocyclization method (Scheme 15), were converted
to monoamine 70[5] and diamine 71[5], respectively, by Gabriel
synthesis (Scheme 22).84,107
Mono- 72[5] and diureidopyrimidinone 73[5] were synthesized from the monoamine 70[5] and A1/A2 diamine 71[5],
respectively.
3.6. Functionalized Pillar[n]arenes from Pillar[n]arenes
Bearing Alkyne and Azide Groups by the
Copper(I)-Catalyzed Huisgen Alkyne−Azide 1,3-Dipolar
Cycloaddition Reaction
Reaction between azides and alkynes with copper(I), the
copper(I)-catalyzed Huisgen alkyne−azide 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC reaction), is a very efficient and quick
reaction.108 Pillar[n]arenes with azide moieties are easily
accessible from pillar[n]arenes with bromide groups. Bromide
groups in pillar[n]arenes are converted to azide groups by
reaction of bromide moieties in pillar[n]arenes with sodium
azide. These pillar[n]arenes with azide groups are useful key
compounds because CuAAC reaction of these azides with alkyne
derivatives affords various functionalizing pillar[n]arenes.
Nierengarten and co-workers synthesized pillar[5]- and
pillar[6]arenes with azide groups. The CuAAC reaction of the
decaazide and dodecaazide with corresponding alkyne derivatives afforded pillar[n]arenes with mesogens (75[5] and 20[6])
and mannose moieties 76[5] (Scheme 23).79,109
Pei et al. synthesized a pillar[5]arene with 10 ferrocene
moieties 77[5] by CuAAC reaction between decaazide and
ferrocene with an alkyne moiety.110
Per-alkynylated pillar[5]arene 36[5] is also a useful key
compound because CuAAC reaction of per-alkynylated pillar[5]-
arene with monoazide derivatives afforded per-functionalized
pillar[5]arenes. The decaalkyne 36[5] was accessible by not only
etherification of preformed per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene
12[5] with propargyl bromide111 but also macrocyclization of
dialkoxybenzene monomer with two alkyne groups (Scheme
14b).80
Reaction of decaalkyne 36[5] with azide derivatives such as
hexylazide, benzylazide, phenylazide, naphthylazide, pyrenylazide, oligo(ethylene oxide), and cationic dendrons with an azide
moiety afforded various per-functionalizing pillar[5]arenes with
corresponding functional groups 78[5]−84[5] (Scheme
24).80,111−114
Reaction of the copillar[5]arene with one bromide group
39[5] with sodium azide produced a copillar[5]arene with an
azide group 85[5]. The monoazide 85[5] was an important key
compound to synthesize monofunctionalized pillar[5]arenes
through the CuAAC reaction (Scheme 25).82
Monofunctionalized pillar[5]arenes with pyrene 86[5],82
azobenzene 87[5],115 viologen 88[5],116 and fluorescein 89-
[5]117 were produced by the CuAAC reaction of the monoazide
85[5] with the corresponding monoalkynes.
The A1/A2 dialkyne 90[5] and A1/A2/C1/C2 tetra-alkyne
91[5] were produced by etherification of A1/A2 diol 26[5] and
A1/A2/C1/C2 pentanol 30[5] with propargyl bromide. The
dialkyne and tetraalkyne can be reacted with pyrene with an azide
moiety through the CuAAC reaction to afford a pillar[5]arene
with two 92[5] and four pyrenyl moieties 93[5] (Scheme 26).68 Thus, the dialkyne 90[5] and tetraalkyne 91[5] are useful key
compounds to produce various A1/A2 di- and A1/A2/C1/C2
tetra-functionalized pillar[5]arenes.
Yang and co-workers synthesized an A1/A2 difunctionalized
pillar[5]arene with a bromide and an alkyne moiety at the A1 and
A2 positions 94[5] by cocyclization of a nonsymmetric
dialkoxybenzene monomer possessing a bromide and an alkyne
group with 1,4-dialkoxybenzene (Scheme 27).118
An anthracene moiety can be installed in 94[5] using the
CuAAC reaction between the alkyne moiety and an anthracene
derivative with an azide group. The reaction between the
bromide moiety in 95[5] and dimethylamine then afforded a
pillar[5]arene with an anthracene and a cationic moiety at the A1
and A2 positions 96[5]. Combination of CuAAC and another
reaction expands the functionality of pillar[5]arenes.


3.7. Pillar[5]arene Dimers, Tetramers, and Pentamers from
Monoreactive Pillar[5]arenes
Monofunctionalized pillar[n]arenes are useful building blocks to
produce molecules containing more than one pillar[n]arene,
such as dimers, trimers, and tetramers. Our group synthesized a
pillar[5]arene dimer 97[5] by connecting the monohydroxylated
pillar[5]arenes 13[5] with 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene
(Scheme 28).119
The other pillar[5]arene dimers (98[5] and 99[5])
connecting the monohydroxylated pillar[5]arene molecules by
other linkers, such as 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene and 1,4-
diiodobutane, were synthesized by Li, Jia, and co-workers.120 An
azobenzene bridged pillar[5]arene dimer 101[5] was synthesized by the CuAAC reaction between monoalkyne-functionalized pillar[5]arene 100[5] and azobenzene with two azide
moieties.121 Yang et al. and Yu et al. synthesized pillar[5]arene
dimer 104[5] and tetramer 105[5] by etherification of di- and
tetra-ol compounds with monobromides (102[5] and 103[5]),
respectively, which were produced by cocyclization of 1,4-
dimethoxybenzene and 1,4-dialkoxybenzene with one bromide
group (Scheme 29).122−124
Reaction between the monobromide 102[5] and NaSeSeNa
afforded a pillar[5]arene dimer linked by an Se−Se bond
106[5].125 A pillar[5]arene with an azide moiety 107[5], which
was produced by reaction of monobromide 102[5] and sodium
azide, is also a good key compound to produce pillar[n]arene
oligomers. CuAAC reaction of di- and tetra-alkynes with
pillar[5]arenes possessing an azide moiety 107[5] produced a
pillar[5]arene dimer 108[5] and a tetramer.126,127 The other
process for the synthesis of pillar[5]arene dimers is the
cocyclization method. Huang et al. and Xiao, Jiang et al. synthesized pillar[5]arene dimers by cocyclization of 1,4-
dimethoxybenzene monomer with dimeric monomer, in which
two monomers are connected by flexible aliphatic chains.128,129
3.8. Penta-functionalization of Pillar[n]arenes
Penta-functionalized pillar[5]arenes can be synthesized by
macrocyclization of nonsymmetric dialkoxybenzene monomers.
However, four constitutional isomers are formed by macrocyclization (Scheme 30).
This is a serious problem because isolation of these conformers
is quite difficult by silica gel chromatography. Among these
isomers, the highly symmetric C5-isomer shows a rim-different
structure; thus it should be useful for various applications.
However, yields of the C5-symmetric isomers were quite low. Our group reported the first nonsymmetrical pillar[5]arene
109a−d[5] by cyclization of nonsymmetrical dialkoxybenzene
monomer, 1-ethoxy-4-methoxybenzene.130 However, we could
not separate four isomers 109a−d[5]. Huang et al. and Meier et
al. successfully isolated the nonsymmetrical pillar[5]arene
isomers 110a−d[5], which are composed of 1-butoxy-4-
methoxybenzene units, by silica gel chromatography, but the
yield of the C5-symmetric isomer 110a[5] was quite low
(Scheme 30, 6%).131,132
Huang et al. developed a C5-symmetric pillar[5]arene with five
functional groups by the CuAAC reaction.133 First, they
produced a nonsymmetric pillar[5]arene containing four isomers
111a−d[5] by macrocyclization of the nonsymmetrical monomer, 1,4-dialkoxybenzene with an alkyne group. These isomers
could not be separated because separation of these isomers was quite difficult. The CuAAC reaction between a mixture of the
isomers 111a−d[5] and a naphthalene containing an azide
moiety afforded pillar[5]arene isomers 112a−d[5] with five
naphthalene moieties. A C5-symmetric isomer 112a[5] was
successfully isolated from the other isomers by silica gel
chromatography. Modification of naphthalene moieties contributes to the easy separation of the target compound C5-symmetric
isomer. The same group also discovered isolation of the C5-
symmetric isomer by recrystallization. Macrocyclization of the
nonsymmetric monomer with an ester group afforded a mixture
of pillar[5]arene isomers 113a−d[5] (Scheme 31).134
Isolation of the C5-symmetric pillar[5]arene 113a[5] was
achieved by recrystallization of a mixture of the isomers. Because
the C5-symmetric isomers cannot be selectively formed in these
methods, yields of the C5-symmetric isomers were low. Selective
synthesis of the C5-symmetric isomer is one of the next
challenging topics in pillar[n]arene chemistry.


4. STRUCTURE OF PILLAR[n]ARENES
4.1. X-ray Crystal Structures of Simple Pillar[n]arene
Homologues
One of the important features of pillar[n]arenes is their structure.
We were the first to report the X-ray crystal structure of cyclic
pentamer pillar[n]arenes, pillar[5]arene with 10 methoxy groups
1[5] (Figure 7a).33
Pillar[5]arene 1[5] showed a completely symmetric cylindrical structure from the side view, and a highly symmetrical
regular pentagonal structure from the top view. 1,4-Dimethoxybenzene units consisting of 1[5] were connected by methylene
linkages at the 2- and 5-positions (para-positions). The position
of the methylene bridge linkage contributed to these highly
symmetrical structures. On the basis of the highly symmetric
pillars that constitute the Parthenon in Athens, we named this
type of paracyclophane “pillar[n]arenes”. The first X-ray crystal
structure of cyclic hexamer, pillar[6]arene with 12 diisobutoxy
groups 3[6], was reported by Huang and co-workers.135 The
same group also reported the X-ray crystal structure of
pillar[6]arene with 12 propoxy groups 2[6] (Figure 7b).136
2[6] has a hexagonal-like cyclic structure from the top view.
From the side view, as with pillar[5]arene 1[5], pillar[6]arene
2[6] has a highly symmetrical structure. X-ray crystal structures
of pillar[8]-, pillar[9]-, and pillar[10]arenes were first reported
by Hou and co-workers (Figure 8),61 while that of pillar[7]arene has not been reported because pillar[7]arenes would have a low
symmetry structure.
These larger pillar[n]arenes have two cavities, while pillar[5]-
and pillar[6]arenes have a single pentagonal and hexagonal
cavity, respectively. Pillar[8]arene with 16 ethoxy groups 1[8]
have two pentagonal cavities. From the top view of the X-ray
crystal structure of pillar[9]arene with 18 ethoxy groups 1[9],
one pentagonal and one hexagonal cavity were observed.
Pillar[10]arene with 20 ethoxy groups 1[10] have two hexagonal
cavities. To reduce the ring strain, they should have two cavities.
The same trend was also reported in calix[n]arene chemistry.
Calix[8]arene has two tetragonal calix-shaped cavities because
the tetragonal calix-shape is the most stable structure.137 As with
pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes, these larger pillar[n]arenes exhibit
a highly symmetrical pillar-shaped structure from their side
views


4.2. Conformational and Planar Chirality Characteristics of
Pillar[n]arenes
From the viewpoint of conformational mobility, macrocyclic
molecules are divided into two categories: conformationally fixed
and conformationally flexible. Calix[n]arenes and crown ethers
are assigned as conformationally flexible macrocyclic compounds. For example, calix[4]arenes have four conformational
isomers: cone, partial cone, 1,2-alternate, and 1,3-alternate. In
contrast, CB[n]s are conformationally fixed macrocyclic
compounds because their units are connected by double
methylene bridges.
Pillar[n]arenes are assigned as conformationally flexible
macrocyclic compounds because their benzene units can rotate
around 180° (Figure 9a).
The pillar[n]arene constituent units are composed of two
substituents at the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene units. Therefore, pillar[n]arenes have conformational isomers resulting
from rotation of the benzene units. Pillar[5]arenes have an odd
number of constituent units (five); therefore, they have four
diastereomers (Figure 9b, a, b, c, and d): Diastereomer a has C5
symmetry, while the other three diastereomers (b, c, and d) have
C2 symmetry. Furthermore, they have the corresponding
enantiomers (a′, b′, c′, and d′). Thus, pillar[5]arenes have a
total of eight conformers.138 In the case of pillar[6]arenes, they
have an even number of constituent units (six); therefore, they
have five diastereomers (Figure 9c, a, b, c, d, e) and three meso
forms (f, g, h). a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h forms are assigned with C6,
C1, C2, C2, D2, Cs, C3v, and C2h symmetries, respectively.
Furthermore, a, b, c, d, and e forms have the corresponding
enantiomers (a′, b′, c′, d′, and e′). Therefore, there are a total of
13 conformers in pillar[6]arenes.139 These conformers are
interconverted by rotation of the benzene units of pillar[n]arenes
because the rotation of the benzene unit leads to the positional
changes of the substituents.
The conformational structure in the crystal state is a
“snapshot” of one of the conformations of pillar[n]arenes, but
this structure will be the most stable conformation of
pillar[n]arenes. From the X-ray crystal structure of simple
alkyl-substituted pillar[n]arenes, shown in Figures 7 and 8, their
structures exhibit C
n symmetry, indicating that Cn symmetric
structures are most stable among all possible conformers. The
possible reason for this is that there are no strong interactions
between neighboring units in per-alkylated pillar[n]arenes.
Simple alkyl-substituted pillar[n]arenes form Cn symmetric a
and a′ conformations to reduce the steric hindrance between the
alkyl substituents. Figure 10 shows the energy diagrams of permethylated pillar[5]arene 1[5] conformers obtained from
calculations.
The C5-symmetric conformers a/a′ are the most stable
structures among the 1[5] conformers. However, their
conformation dramatically changed by replacing the substituents
from methoxy to hydroxyl groups. Figure 11 shows the X-ray
crystal structure of per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5].53
Flipping of the two hydroquinone moieties at the A and C
units is observed to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds
between the neighboring units. However, pillar[5]arenes have
an odd number of units; thus hydroquinone moieties at the D
and E units cannot form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Hence,
per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene forms conformational isomers
d/d′ in the solid state. Formation of isomers d/d′ in the frozen
state of 12[5] is also suggested by 1H NMR of 12[5] at low
temperature (Figure 12).138
The proton signals from phenol, phenyl, and the methylene
bridge of per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5] were observed as
singlets at 25 °C. In contrast, the signals broadened around −50
°C, and split as the measurement temperature decreased under
−60 °C. The split signals at low temperature suggest that the
nonsymmetrical diastereomers d/d′ are the most stable
conformers in the case of per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene
12[5]. Peerannawar and Gejji supported the experimental observations with calculations (Figure 10).140 The most stable
diastereomers of per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5] were the
d/d′ conformers, which is the exact opposite result as compared
to the simple per-methylated pillar[5]arene 1[5]. Per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5] forms up-and-down d/d′ conformations to form an intramolecular hydrogen-bond network
between units, while per-methylated pillar[5]arene 1[5] forms
highly regular a/a′ conformations to reduce the steric hindrance
between substituents.



Per-hydroxylated pillar[6]arene 8[6] also formed intramolecular hydrogen bonds between adjacent units; therefore, flipping of hydroquinone moieties at the A, C, and E units was
observed in the X-ray crystal structure of 8[6] (Figure 11).73 The
conformation of 8[6] was assigned as isomer g. Cyclic hexamer,
pillar[6]arenes have an even number of units; thus, the
intramolecular hydrogen-bond network is completely continuous in an alternating up-and-down manner. The relative
stabilization energies of the different conformers, which have
been reported by Gejji and co-workers, supported the X-ray
crystal structure of per-hydroxylated pillar[6]arene 8[6].141 The
meso-form of conformer g is the most stable, and the energies (in
kJ/mol) of the different conformers relative to conformer g are
calculated to be 21.4 (d/d′) < 41.3 (c/c′) < 45.5 (b/b′) < 61.9
(h) < 72.4 (a/a′).
X-ray crystal structures of A1/B2 and A1/A2 dihydroxylated
pillar[5]arenes (41[5] and 25[5]) were reported by our group
and the Stoddart group, respectively.86,87 Flipping of two units
(A and B units) was observed in A1/B2 dihydroxylated
pillar[5]arene 41[5] (Figure 13a).
The flipping occurred to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds
between B and C units, and between A and E units. Therefore,
isomers c/c′ were the most stable conformers in A1/B2
dihydroxylated pillar[5]arene 41[5]. In contrast, in the crystal
structure of A1/A2 dihydroxylated pillar[5]arene 25[5] (Figure
13b), flipping of one hydroquinone unit A was observed to form
intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the A and B units, and
between the A and E units. Therefore, isomers b/b′ were the
most stable in A1/A2 dihydroxylated pillar[5]arene 25[5]. Both
A1/B2 and A1/A2 diols have two phenolic moieties, but the
conformation of the A1/B2 diol is different from that of the A1/
A2 diol, indicating that the position of the phenolic moieties
dominates the most stable conformation of pillar[5]arenes.
Pillar[n]arene enantiomers should be useful compounds for
chiral molecular recognition and catalysts because pillar[n]arene
enantiomers have pores to capture guest molecules. However,
interconversion between isomers occurred by rotation of the
units. To isolate the pillar[n]arene enantiomers, inhibition of the
rotation of the units is necessary. We first synthesized various
lengths of alkyl chains, such as ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl,
and dodecyl chains (1[5]−7[5]), at both rims to inhibit the
rotation of the units.54 Figure 14a shows the rotational barrier of
the units, which was determined by variable-temperature 1H
NMR.
As the length of the alkyl chain increased, the rotational barrier
also increased. However, these substituents were too small to
stop the rotation of the units. Therefore, a pillar[5]arene with 10
bulky cyclohexylmethyl groups 11[5] was produced.91 For
11[5], rotation of the units could not be observed by variable 1H
NMR. Thus, 11[5] was characterized by chiral HPLC (Figure
14b). Two peaks with equal areas were observed by injection of
11[5] into a chiral column, indicating that 11[5] was a mixture of
two enantiomers, and exhibited a rotational barrier to observe
two enantiomers as separated peaks. When the first fraction
collected was reinjected, the original peak was detected but the
pair peak from an enantiomer was not observed. After the first fraction was maintained at 40 °C for 18 h, the second peak was
also not detected, indicating 11[5] did not racemize. The CD
spectra of the first and second fractions were completely mirror
image (Figure 14c), and stable at 25 °C, and the conformation of
the enantiomers determined by 1H NMR was shown to be the
C5-symmetric isomer a/a′. Therefore, we successfully stopped
the rotation of the units, and isolated the enantiomers a and a′ by
introducing bulky cyclohexylmethyl groups at both rims of
pillar[5]arene.



Stoddart et al. reported the separation of enantiomers by
introducing one π-conjugated unit (Figure 15).87
Introduction of bulky monosubstituted phenyl rings at the A1/
A2 positions of pillar[5]arene 60[5] contributes to inhibit the
rotation of the units and separate the a and a′ forms of planar
chiral pillar[5]arenes by chiral column chromatography.
Introduction of bithienyl moieties to the pillar[5]arene at the
A1/A2 positions 61[5] (Scheme 20) also prevented the rotation
of the units, and resulted in the isolation of enantiomers a and a′
by chiral column chromatography.99 Stoddart et al. also
successfully synthesized the planar chiral pillar[5]arenes by the
diastereomer method (Figure 15b).142 First, bulky monosubstituted phenyl rings with chiral resolving agent were introduced
at the A1/A2 positions of pillar[5]arene. The compounds
114[5] are diastereomers; thus, the two diastereomers can be
easily separated by silica gel chromatography. Removal of the
resolving agent afforded 60[5] enantiomers in the a and a′ forms.
Introduction of chiral substituents is another pathway to
induce the planar chirality. We synthesized pillar[5]arene with 10
2(S)-methylbutoxy groups 8[5] (Figure 21).55
The diastereomeric excess (de%) of 8[5] was changed by
solvent, temperature, and inclusion of a guest molecule. The
dynamic planar chirality change will be applied in chiral
molecular recognition and as catalysts (Figure 16).
Enantiomers a and a′ have been successfully isolated, but the
isolation of the other enantiomers has not been accomplished.
The inhibition of units of pillar[6]arenes has not been achieved,
and thus remains another challenging topic. We synthesized
pillar[6]arene with 12 cyclohexylmethyl groups 7[6] to inhibit
the rotation of the pillar[6]arene units (Figure 17).139
However, rotation of the units occurred even after the
introduction of 12 bulky cyclohexylmethyl groups because the
cavity size of pillar[6]arene is larger than that of pillar[5]arene.
Introduction of more bulky substituents would therefore be
necessary to stop the rotation of the units. The other method to
stop the rotation of the units was bridging the even number of
benzene rings in pillar[6]arenes.139 The most stable conformer
of per-hydroxylated pillar[6]arene 8[6] is the g, meso-form C3vsymmetric structure, as determined by X-ray crystal analysis of
8[6] (Figure 11).73 The meso-form pillar[6]arenes were fixed by
bridging units by reaction of adjacent phenolic units of
pillar[6]arene with dialkyldichlorosilanes (Figure 17b, 21[6]
and 22[6]). The bridged pillar[6]arene cavitands are conformationally fixed macrocyclic compounds, and thus should have
superior host−guest ability as compared to conformationally
flexible pillar[6]arenes.


4.3. Assembled Structure of Pillar[n]arenes
Pillar[n]arenes exhibit highly symmetrical structures. Therefore,
clarification of the assembled structures of pillar[n]arene
molecules in the crystal state is an interesting topic, and will
result in the solid-state complexation with guests. Pillar[n]arenes
mainly form three assembled structures in the crystal state: herringbone, one-dimensional channels, and slipped-stacked
structures. The ring size, substituents on the pillar[n]arene rims,
and type of solvent to produce pillar[n]arene crystals dominate
the assembled structures of pillar[n]arenes.
Single crystals of per-methylated pillar[5]arene 1[5], which is
the first pillar[n]arene derivative, were produced by slow
evaporation of its acetonitrile solution. In the crystal structure,
one acetonitrile molecule was incorporated in the cavity of
pillar[5]arene. The complexes were arranged perpendicular to
each other, in a herringbone structure (Figure 18a).33
The one-dimensional channel structure constructed by the
assembly of pillar[5]arenes was first reported by Hou and coworkers.143 Pillar[5]arene with 10 ester moieties 44[5] formed
one-dimensional channels by crystallization from a mixture of
ethylene glycol and chloroform (Figure 18b). Water molecules
were arranged in one-dimensional channels. The slipped-stacked
structure was observed in the crystal of per-hydroxylated
pillar[5]arene 12[5] (Figure 18c). 12[5] formed rigid structures
due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonds between adjacent
units.53 However, because of the odd number of benzene rings,
the decanol cannot form perfect intramolecular hydrogen bonds.
Therefore, the decanol forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds,
which should cause the slipped-stacked structure of 12[5].
Our group found that per-ethylated pillar[5]arene 2[5]
formed two assembled structures depending on the solvents
for crystallization (Figure 19a).144
By crystallization of 2[5] from acetone, their assembled
structure was the herringbone structure. In contrast, onedimensional channels were constructed by crystallization of
2[5] from chloroform under hexane vapor. The type of solvent
included in the cavity of pillar[5]arenes determined the
assembled structure of 2[5]. Danylyuk and Sashuk reported
hydrogen-bonded polymeric chains of pillar[5]arene with 10
carboxylic acid groups 45[5] (Figure 19b).145 Slipped-stacked
structures were observed by crystallization of the 10 carboxylic
acids 45[5] by a 1:1 water−ethanol mixture, but they assembled
into one-dimensional channels by crystallization of 45[5] with
the guest tetracaine hydrochloride. The inclusion of the guest
molecules also changed their assembled structure.



Pillar[n]arene crystal structures can be categorized into three
assembled structures, herringbone, one-dimensional channels,
and slipped-stacked structures, while various pillar[5]arene
crystal structures have been reported. Herringbone assemblies
were observed in per-methylated pillar[5]arenes with one
benzoquinone unit 19[5] crystallized from isopropyl ether,69
one hydroquinone unit 25[5] crystallized from dichloromethane,87 per-ethylated pillar[5]arene 2[5]⊃4-dichlorobutane
complex crystallized from dichloromethane,146 and per-methylated pillar[5]arene 1[5]⊃1,6-dibromohexane complex.146 Perpropylated pillar[5]arene 3[5] crystallized from a mixture of
dichloromethane and acetonitrile,136 pillar[5]arene with 10
triflate moieties 52[5] crystallized from 1,2-dichloroethane,147
pillar[5]arene with one benzoquinone unit 20[5] crystallized
from methanol,68 pillar[5]arene containing one triphenyl unit
60[5] crystallized from DMF under methanol vapor,87 nonsymmetric pillar[5]arene isomers consisting of nonsymmetric
dialkoxybenzene monomer with methoxy and butoxy moieties 10[5],131 and nonsymmetric amphiphilic pillar[5]arene
113a[5] crystallized from a mixture of dichloromethane and
methanol134 assembled into one-dimensional channels. Examples of slipped-stacked structures constructed from the assembly
of pillar[5]arene molecules were per-pentylated pillar[5]arene
5[5] crystallized from acetone,54 per-isobutylated pillar[5]arene
9[5] crystallized from a mixture of dichloromethane and
acetonitrile,135 pillar[5]arenes with two benzoquinones (22[5]
and 24[5]) from a mixture of dichloromethane and acetonitrile,148 and pillar[5]arene with 10 ethylene oxide 50[5]
⊃paraquat complex from a mixture of isopropyl ether and
acetonitrile.149
Assembled structures of pillar[6]arenes are more regular than
those of pillar[5]arenes because pillar[6]arenes are highly
symmetric hexagonal molecules. Huang and co-workers obtained
single crystals of pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes with 10 and 12
diisobutyl moieties (9[5] and 3[6], Figure 20a and b).135
In the case of the pillar[5]arene 9[5], they assembled into
slipped-stacked structures. Considering that pillar[5]arene with
linear propyl groups 3[5] formed one-dimensional channels,136
the branched substituents, such as diisobutyl moieties of the
pillar[5]arene rims, should disturb the one-dimensional channel
assemblies. In contrast, one-dimensional channels formed by the
assembly of pillar[6]arene with 12 diisobutyl moieties 3[6]. The
hexagonal structure of pillar[6]arene should enable ordering of
their assembled structure even though the pillar[6]arene has
bulky 12 diisobutyl groups. One-dimensional channel assemblies
were also observed in per-propylated pillar[6]arene 2[6]
crystallized from a mixture of dichloromethane and acetonitrile,136 per-hydroxylated pillar[6]arene 8[6] and its complex
with paraquat,73 and pillar[6]arene with 12 ethylene oxide
groups 14[6]⊃diquat complex crystallized from a mixture of
isopropyl ether and acetonitrile.96 As the exception, the
assembled structure of pillar[6]arene with one benzoquinone
unit 10[6] formed a slipped-stacked structure by crystallization
from a mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate (Figure
20c).150 A possible reason for this observation is either reduction
of the symmetry of pillar[6]arene by incorporation of one
benzoquinone unit, or intermolecular formation of a chargetransfer complex between benzoquinone and 1,4-dialkoxybenzene units


5. HOST PROPERTY OF PILLAR[n]ARENES
A variety of interactions can be used to form stable host−guest
complexes. Coordination interactions between unpaired electrons and empty electron orbitals, electrostatic interactions
between cationic and anionic groups, and charge-transfer (CT)
interactions between electron donors and acceptors are all
classified in terms of the strength of the physical interactions. In
contrast, van der Waals, π/π, and hydrogen-bonding interactions,
including OH/O, NH/O, CH/O, OH/N, NH/N, CH/N, CH/
π, NH/π, and OH/π interactions, are characterized as weak
physical interactions when they occur in isolation. However,
multiple versions of these weak physical interactions can
effectively enhance host−guest complexation processes in
some cases. All of the physical interactions listed above can
play a role in the host−guest complexation of pillar[n]arenes
because a variety of functional groups can be installed on the rim
of pillar[n]arenes to provide suitable interaction sites for a variety
of guests. In this section, we will discuss the host−guest
complexation process between pillar[n]arenes and guests using
various physical interactions.40,43
5.1. Complexation by Charge-Transfer Interactions
Pillar[n]arenes are composed of electron-donating dialkoxybenzene units and can consequently form host−guest complexes
with electron-accepting molecules. With this in mind, our group
initially investigated these host−guest complexation processes as
CT interactions.33 To enhance the electron-donating ability of
the host molecule, we used pillar[5]arene bearing a series of 5
hydroquinone units 12[5] (Figure 21 and Table 2). Viologen G1 and pyridinium salt G2 were selected as suitable
electron-acceptor guest molecules. The color of the solution
changed from colorless to yellow during the mixing of G1 and
12[5], indicating the formation of a CT complex. In contrast, the
mixing of G2 and 12[5] did not lead to any significant color
changes. The lack of a color change in the latter of these two cases
was attributed to the pyridinium salt G2 being a weaker electron
acceptor than the viologen salt G1. The association constant of
the pyridinium salt G2 with 12[5] (run 2), which was
determined by fluorescence measurements, was 10 times smaller
than that of the viologen salt G1 with 12[5] (run 1). The host
compound 12[5] did not form a host−guest complex with a
viologen salt bearing bulky adamantyl moieties G3 (run 3)
because the adamantyl groups were too bulky to fit into the
pillar[5]arene cavity. Li and co-workers investigated host−guest
complexation abilities of various pyridinium and viologen salts
with the per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5] by UV−vis and
1H NMR spectroscopy.151 In a manner similar to our own results,
the UV−vis spectra of mixtures of the different viologen salts
with 12[5] showed a CT band (about 450 nm), whereas
mixtures that contained dipyridinium guests did not afford a CT
band. The authors of this study also investigated the host−guest
abilities of a series of linear alkyl chains bearing pyridinium
moieties at both ends of the chain (runs 4−8, G4−G8) by 1H
NMR spectroscopy. Compound G6 (run 6), which consisted of a
C4 alkyl chain with pyridinium moieties at either end of the
chain, formed the most stable host−guest complex with 12[5] of
all of the compounds tested because the length of the C4 alkyl
chain provided the best fit to the height of the pillar[5]arene
cavity. Typical imidazolium ionic liquids are also good guests for
12[5] because of the electron-accepting nature of imidazolium
cations.152 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazoliums with Br− G9 and BF4−
G10 anions both formed 1:2 host−guest complexes with 12[5]
through a series of CT interactions (runs 9 and 10).
The per-hydroxylated pillar[6]arene 8[6] may also form
host−guest complexes with electron-acceptor systems. Huang et
al. reported that 8[6] formed host−guest complexes with
viologen and pyridinium derivatives.73 However, the binding
ability of 8[6] toward these electron-accepting guests was weaker
than that of the per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5] because
the cavity size of the former was too large to from stable host−
guest complexes with these guest molecules. The association
constant for the 8[6]⊃viologen salt G11 complex (run 11) was
determined to be (2.2 ± 0.3) × 102 M−1 based on the results of
1H NMR titration in acetone-d6. Notably, this result was almost
100 times lower than that of the 12[5]⊃viologen salt G1
complex (run 1), which was determined by fluorescence
measurements. An X-ray crystal structure of the 8[6]⊃G11
complex is shown in Figure 21b. The viologen moiety of G11 was
found to be in the cavity of 8[6]. Furthermore, the complex was
stabilized by hydrogen bonding and edge-to-face π-stacking
interactions between the host and the guest.



Per-alkylated pillar[n]arenes may also form host−guest
complexes through CT interactions because the constituent
1,4-dialkoxybenzene units also exhibit electron-donating properties (Figure 22 and Table 3).
The addition of the electron-acceptor tetracyanoethylene
(G12, TCNE) to per-ethylated pillar[5]arene 2[5] in chloroform changed the solution from colorless to dark green,
indicating the occurrence of a CT complexation process between
G12 and 2[5].102 The association constant (K) of the 1:1
2[5]⊃G12 complex was determined by UV−vis measurements
to be 62 ± 10 M−1 (run 12). Li et al. reported the formation of a
CT complex between the tropylium cation G13 and the perethylated pillar[6]arene 1[6].153 A 1:1 mixture of G13 and 1[6]
afforded a CT band (run 14), whereas no CT band was observed
for 1:1 mixtures of G13 with per-ethylated pillar[5]arene 2[5]
(run 13) or pillar[7]arene 1[7] (run 15). The lack of a CT band
in the latter of these two cases was attributed to G13 being too
big and small to fit inside the cavities of pillar[5]- and
pillar[7]arenes, respectively.
Per-functionalized pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes also form
host−guest complexes through CT interactions. Huang and coworkers reported the formation of a host−guest complex using a
pillar[5]arene bearing 10 ethylene oxide substituents 50[5].149
Mixing viologen salt G11 with 50[5] (run 16) resulted in a
change in the color of the solution from colorless to yellow, indicating the occurrence of a CT complexation process between
G11 and 50[5]. The association constant (K) of the complex was
determined by isothermal calorimetry (ITC) experiments to be
(3.35 ± 0.22) × 104 M−1, which was much larger than that of the
complex formed between G11 and the per-hydroxylated
pillar[6]arene 8[6] (run 11).73 The X-ray crystal structure of
this host−guest complex revealed that G11 was positioned inside
the cavity of 50[5] (Figure 22b). The complex was stabilized by
multiple interactions, including CH/O, CH/π interactions, and
face-to-face π-stacking interactions between the host and guest.
For the host−guest complex between G11 and the perhydroxylated pillar[6]arene 8[6], the viologen salt G11 was
stabilized by edge-to-face π-stacking interactions (Figure 21b).
These results therefore indicated that the viologen salt G11 was a
much better fit for the cavity of pillar[5]arene 50[5] than it was
for the cavity of pillar[6]arene 8[6]. The vinylogous viologen salt
G14 (run 17) and the bis-pyridinium guest G15 bearing a rigid π-
conjugated structure (run 18) also formed stable CT host−guest
complexes with 50[5] with associated constants (K) in the range
of 103−104 M−1.154,155 Huang and co-workers also reported the
formation of CT host−guest complex between diquit G16 and
pillar[6]arene 14[6] bearing 12 ethylene oxide chains (run 19).96
The mixing of G16 with pillar[6]arene 14[6] led to a dramatic
change in the color of the solution, whereas the mixing of G16
and pillar[5]arene 50[5] did not induce a color change. These
results therefore indicate that pillar[6]arene 14[6] formed a
stable host−guest complex with G16, whereas pillar[5]arene
50[5] did not.


5.2. Complexation by Cation/π Interactions
Cation/π interactions are defined as physical interactions
between an electron-rich π-electron system and a cation.
Pillar[n]arenes are composed of 1,4-dialkoxybenzene units and
can therefore form cation/π interactions with suitable cationic
molecules to give the corresponding host−guest complexes.
Huang and co-workers first investigated the formation of cation/
π interactions between per-alkylated pillar[5]arene and
ammonium cations as guest molecules (Figure 23 and Table 4).
The quaternary ammonium salt, octatrimethylammonium
hexafluorophosphate G17, has been included in per-alkylated
pillar[5]arenes.81 The results revealed that the nature of the
substituents on the rim of the pillar[5]arene had a pronounced
impact on the host−guest ability. Pillar[5]arene 4[5] bearing 10
butyl substituents formed a stable host−guest complex with G17
[run 20, K = (4.1 ± 0.4) × 103 M−1], which was larger than those
of the complexes formed between pillar[5]arenes 8[5] and 11[5]
bearing 10 (S)-methylbutyl55 (run 21) and 10 cyclohexylmethyl
groups (run 22),91 respectively. The introduction of steric
hindrance around the rim of the pillar[5]arene would lead to a
decrease in the stability of the host−guest complex by
attenuating the cationic/π interactions. The per-isobutylated
pillar[6]arene 3[6] formed a host−guest complex with noctatriethylammonium hexafluorophosphate G18 (run 24),
whereas the per-isobutylated pillar[5]arene 9[5] did not (run
23).135 The triethylammonium moiety, which is much bulkier
than the trimethylammonium moiety, was a much better fit for
the cavity of the pillar[6]arene host. However, this group was too
big to fit into the cavity of the pillar[5]arene host. Cations
containing bulky hydrocarbon groups such as adamantyl G20
(run 26) and DABCO cations G19 (run 25) are good guest
molecules for per-alkylated pillar[6]arenes.78,156 Pillar[5]- and
pillar[6]arenes also form host−guest complexes with secondary
ammonium cations. Huang and co-workers reported the
complexation of per-methylated pillar[5]arene 1[5] with noctylethylammonium G21 bearing a hexafluorophosphate anion
(run 27).157 Figure 23b shows the X-ray crystal structure of the
resulting complex, which revealed that the secondary ammonium
moiety of the guest was located in a cavity composed of five 1,4-
dimethoxybenzene units. Three NH/π interactions were
observed between the host and guest. The nature of the
counteranion had a pronounced impact on the complexation
ability of the ammonium cation. For example, changing the anion
from PF6− to Cl− resulted in very little complexation. The Cl−
anion is smaller than the PF6− anion and can therefore form a
stronger ion pair with the n-octylethylammonium cation in
chloroform, which would lead to a decrease in the ability of this
cation to form cation/π interactions. In contrast, the PF6− anion
forms a much looser ion pair with the n-octylethylammonium
cation in chloroform, which makes it much easier for the cation
to form cation/π interactions. Secondary ammonium cations
bearing weakly coordinating counter-anions can therefore form
highly stable host−guest complexes with per-ethylated pillar[5]-
and pillar[6]arenes because weakly coordinating anions
effectively afford free “naked” secondary ammonium cations. Li
et al. reported that pillar[5]arene formed a very stable host−
guest complex with the secondary ammonium cation G23 containing a linear butyl chain with a tetrakis[3,5-bis-
(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] borate (BArF−) anion (run 29, K >
104 M−1).156 Notably, this result was almost 5000 times larger
than that of the complex formed with the corresponding PF6−
salt G22 (run 28). The association constant (K) for the
complexation of pillar[6]arene 1[6] with the secondary
ammonium cation G20 containing a bulky adamantyl moiety
with a BArF− anion was also high (run 26, K = 3.4 × 103 M−1),
whereas very little complex was formed with the corresponding
PF6− salt.


5.3. Complexation by Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic
Interactions
Hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions mean the aggregation of
nonpolar molecules in polar solvents such as water. The cavity of
pillar[n]arenes is hydrophobic because it is composed of
hydrophobic benzene moieties. The introduction of hydrophilic
substituents such as cationic, anionic, or nonionic moieties to the
rims of the pillar[n]arenes makes them much more soluble in
water. Hydrophobic guests in aqueous media therefore are
encapsulated in the hydrophobic cavity of pillar[n]arenes to
escape the hydrophilic environment. The first water-soluble
pillar[5]arene to be reported in the literature was synthesized by
our group as pillar[5]arene 46[5] bearing 10 carboxylate
moieties (Figure 24 and Table 5).88
Pillar[n]arenes 46[5] captured paraquat G24 with a high
association constant [run 30, K = (8.2 ± 1.7) × 104 M−1], which
was determined by fluorescence measurements. It is noteworthy
that this association constant was almost 70 times higher than
that of the complex formed between paraquat and perhydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5] in methanol (Table 2, run
1).33 Cooperative physical bond interactions, including hydrophobic/hydrophilic, π−π, and multiple electrostatic interactions
between the anionic carboxylate moieties on the pillar[5]arene
rims and the cationic paraquat guest, contributed to the high
binding affinity of this host−guest complex. Li and co-workers
investigated the nature of these host−guest interactions using the
water-soluble pillar[5]arene 46[5].158 The results revealed that
the 1,4-bis(pyridinium)butane derivatives G25−G28 were good
guests for the water-soluble pillar[5]arene 46[5] (runs 31−34, K
> 104 M−1) because the length of the hydrophobic C4 linker was
a good fit to the pillar[5]arene cavity, and the pyridinium cation
of the guest formed multiple electrostatic interactions with the
carboxylate anions on both rims of the host. Water-soluble
pillar[5]arene 46[5] selectively encapsulated arginine (G29),
lysine (G30), and histidine (G31) from a mixture of 20 basic
amino acids (runs 35−37).159 It is noteworthy that all three of
these amino acids had two or more basic N-containing groups,
whereas all of the other amino acids contain only one such group.
This result therefore demonstrates that the formation of multiple
electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate anions of the
host and the basic cations of these amino acids made a
considerable contribution to their selective and strong binding as
compared to the other amino acids.
Huang and co-workers synthesized the water-soluble pillar[6]-
arene 13[6] by the introduction of 12 carboxylate anions and subsequently investigated its host−guest ability.160 The results
revealed that 13[6] formed highly stable host−guest complexes
with paraquat [run 38, G24, K = (1.02 ± 0.10) × 108 M−1]161 and
the pyridinium salts G32 and G33 (runs 39 and 40, K > 105
M−1).160,162−164 Pillar[6]arene 13[6] showed a higher guest
binding ability in aqueous media as compared to water-soluble
pillar[5]arene 46[5].88
Huang and co-workers also reported the preparation of watersoluble cationic pillar[5]arene 65[5] bearing 10 trimethylammonium bromide moieties (Figure 25).104
Pillar[5]arene 65[5] possesses cationic substituents and can
therefore form strong host−guest complexes with anionic
molecules bearing hydrophilic moieties. The anionic guest
molecule sodium 1-octanesulfonate (G34) was strongly
encapsulated in the hydrophobic cavity of 65[5] [run 41, K =
(1.33 ± 0.94) × 104 M−1] because the resulting complex was
stabilized by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.
Pillar[5]arene 65[5] also encapsulated several neutral molecules
(runs 42−44, G35−G37) and monosubstituted benzene
systems (runs 45−47, G38−G40), but their association
constants were determined to be in the range of 20−500 M−1,
and therefore lower than that of the complex formed between
G34 and 65[5] (run 41).165 The main driving force for the
formation of the host−guest complexes between the neutral and
monosubstituted benzene guests and 65[5] was hydrophobic/
hydrophilic interactions with no electrostatic interactions. These
results therefore indicate that the formation of electrostatic
interactions is important to stabilize the complexation. Li and coworkers synthesized pillar[6]arene 18[6] bearing 12 pyridinium
cations.101 In this case, anionic naphthalene derivatives bearing
sulfonate groups (runs 48 and 49, G41 and G42) were
determined to be good guests. Hou and co-workers reported
the water-soluble neutral pillar[5]arene 49[5] bearing 10 amino
moieties (Figure 26).89
Pillar[5]arene 49[5] also formed stable host−guest complexes
with long-chain linear diacids (n ≥ 10), but not with shorter
diacids (n = 8 and 9). This trend indicated that the hydrophobic
interaction of the chain with the host was playing an important
role in the complexation process in addition to the electrostatic
interaction between the carboxylic acid moieties of the guest and
the amino moieties on the pillar[5]arene rims.


5.4. Complexation by Cationic/Anionic Interactions
Pillar[n]arenes bearing ionic moieties on all of their substituents
are water-soluble, and their complexation with a variety of
different guest molecules has consequently been investigated in
aqueous media. When oppositely charged ionic molecules were
evaluated as guest molecules for host systems of this type,
cationic/anionic electrostatic interactions made a significant
contribution to the stabilization of the resulting complexes.
However, the complexation abilities of these systems through
electrostatic interactions were more pronounced in nonpolar
solvents than they were in polar solvents because the dissociation
of the ionic interaction was suppressed considerably in nonpolar
solvents. Yu et al. reported the formation of complexes between
alkyldiamines and pillar[5]arene 57[5] bearing dicarboxylic acid
moieties at its A1/A2 positions (Figure 27 and Table 6).98
These complexes were quite stable (runs 50−55, K = 105 M−1)
in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of chloroform and methanol. Figure 27b
shows the X-ray crystal structure of the 57[5]⊃pentyldiamine
G43 complex. This result showed that the ammonium groups at
both ends of the guest pointed toward the carboxylate anion to
form electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the pentyl chain of the guest was located inside the cavity, where it formed multiple
CH/π interactions to stabilize the complexation process. Diacid
57[5] also formed stable host−guest complexes with benzene
moieties bearing para-substituted amino groups such as pxylylenediamine (run 56, G49) and p-phenylenediamine (run 57,
G50).166 Xue et al. reported the formation of a stable host−guest
complex between pillar[5]arene 115[5] bearing one carboxylic
acid group and linear alkane G51 bearing a single amino group at
one end of its chain.167 The association constant of this complex
was determined to be (1.52 ± 0.075) × 104 M−1 (run 58), which
was higher than that of the complexes formed between peralkylated pillar[5]arenes and linear alkylamines. The electrostatic
interactions formed between the carboxylate anion and
ammonium cation of the host and guest molecules, respectively,
in organic solvents made a considerable contribution to the
stabilization of this complex.


5.5. Complexation by Hydrogen-Bond Interactions
In 2011, IUPAC defined hydrogen-bond interactions as follows:
the hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between a
hydrogen atom from a molecule or a molecular fragment X−H in
which X is more electronegative than H, and an atom or a group
of atoms in the same or a different molecule, in which there is
evidence of bond formation.168 In the broadest possible sense,
CH/π interactions may be defined as the weakest possible
hydrogen bond. Huang and co-workers reported the existence of
CH/π hydrogen-bonding interactions between n-hexane and
per-butylated pillar[5]arene 4[5] by X-ray crystallography
(Figure 28a).81 The important pillar[5]arene/alkyl chain
recognition motif first established by them has been widely
used in pillar[n]arene supramolecular chemistry.
The inclusion of an n-hexane molecule in the cavity of 4[5] has
also been observed. Four of the hydrogen atoms of the n-hexane
molecule were less than 3.05 Å away from the π-plane of the
pillar[5]arene, therefore indicating the existence CH/π interactions. We found that pillar[5]arenes showed good alkaneshape selectivity (Figure 28b).119 Pillar[5]arenes formed host−
guest complexes with linear hydrocarbons, but did not form
complexes with branched- or cyclic-shaped hydrocarbons. Li et
al. investigated the complexation of linear hydrocarbons with
pillar[5]arenes.169 The complexation ability of pillar[5]arene
with linear alkane such as n-octane (G54) was very weak (run 61,
K < 2 M−1), and much lower than those of 1,7-octadiyne (run 59,
G52) and 1,7-octadiene (run 60, G53) (Figure 29 and Table 7).
Stoddart and co-workers investigated the neutral guest
recognition ability of pillar[5]arene using 1,8-diaminooctane
(G46) and n-octylamine (G55) as guests.82 The association
constant between G46 and the per-methylated pillar[5]arene
1[5] was determined to be 70 ± 10 M−1 (run 62) by 1H NMR
spectroscopy, which was 3 times higher than the association
constant between n-octylamine (G55) and per-methylated
pillar[5]arene 1[5] (run 63, K = 20 ± 2 M−1). These results
therefore indicated that the terminal groups of the linear alkanes
were contributing to the stabilization of the complexation
process. Li and co-workers reported that simple per-alkylated
pillar[5]arenes can form stable host−guest complexes with the
neutral 1-substituted 1,3-imidazole guest G57.170 A butyl linker
bearing two imidazole groups formed the most stable host−guest
complex with pillar[5]arene [run 65, K = (2.0 ± 0.4) × 104 M−1]
of all of the alkane linkers tested bearing 1,3-imidazoles groups at
either end of the chain. The complexation of 1,4-butylene guests
substituted with nitrogen heterocycles with pillar[5]arenes was
also investigated by Li and co-workers.171 Nitrogen heterocycles
containing outer N atoms such as 1-substituted 1,2,3-triazole
G58 and 1,2,4-triazole G60 were good guests for pillar[5]arenes
(runs 66 and 68), whereas heterocycles without an outer N atom
such as 1,2-imidazole G56 and 1,2,5-triazole G59 were not (runs
64 and 67). Figure 30a shows the X-ray crystal structure of the
per-ethylated pillar[5]arene 2[5]⊃G57 complex.



In addition to CH/π and CH/O hydrogen-bonding
interactions, several CH/N hydrogen bonds were observed between the ethyl substituents on the rims of the pillar[5]arene
and the outer N-3 atom of the guest. The CH/N hydrogen
bonds, in particular, played an important role in the stabilization
of the complex. Li and co-workers also reported the formation of
highly effective binding interactions between neutral dinitriles
and simple per-alkylated pillar[5]arenes.172 The association
ability in these cases was found to be largely dependent on the
length of the alkyl chain between the two nitrile groups. Dinitrile
G62 with a C4 linker was the best fit of all of the dinitriles tested
for the cavity of per-ethylated pillar[5]arene [run 70, K = (1.5 ±
0.3) × 104 M−1] in terms of its length. Figure 30b shows the
crystal structure of the per-ethylated pillar[5]arene⊃1,4-
dicyanobutane G62 complex. This structure revealed that 1,4-
dicyanobutane was located inside of the pillar[5]arene cavity, and
the guest formed multiple CH/π interactions with the host, as
well as several CH/O and CH/N interactions. These multiple
weak hydrogen-bonding interactions made a considerable
contribution to the stabilization of the complex. Butylene linkers
bearing two electron-withdrawing groups are good guests for
pillar[5]arenes. With this in mind, Li et al. investigated the
complexation of per-alkylated pillar[5]arenes with 1,4-dihalobutanes.146 The results revealed that the association constants
increased in the order of F < Cl < Br < I (runs 72−75), indicating
that the main driving force for the complexation of these guests
was the dispersion force, which is dependent on the movement of
electrons to produce temporary dipoles. Figure 30c shows the
crystal structure of the per-ethylated pillar[5]arene 2[5]⊃1,4-
dichlorobutane G65 complex. The structure revealed the
presence of several CH/π and CH/O hydrogen bonds, as well
as a series of CH/Cl hydrogen bonds, which resulted in the
stabilization of the complex.
Li et al. reported the regioselective host−guest complexation
of the nonsymmetric pillar[5]arene 116[5] bearing methyl and
pentyl substituents on its rims with the nonsymmetric butylene
guest G68 bearing cyano and bromide groups at either end of its
chain (Figure 31).173
The association constant of the complex formed between the
nonsymmetric guest G68 and the nonsymmetric pillar[5]arene
116[5] was (8.4 ± 0.6) × 104 M−1 (run 78), which is around 5
times higher than those obtained for the symmetric pillar[5]-
arenes 1[5] and 5[5] bearing methyl and n-pentyl substituents
on their rims (runs 76 and 77), respectively. Taken together,
these results indicated that the binding to the pillar[5]arenes
occurring in a regioselective manner. Figure 31a shows the X-ray
crystal structure of the complex formed between the nonsymmetric guest G68 and the nonsymmetric pillar[5]arene
116[5]. The structure showed that the CN side of the guest was
positioned in close proximity to the methyl rim of the
pillar[5]arene, while the pentyl rim exhibited a preference for
the Br side. Five CH/O, seven CH/π, and several CH/N
hydrogen-bonding interactions accounted for the observed
regioselectivity (Figure 31b).


5.6. Pillar[n]arene-Based Stimuli-Responsive Host−Guest
Complexation/Decomplexation Systems
Stimuli-responsive host−guest complexation systems are very
useful because they can be used as switches to control
supramolecular assemblies. The stimuli-induced switching of
the electronic distribution properties of guests is a useful strategy
for inducing complexation/decomplexation processes, because
electrostatic effects are very important factors for determining
the strength of host−guest interactions. Li et al. reported the
development of a stimuli-responsive host−guest system using
acid−base stimulus (Figure 32a).174
Alternating the addition of acid and base allowed for the
switching of the complexation/decomplexation of the host−
guest complex formed between pillar[5]arene 12[5] and 1,4-
bis(imidazolium)butane G69. Pillar[5]arene formed a host−
guest complex with the protonated state of the 1,4-bis-
(imidazolium) dication, because of the formation of an activecation/π interaction between the 1,4-bis(imidazolium)dication
and pillar[5]arene. The addition of a suitable base led to the
deprotonation of the guest, which subsequently triggered the
dethreading of the guest from the pillar[5]arene cavity. Li et al.
also reported the development of a pH-responsive molecular
switch based on the same concept using pillar[6]arene as a host
and a bis(1,2,3-triazolium)butane cation as the guest.175 Silver(I)
ions can form a complex with imidazolinium cations, and the
addition of Ag+ to host−guest complexes based on imidazolinium cations can also lead to the dissociation of these
complex.176
We reported that the time scale for the photoresponsive
transformations involved in the complexation/decomplexation
of host−guest complexes extended from seconds to hours
(Figure 32b).177 We synthesized the axle-type system G70
bearing a bulky adamantyl stopper at one end of the axle and a
photoresponsive azobenzene group at the other. The exchange
rate between the complexation/decomplexation of the complex
formed between trans-G70 and 12[5] was quite fast with a halflife of 3.33 ± 0.21 s. In contrast, the exchange rate of the complex
formed between cis-G70 and 12[5] was much slower with a halflife of 9.13 ± 1.2 h, which allowed the process to be readily
monitored. The photoinduced isomerization of G70 from its
trans form to its cis form led to an increase in the free energy of
activation, which in turn led to the observed photoresponsive
time-scale transformation.
The photoresponsive host−guest complexation of an
azobenzene guest with a pillar[6]arene host was investigated
by Huang and co-workers (Figure 33a).136
The simple per-propylated pillar[6]arene 2[6] strongly
encapsulated the trans-form of the azobenzene guest G71 [K =
(2.22 ± 0.34) × 103 M−1]. In contrast, the binding affinity of 2[6]
to the corresponding cis-form of the azobenzene guest was much
less pronounced [K = (2.64 ± 0.29) × 102 M−1]. This difference
in the association constants of these complexes could be used as a
photoinduced switching mechanism for supramolecular assemblies constructed from these host−guest complexes. Photoresponsive complexation systems in organic media using
azobenzene guests and pillar[6]arene hosts have been expanded
to aqueous media.97
Lin and co-workers constructed a photoresponsive host−guest
system using photoresponsive carbamate derivatives (Figure
33b).178 The association constant for the complex formed
between the axle-type compound G72 bearing a photoresponsive ortho-nitrobenzene group at one end and an
unsubstituted benzyl group at the other and the per-ethylated
pillar[5]arene 2[5] was determined to be (8.56 ± 0.05) × 102
M−1. The photoirradiation of this system led to the precipitation
of a photocleavage product, which appeared as a consequence of
the poor solubility of the photocleavage product in the medium.
Wang and co-workers reported the development of a redoxresponsive host−guest complexation system (Figure 33c).179 In
this case, the simple per-butylated pillar[6]arene 4[6] formed a
strong host−guest complex with the oxidized form of the
ferrocenium cation G73, while the reduced form of the ferrocene
formed much weaker host−guest complexes with pillar[6]arene
4[6]. The redox reaction of ferrocene is completely reversible;
thus the redox-responsive complexation can be used as a
switching mechanism for the complexation/decomplexation of
these systems.


5.7. Application of Pillar[n]arene-Based Host−Guest
Systems
Pillar[5]arenes form host−guest complexes with linear hydrocarbons but not with branched or cyclic hydrocarbons. On the
basis of the alkane-shape selectivity of these systems, we reported
the shape-selective oxidation of alkenes using pillar[5]arene as a
catalyst (Figure 34a).105
The amphiphilic pillar[5]arene 66[5] bearing 10 tetra-alkyl
phosphonium cations was found to be soluble in aqueous and
organic media depending on the nature of the counteranions.
Counter anion exchange from Br− to MnO4− led to the phasetransfer of the pillar[5]arene from the aqueous to the chloroform
phase. In the organic phase, the MnO4− anions can react with the
alkene molecules. At this stage, 1-hexene was fixed in close enough proximity to the MnO4− anions to allow for its efficient
oxidation because of the host−guest complexation between
pillar[5]arene and 1-hexene. The oxidation reaction of 1-hexene
proceeded completely (conversion >99%). In contrast, the
oxidation of the branched alkene 4-methyl-1-hexene was low
conversion (conversion 31%) because of the inability of the
branched structure to form complexes with pillar[5]arene.
Cohen and co-workers investigated application of watersoluble pillar[5]arene 46[5] for 129X NMR biosensors (Figure
34b).180 Xenon is hydrophobic, and thus has low solubility in
water. However, encapsulation of xenon into the cavity of watersoluble pillar[5]arene contributed to solubilization of xenon in
aqueous media. The NMR chemical shift of xenon is highly
sensitive to the microenvironment. A downfield shift of peak
from xenon was observed by addition of hydrophobic n-hexane,
indicating inclusion of n-hexane into the pillar[5]arene cavity
changed the microenvironment around xenon in the cavity of
pillar[5]arene.
Yu et al. reported the complexation of acetylcholine G74 with
the water-soluble pillar[5]arene 46[5] under aqueous conditions. The association constant for this complex was high [K =
(1.97 ± 0.55) × 104 M−1] (Figure 35).181
The hydrolysis of G74 is facilitated by acetylcholinesterase.
The mixing of G74 (30 mM) with acetylcholinesterase (1 U/
mL) in aqueous media led to the complete hydrolysis of G74 in 1
h (Figure 35a, red line). In contrast, the hydrolysis of G74
proceeded at a much slower rate in the presence of the watersoluble pillar[5]arene 46[5] (30 mM), with only 70% hydrolysis
after 1 h (Figure 35b, black line). These results indicated that the
hydrolysis of G74 was being inhibited by the complexation of
G74 with the 46[5].
Yuan and co-workers investigated the extraction of metal ions
using pillar[5]arene 117[5] bearing 10 phosphine oxide
chelating groups. The results revealed that pillar[5]arene
117[5] selectively recognized f-block elements (Figure
36a).182,183
The selectivity of this system for f-block elements was
extremely high as compared to the unit model and the classic
extractant tri-n-octylphosphine oxide. Pillar[5]arene 117[5]
showed high selectivity for thorium(IV) and uranyl(VI) cations.
In contrast, per-methylated pillar[5]arene 1[5] bearing no
chelating groups did not show any extraction ability for these
cations. These results therefore demonstrated that the 10
phosphine oxide moieties on the pillar[5]arene rims were
contributing to the metal cation extraction process. Pillar[5]-
arene 117[5] also captured heavy-metal ions such as Co2+, Cu2+,
Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Ag2+, and Hg2+. Pillar[5]arenes with other
chelating agents bearing 10 diglycolamide moieties on its rims
118[5] showed excellent extraction efficiency toward
americium(III) and europium(III) cations (Figure 36b).184,185
A characteristic emission was detected when europium(III)
cation was extracted with 118[5] because the europium(III)−
diglycolamide complex shows a strong fluorescence sig


6. SUPRAMOLECULAR ASSEMBLY OF
PILLAR[n]ARENES
6.1. Supramolecular Assemblies from Pillar[n]arenes in
Solution
6.1.1. Self-Inclusion Complexes, Cyclic Dimers, and
Supramolecular Polymers Based on Host−Guest Complexation Processes. Supramolecular polymers are polymeric
arrays of monomeric units that are brought together by physical
interactions including host−guest interactions and that show
chain-like behaviors in solution and in bulk.186,187 Pillar[5]arenes
form host−guest complexes with cationic molecules and neutral
molecules bearing electron-withdrawing groups. Pillar[5]arenebased heteroditopic monomers and host−guest conjugates can
therefore form a variety of different supramolecular structures
such as self-inclusion complexes, cyclic dimers, and supramolecular polymers. We reported the synthesis of a host−guest
conjugate between pillar[5]arene and the trimethylammonium
guest moiety 54[5] (Figure 37a).65
Compound 54[5] formed a self-inclusion complex in CDCl3.
The driving force for this complexation process was the
formation of cationic/π interactions. These interactions were
weakened when the conjugate was treated with a polar solvent
such as acetone-d6, which led to the dethreading of the guest
molecule from the host. Hu and co-workers reported the
conversion of a host−guest conjugate to a mixture of three
isomers, including the uncomplexed material 119[5]a and the
two self-inclusion complexes 119[5]b and 119[5]c, under
equilibrium conditions.188 Following the addition of fluoride
ions, the self-inclusion complex 119[5]b was converted to the
other self-inclusion complex 119[5]c because of the formation of
a binding interaction between the amide group of 119[5] and the
fluoride ions (Figure 37b). Huang et al. and Meier and Cao et al.
also reported the formation of supramolecular dimers from
host−guest conjugates (Figure 38a).
Pillar[5]arenes 120[5]189 and 121[5]190 bearing hydroxyl and
bromide groups at the end of their alkyl guests formed double threaded supramolecular dimers (Figure 38a). Yang and coworkers reported the construction of highly emissive doublethreaded supramolecular dimers from pillar[5]arenes bearing
one ammonium group and the fluorescent dye 96[5] (Figure
38c).118 The formation of this supramolecular dimer restricted
the motion of the fluorescent dye with the dimerization,
therefore enhancing the fluorescence intensity. Changing the
pH or adding a different anion led to the dissociation of the
dimeric structure and fluorescence quenching. Huang and coworkers also synthesized pillar[5]arenes carrying the long-chain
alkyl guest 122[5] without a bromide group at the end of its
chain (Figure 38b).191 These host−guest conjugates formed
supramolecular polymers under high concentration conditions,
as well as in the solid state. The driving force for the formation of
supramolecular dimers and polymers are CH/π interactions. The
CH/π interactions involved in the formation of host−guest
complexes are weak, and high concentration conditions are
required to allow for the successful formation of supramolecular
polymers (ca. 500 mM). Strong host−guest interactions are
therefore required for the construction of high molecular weight
supramolecular polymers. Stoddart and co-workers synthesized a
monofunctionalized pillar[5]arene carrying the viologen moiety
88[5] (Figure 38b).116 The cation/π interactions responsible for
the formation of the complex between viologen and pillar[5]-
arene were much stronger than the CH/π interactions formed
between a linear alkyl chain and pillar[5]arene. Supramolecular
daisy chin polymers therefore were formed at intermediate
concentrations (ca. 20 mM), with higher concentrations (>25
mM) leading to the formation of an organogel. Pillar[5]arenes
carrying ammonium groups also allowed for the efficient
formation of supramolecular polymers under intermediate
concentrations.192−196
The installation of specific functional groups into host−guest
conjugates can be used as an effective strategy for controlling and
enhancing the formation of supramolecular polymers. Yang and
co-workers reported the incorporation of a photoresponsive stiff
stilbene between pillar[5]arene and the imidazole guest 123[5]
(Figure 39).197
The Z-123[5] isomer mainly formed a self-inclusion complex,
as well as a double-threaded dimer. The photoirradiation of Z-
123[5] resulted in its photoisomerization to E-123[5]. E-123[5]
formed a low molecular weight supramolecular polymer. The
addition of trifluoroacetic acid resulted in the protonation of the
imidazole moiety of E-123[5]a, which led to the formation of a
high molecular weight supramolecular polymer by enhancing the
host−guest complexation ability of the system.



Stoddart and co-workers reported the incorporation of a
porphyrin moiety between a pillar[5]arene host and a viologen
guest to give conjugate 124[5] (Figure 40a).198
The host−guest conjugate 124[5] formed a supramolecular
polymer (Figure 40a), with intermolecular stacking interactions
between the porphyrin units in the supramolecular polymers
making a significant contribution to the bundle formation of the
supramolecular polymers (Figure 40b). The entanglement of
these bundles led to the formation of an elastic organogel. We
reported the preparation of supramolecular polymers with alternating pillar[5]arene and pillar[6]arene units by the mixing
of the two heterotopic host−guest conjugates 55[5] and 16[6]
(Figure 40c).78 The mixing of monofunctionalized pillar[5]arene
carrying the pillar[6]arene guest DABCO cation 55[5] with
pillar[6]arene carrying the pillar[5]arene guest pyridinium cation
16[6] afforded supramolecular polymers with alternating
pillar[5]arene and pillar[6]arene units.
Two component mixtures of host−host and guest−guest
homoditopic conjugates also afford supramolecular polymers.
121,199 We reported that the mixing of the azobenzenebridged pillar[5]arene dimer 101[5] with the homoditopic bispyridinium guest G75 led to a supramolecular polymerization
process (Figure 41a).121
The mixing of trans-101[5] with guest dimer G75 led to the
formation of a supramolecular polymer. The subsequent
irradiation of this polymer with UV light induced the
photoisomerization of the azobenzene moiety to give cis-
101[5], which contributed to the subsequent disassembly of
the supramolecular polymer. These supramolecular assembly
and disassembly processes were found to be completely
reversible and could be readily controlled by alternating between
UV and visible light irradiation. Wang and co-workers
constructed a supramolecular polymer using the pillar[5]arene
dimer 72[5], which was formed through a quadruple-hydrogen
bonding interaction (Figure 41b).107 The addition of the
homoditopic diviologen guest G76 led to the formation of a
supramolecular polymer. Li and co-workers reported the
construction of a dimer based on a 2:1 sandwich-type CT
complex between pillar[5]arene and N,N′-bisalkylpyromellitic
diimide.200 A 2:1:1 (mol/mol/mol) mixture of pillar[5]arene
4[5], N,N′-bisalkylpyromellitic diimide 1, and the homoditopic
guest G77 afforded a supramolecular polymer (Figure 41c). The
incorporation of fluorescent moieties between the homoditopic
host−host and/or guest−guest conjugates allowed for the
construction of supramolecular polymers showing a variety of
different fluorescence colors.123,126,201 BODIPY dyes are tunable
fluorescence dyes with high adsorption coefficients and
fluorescence yields. Wang and co-workers reported the synthesis
of the BODIPY-bridged pillar[5]arene dimer 108[5] and two
BODIPY derivative bearing two different guest moieties (G78
and G79, Figure 42a).126
The supramolecular polymerization process resulting from the
mixing of the pillar[5]arene dimer 108[5] containing BODIPY
dye and the BODIPY guest dimers (G78 and G79) induced a
FRET process. This FRET process occurred as a consequence of
the BODIPY moiety in the host dimer being positioned quite
close to the BODIPY moiety in the guest dimer of the
supramolecular polymer. The introduction of photo-202 and γ-
ray
125-responsive moieties to form pillar[5]arene dimers allowed
for the formation of stimuli-responsive supramolecular polymers.
The dissociation of the stimuli-responsive linker between the
pillar[5]arene dimers resulted in the disassembly of the
supramolecular polymers. Jiang and Wang reported the synthesis
of the heteroditopic host, pillar[5]arene-fused cryptant 125[5]
(Figure 42b).203 The addition of two homoditopic guests (G80
and G81) promoted the connection of the heterohost dimer,
which led to the formation of a supramolecular polymer.
Li and co-workers reported the construction of supramolecular network polymers using the AB2-type heterotritopic
pillar[5]arene monomer 126[5].204 In this case, the AB2-type
monomer underwent a self-assembly process under high
concentration conditions to form a supramolecular network
polymer (Figure 43a).
The addition of a competitive guest to this system led to the
depolymerization of the supramolecular network polymer. The
other approach used for the formation of supramolecular
network polymers involved the mixing of homoditopic host
97[5] with homotritopic guest G82 (Figure 43b, A2/B3-type).205
The combination of a homoditopic host with a homotetratopic
guest (A2/B4-type),129 homotritopic host 127[5] with homoditopic guest G83 (Figure 43c, A3/B2-type),206 a homotetratopic
host with a homoditopic guest (A4/B2-type),122,127 or a
homohexatopic host with a homoditopic guest (A6/B2-type)207
resulted in the formation of supramolecular polymers with
network structures. Wang and co-workers reported a supramolecular polymer with vacant cavities resulting from the
pillar[5]arenes 73[5] through quadruple-hydrogen bonding
interactions (Figure 43d).208 The addition of guest dimer G84
to pillar[5]arene 73[5] resulted in the formation of a supramolecular network polymer with the guest dimer acting as
an intermolecular cross-linking agent between the supramolecular polymers.209


6.1.2. Supramolecular Assembly Using Organic Polymers with Pillar[n]arenes. The mixing of organic polymers
carrying pillar[n]arenes and guest moieties is another useful
method for the construction of supramolecular polymers with
network structures. Wang and co-workers reported the
formation of a redox-reversible supramolecular network using
organic polymers consisting of pillar[6]arene 2 and ferrocene
moiety 3 (Figure 44a).210
When the ferrocene in polymer 2 existed in its reduced form,
the polymer did not form a supramolecular network because the
host−guest interaction between ferrocene and pillar[6]arene was
weak. In contrast, the oxidation of ferrocene led to the formation
of a gel-like supramolecular network because of the strong host−
guest interaction between the oxidized ferrocenium ion and
pillar[6]arene.
Wang and co-workers reported the synthesis of the π-
conjugated polymer 4 based on a poly(phenylene ethynylene)
backbone bearing molecular recognition sites for pillar[5]arenes
on its side chains (Figure 44b).211,212 Fluorescence from the π-
conjugated polymer was quenched by the addition of the noctylpyrazinium cation G85 because of an electron transfer
process from the π-conjugated polymer 4 to the n-octylpyrazinium cation G85. The addition of halide anions led to
fluorescence recovery in the order of Cl− > Br− > I−. Chloride
anions are small and possess a high charge density as compared to
the other anions, allowing them to form a strong interaction with
the n-octylpyrazinium cation G85, thereby triggering the
decomplexation of the pillar[5]arenes in polymer 4 and G85.
Stoddart and co-workers synthesized one-dimensional tubular
arrays by the condensation reaction of pillar[5]arene with one of
the A−B units in pillar[5]arene 128[5] (Figure 44c).213 The
conversion of one-dimensional tubular arrays derived from
pillar[5]arene dimers to pillar[5]arene 9-mers could be obtained
under microwave heating conditions.



6.1.3. Formation of Micelles, Vesicles, and Tubes. On
the basis of the high functionality and host−guest properties of
pillar[n]arenes, it is possible to create amphiphilic pillar[n]arene
hosts and amphiphilic host−guest complexes consisting of
hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. These amphiphilic hosts
and complexes have the ability to form various supramolecular
assemblies in hydrophobic and hydrophilic solvents. Huang and
co-workers have studied the nanostructures prepared from
amphiphilic pillar[n]arenes extensively. They synthesized an
amphiphilic pillar[5]arene containing five amino groups on its
hydrophilic head and five alkyl chains on its hydrophobic tail
(Figure 45a).134,214
Pillar[5]arene 129[5] initially formed self-assembled bilayer
vesicles in aqueous media, which were subsequently transformed
into necklace- and sheet-like structures. These two structures
were then further fused into microtubes, which exhibited a strong
adsorption affinity for the famous explosive trinitrotoluene. Xue
and co-workers investigated the formation of vesicles and
microtubes from amphiphilic pillar[5]arenes bearing hydrophobic alkyl chains of different lengths.215 The formation of
bimolecular micelles from the amphiphilic pillar[5]arene 130[5]
bearing five hydrophilic amino groups and hydrophobic alkyl tails was reported by Sakurai and co-workers (Figure 45b).216
Pillar[5]arenes 131[5] and 132[5] bearing five hydrophilic
oligo(ethylene oxide) chains and five hydrophobic alkyl chains,
respectively,114,217 also formed vesicles. The same occurred in
copillar[5]arene 133[5] bearing one amphiphilic oligo(ethylene
oxide) chain unit,218 as well as several monofunctionalized
pillar[5]-117 and pillar[6]arenes.219 Pei and co-workers reported
the formation of redox-responsive cationic vesicles from the
amphiphilic pillar[5]arene 77[5] bearing five ferrocenium
cations (Figure 45c).110 The resulting cationic vesicles exhibited
redox-responsive behavior as a consequence of the redox
reaction between the ferrocenium cations and the neutral
ferrocenyl groups. This system allowed for the development of
an ideal glutathione (GSH)-responsive drug/siRNA codelivery
system for rapid drug release and gene transfection in cancer cells
because cancer cells typically have a higher GSH concentration
than normal cells. Another method that is often used for the
formation of various nanostructures is the construction of
amphiphilic molecules through host−guest complexation
processes (Figure 46).
Huang and co-workers reported the construction of vesicles
from the host−guest complexes formed between azobenzene
guest G71 and pillar[6]arene 2[6].136 Pillar[6]arene 2[6]
formed a complex with trans-G71, and the assembled structure
of this complex consisted of irregular aggregates in chloroform.
The irradiation of this complex with light led to the dethreading
of the azobenzene guest because it underwent a photoisomerization process from its trans-form to its cis-form. The
resulting mixture of pillar[6]arene 2[6] and cis-G71 underwent
an assembly process in chloroform to give vesicle-like aggregates.
Huang et al. have also reported similar photoswitching processes
for nanostructural changes between the solid nanoparticles and
vesicles formed in aqueous media from a water-soluble
pillar[6]arene and an amphiphilic azobenzene guest.220
The pH-,161,162,221−224 chemical-,225−232 CO2-,233,234 and
photoresponsive235,236 supramolecular vesicles consisting of
water-soluble pillar[n]arene and stimuli-responsive amphiphilic
molecules have also reported. Furthermore, considerable
research has been directed toward the application of these
stimuli-responsive supramolecular vesicles to the development of
controlled drug release134,161,162,217,221−223,225−227,229,236,237 and
bioimaging114 systems.



6.1.4. Lower Critical Solution Temperature Materials.
Our group reported amphiphilic pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes
with tri(ethylene oxide) groups (51[5] and 15[6], Figure 47a),
which showed lower critical solution temperatures (LCSTs) in
aqueous media.90,97
These pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes were soluble in aqueous
media at 25 °C. Interestingly, these solutions became turbid
when they were heated at 50 °C, but then became clear again
when they were cooled to 25 °C (Figure 47a). The LCST
behavior of these amphiphilic pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes was
attributed to the combination of hydrophilic triethylene oxide
chains with a hydrophobic pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arene backbone. The cloud point of the amphiphilic pillar[5]arene 51[5] in
2 mM aqueous solution was 41 °C, which was similar to that of
the corresponding amphiphilic pillar[6]arene 15[6] (42 °C).
Pillar[5]arenes form CT host−guest complexes with viologen
derivatives, which led to the addition of didecylviologen
dibromide G86. The cloud point of the amphiphilic pillar[5]-
arene 51[5] increased from 42 to 60 °C following the addition of
G86 (Figure 47b). This increase was attributed to the existence
of repulsive forces between the complexed cations following the
addition of G86, which inhibited the aggregation of the
complexes. Viologen derivatives form very stable host−guest
complexes with CB[7], which led us to investigate the addition of
CB[7] to an aqueous solution of the CT host−guest complex. As
the concentration of CB[7] increased, the cloud point of the
mixture decreased from 60 to 47 °C. This decrease in the cloud
point was attributed to the decomplexation of G86 from 51[5]
upon addition of the competitive host CB[7]. Overall, it was
possible to tune the cloud point of the amphiphilic pillar[5]arene
using the viologen guest G86 and the competitive host CB[7].
Pillar[6]arenes form host−guest complexes with trans-state
azobenzene derivatives, but not with the corresponding cis-state
compounds. Using a photoresponsive host−guest system, we
demonstrated the photoreversible switching of LCST (Figure 47c).97 The trans-state azobenzene guest G87 bearing two
DABCO cations formed a host−guest complex with the
amphiphilic pillar[6]arene 15[6]. This complexation process
led to an increase in the cloud point of the amphiphilic
pillar[6]arene from 41 to 57 °C. However, the cloud point of the
mixture decreased from 57 to 52 °C upon UV irradiation, which
led to a change in the conformation of the azobenzene guest from
its trans-state to its cis-state. This photoisomerization process led
to the dissociation of the complex because the cavity size of the
pillar[6]arene did not fit the cis-form of the azobenzene guest.
Notably, the cloud point of the mixture returned to 57 °C by
visible light irradiation, which led to the conversion of the cisform of the guest back to the trans-form, which could be
rethreaded through the host cavity. This photoinduced
threading/dethreading sequence contributed to the photoswitching for the LCST behavior of the amphiphilic pillar[6]-
arene.



We also reported dual-responsive, redox-, and host−guest
complexation-responsive LCST changes following the introduction of one benzoquinone unit to the amphiphilic pillar[5]arene
(quinone-H134[5], Figure 48).72
The cloud point of quinone-134[5] in 2 mM aqueous solution
was observed at 21 °C, which was lower than that of the
amphiphilic pillar[5]arene without the benzoquinone unit (41
°C in 51[5]). This difference in the cloud points was attributed
to the benzoquinone unit being more hydrophobic than the
tri(ethylene oxide)-modified unit. The addition of a reducing
agent resulted in the formation of the amphiphilic pillar[5]arene
bearing one hydroquinone unit (2OH-134[5]). The cloud point
of this mixture was determined to be 31 °C, which was higher
than that of the cloud point of quinone-134[5] (21 °C). This
difference was attributed to the hydroquinone moiety being
more hydrophilic than benzoquinone. The subsequent addition
of an oxidizing agent led to a decrease in the cloud point from 31
to 21 °C because the hydroquinone was oxidized to a
benzoquinone. The redox-switching of the cloud point was a
reversible process that could be controlled by alternating the
addition of reducing and oxidizing agents. Quinone-134[5] and
2OH-134[5] also showed guest-responsive LCST changes, in
that the addition of a cationic viologen guest G86 to an aqueous
solution of quinone-134[5] or 2OH-134[5] led to an increase in
the cloud point.
Larger pillar[n]arene homologues with tri(ethylene oxide)
chains also showed LCST behavior. When 2 mM aqueous
solutions of pillar[7]- and pillar[10]arenes bearing tri(ethylene
oxide) chains (Scheme 18, 4[7] and 4[10]) were heated at 50
°C, they became turbid.95,238 Huang and co-workers reported
that pillar[7]arene 4[7] formed a stable host−guest complex
with the trans-form of the azobenzene guest [(1.97 ± 0.24) × 104
M−1], which was more stable than the complex formed with the
cis-form of the azobenzene guest [(1.87 ± 0.13) × 103 M−1]. This
system could therefore be used as photoswitchable supramolecular assembly system. Xue and co-workers reported that
pillar[10]arene 4[10] accommodated a bulky diazapyrenium salt
[(4.2 ± 0.3) × 104 M−1]. The complexation of this guest led to an increase in the cloud point from 40 to 58 °C. Notably, the
complex dissociated following the addition of diethylamine, and
subsequently reformed following the addition of trifluoroacetic
acid. It was therefore possible to switch the cloud point of the
pillar[10]arenes by alternating the addition of diethylamine and
trifluoroacetic acid.
LCST is generally observed in aqueous media. Huang and coworkers reported the unique LCST behavior of the host−guest
complex formed between pillar[5]arene and the ionic liquid 1,3-
dimethylimidazolium iodide in chloroform (Figure 49).239
The solubility of 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (G88) in
chloroform is low (0.38 wt %, 25.6 mM), which resulted in the
formation of a biphasic mixture at 25 °C (Figure 49a).
Pillar[5]arene 3[5] formed a relatively stable host−guest
complex with G88 in chloroform [1.04 (±0.15) × 103 M−1],
which was highly soluble in chloroform. Therefore, the addition
of pillar[5]arene 3[5] resulted in the conversion of a biphasic
mixture to a homogeneous solution (Figure 49b). The
complexation of G88 into the cavity of 3[5] contributed to the
formation of the homogeneous solution. The solution became
turbid with heating (Figure 49c), and subsequently became clear
when the mixture was cooled. The dethreading of G88 from the
cavity of 3[5] at elevated temperatures led to the observed
separation of the phases because of the reduced stability of the
complex at high temperatures.


6.2. Bulk Supramolecular Assemblies Constructed from
Pillar[n]arenes
The rich functionality37,38 and highly regular symmetrical pillarshaped structures of pillar[n]arenes mean that they can form
highly functional and well-ordered pillar[n]arene-based bulk
supramolecular assemblies. In this section, we will discuss the
formation and properties of bulk-state pillar[n]arene assemblies
in the liquid, ionic liquid, and crystalline states.
6.2.1. Liquid Pillar[n]arenes. Macrocyclic compounds
generally exist in the solid state at 25 °C. The formation of
host−guest complexes involving macrocyclic compounds therefore requires a solvent. We discovered that the ionic liquidmodified pillar[5]arene 68[5] could exist in the liquid state at 25
°C based on the choice of an appropriate counteranion (Figure
50a).102
In the case of the hexafluorophosphate anion (PF6−), the
compound existed in the solid state, and exhibited a melting
temperature of 108 °C. In contrast, the use of a bis-
(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (TFSA) anion resulted in a
compound that existed in the liquid state at 25 °C with a freezing
temperature of −7 °C. The ionic liquid pillar[5]arene 68[5]
bearing TFSA anions showed ionic conductivity (8.70 × 10−6 S
cm−1) and formed a host−guest complex with the electronaccepting molecule tetracyanoethylene (Figure 22, G12), even in
the bulk liquid state.
The other liquid pillar[n]arenes were the tri(ethylene oxide)-
modified pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes 51[5] and 15[6],
respectively (Figure 50b).97,240 These systems existed in the
liquid state over a wide range of temperatures and were stable up
to 250 °C. These systems could therefore be used as solvents for
host−guest complexation processes and the formation of
rotaxanes. Pillar[5]arenes form host−guest complexes with
linear alkanes, but their complexation abilities are generally
poor in solution systems (K = 20 M−1). However, when they are
used in bulk liquid systems, their complexation abilities improve
considerably because the guest molecules were surrounded by
excess pillar[5]arene host molecules 51[5]. The liquid bulk
system therefore represents an intelligent system for maximizing
the concentrations of the host and guest molecules. Using this
efficient complexation media, it was possible to investigate the
formation of rotaxanes using an end-capping approach. The
efficiency of the rotaxane formation process was quite high (over
92%) when the liquid pillar[5]arene 51[5] was used as a solvent
for the rotaxanation because the host−guest complex was stable
in this system.
6.2.2. Liquid Crystal Pillar[n]arenes. Nierengarten and coworkers reported the development of thermotropic liquid
crystals using a pillar[5]arene platform (Figure 51a).109
Pillar[5]arene 75[5] bearing 10 mesogenic cyanobiphenyl
moieties on both of its rims showed an enantiotropic smectic A
phase (Figure 51b). The smectic A phase was observed over a
wide temperature range from 32 to 201 °C by DSC
measurements (Figure 51c). In contrast, the unit model 5,
which consisted of two cyanobiphenyl moieties, only showed a
monotropic smectic A phase during the cooling process over a
narrow temperature range from 149 to 125 °C. Intermolecular
π−π stacking interactions between the neighboring pillar[5]-
arene cores contributed to the stabilization of the smectic A
phase (Figure 51d). In a manner similar to the pillar[5]arene
75[5], pillar[6]arene 20[6] bearing 12 cyanobiphenyl moieties
(Scheme 23) also showed a stable smectic A phase over a wide
range of temperatures.79 Wang and co-workers synthesized
pillar[5]arene-based photoresponsive liquid crystals using
pillar[5]arenes bearing 10 azobenzene moieties with different
spacer lengths (n = 4, 135[5], n = 10, 136[5], Figure 51e).241
Both of these pillar[5]arenes showed smectic liquid crystalline
phases over a wide range of temperatures (Figure 51f), as
indicated by DSC measurements (Figure 51g). Furthermore, the
lamellar periods of these systems were determined by small-/
wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) analyses to be 72.4
and 59.7 Å, respectively (Figure 51h). The lamellar distances of
these systems were about 20% shorter than they were estimated
to be on the basis of their molecular contour lengths, which
suggested a partially interdigitated packing structure. The tubular
pillar[5]arene macrocyclic platform provided sufficient free
volume to allow for the reversible photoisomerization and
photoalignment processes.


6.2.3. Crystalline Pillar[n]arenes for Gas and Organic
Vapor Adsorption. Pillar[n]arenes have high symmetrical
pillar-shaped structures and high free volumes, making them
good candidates for the preparation of porous materials for gas
and organic vapor adsorption. Yang and co-workers reported the
use of pillar[5]arene crystals as gas adsorption materials (Figure
52).147
Pillar[5]arene 12[5] bearing 10 phenolic moieties exhibited a
3D open network structure, which was stabilized by
intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions. The 3D open
network structure contained 0.5 acetone molecules, which were
removed when the crystals were heated at 170 °C. However, the
crystal structure remained unchanged even after the acetone
molecules had been removed because the 3D open network
structure was stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The
activated crystals absorbed CO2 with a high sorption ability (88
mg g−1, at 25 °C, 1 atm). In contrast, CH4 and N2 were poorly
adsorbed, indicating remarkable CO2-selectivities over CH4 (375/1) and N2 (339/1). The highly selective adsorption of CO2
observed in this case was attributed to the porous nanostructure
of the compound and the hydroxyl groups of pillar[5]arene
12[5].
Our group reported the gas and organic-vapor uptake
properties of crystalline pillar[6]arene 8[6] bearing 12 hydroxyl
moieties.242 8[6] assembled into a highly symmetrical onedimensional structure in the crystalline state (Figure 53).73
Pillar[6]arene 8[6] bearing 12 hydroxyl moieties and an even
number of benzene rings on its rims formed multiple
intramolecular hydrogen bonds in an alternating up-and-down
manner, which stabilized its hexagonal structure (Figure 53a and
b). The rigid hexagonal structure of this material assembled to
form a 2D hexagonal sheet structure along the a and b axes, and a
1D channel structure along the c axis (Figure 53c). Acetone
molecules were included in the channels, and the crystals were
consequently heated under reduced pressure to give activated
porous crystals. The 1D channels were retained even after the
removal of the acetone molecules because the structure was
stabilized by multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions in the same
way as the per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5]. This
crystalline material not only adsorbed various gases (Figure
53d) such as CO2 (3.3 Å), N2 (3.7 Å), and n-butane (4.3 Å), but
also adsorbed organic vapors (Figure 54e) such as n-hexane (4.9
Å) and cyclohexane (6.7 Å). The broad adsorption characteristics of this crystalline material were attributed to the permanent
one-dimensional pores with the same cavity size as pillar[6]arene
8[6] (ca. 6.7 Å), which was larger in size than the gases and
organic vapors described above. The pore size of the onedimensional channels was determined to be 4.10 Å using a
molecular probe technique.
We also constructed 2D hexagonal sheets using a molecular
tailing concept, where molecules with triangular, tetragonal, and
hexagonal structures can be used to form densely packed structures because of their highly symmetrical structures. It is
noteworthy, however, that pentagonal molecules cannot form
densely packed structures. On the basis of this concept, the 2D
supramolecular polymerization of hexagonal per-hydroxylated
pillar[6]arene molecules 8[6] led to the formation of 2D
hexagonal sheets.243 2D supramolecular polymerization can be
induced by the oxidation of hydroquinone to benzoquinone
units because the CT complexation process between the
hydroquinone and benzoquinone units of pillar[6]arenes results
in the intermolecular connection of pillar[6]arene molecules
(Figure 54b).
The highly ordered structure of the 2D sheets formed regular
fibrous structures CT[6]. The 2D sheets also had pores (4.04 Å),
which were derived from the original pores of the pillar[6]arene
crystals (4.10 Å). The 2D sheets were converted to carbons by
the calcination of the 2D sheets PC[6] at 900 °C for 2 h under an
inert atmosphere (Figure 54c). Even after the calcination of the
2D sheets, the fibrous structures remained intact. Furthermore,
the fibrous carbon had pores hat were similar in size to the
original starting compound pillar[6]arene assembly (4.09 Å).
This method for the creation of porous carbon does not require
inorganic templates, and therefore represents a simple process
for the synthesis of porous carbons with angstrom-sized pores.
Our group reported the occurrence of unexpected alkane
uptake behavior pronounced alkane-shape and alkene-length
selectivity using activated per-ethylated pillar[5]arene 2[5]
crystals (Figure 55).144
During the adsorption process, crystals without solvent
molecules could quantitatively take up linear n-alkanes with
gate-opening pressure. During the desorption process, the
adsorbed linear n-alkanes were not released even under reduced
pressure because they were stabilized by multiple CH/π
interactions. In contrast, the cyclic and branched alkanes were
not absorbed in the same way because the pillar[5]arene cavity
was a poor fit for these cyclic and branched alkanes.



6.2.4. Composite Materials Based on Pillar[n]arenes.
Huang and co-workers reported the preparation of composite
materials from the polymerized ionic liquid polymer and the percarboxylated pillar[5]arene 45[5] (Figure 56a).244
This composite consisted of particles in the nano range (20−
50 nm) that formed the sponge-like structure 6. Furthermore,
the composite material had a large pore volume (350 m2/g) and
selectively adsorbed alcohols, with an especially high affinity for
1,4-butanediol. In contrast, this composite showed a much lower
affinity for monoalcohols. These foundations are derived from
the host−guest ability of pillar[5]arene in the solution state.
Pillar[5]arene can form more stable host−guest complexes with
diols than it can with monoalcohols.
Stoddart and co-workers reported the construction of the
metal organic framework (MOF) 7 bearing an active pillar[5]-
arene domain (Figures 56b).87 The pillar[5]arene-based MOF 7
was prepared by heating a mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and
pillar[5]arene 60[5] carrying two carboxylic acid groups in DMF
at 100 °C for 24 h. This pillar[5]arene-based MOF selectively
adsorbed neutral and positively charged electron-deficient
aromatic guests, including the pyridinium and viologen salts
G89 and G90, as well as 1,4-dinitrobenzene (G91). The
formation of CT interactions between the guest molecules and
the active domain of the pillar[5]arenes in the MOF allowed for
this complexation process to be monitored on the basis of the
color change of the solution. MOFs containing active
enantiopure pillar[5]arene domains were also prepared by
Stoddart and co-workers.


6.3. Assembly of Pillar[n]arenes on Inorganic Surfaces
The high functionality of pillar[n]arenes can contribute to
improvements in their compatibility with a wide range of
inorganic materials, including metal nanoparticles, nanocarbons,
MOFs, and silica.
6.3.1. Metal Nanoparticles. Capping agents containing
amino, carboxyl, or sulfhydryl groups can be used to stabilize
metal particles on the nanoscale by preventing their aggregation
through the formation of coordination interaction to the metal
surface. Yang and co-workers reported gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) stabilized by pillar[5]arene with 10 carboxylate
moieties 46[5] (Figure 57a).245
Pillar[5]arene-modified AuNPs were synthesized by reducing
HAuCl4 with NaBH4 in the presence of the per-carboxylated
pillar[5]arene 46[5]. The resulting pillar[5]arene-stabilized
AuNPs showed good dispersion characteristics in aqueous
media and a narrow size distribution (3.1 ± 0.5 nm). The
pillar[5]arene molecules immobilized on the AuNPs had vacant
pores, allowing them to capture guest molecules. The addition of
the viologen guest dimer G92 led to a change in the color of this
system, with the viologen dimer acting as a cross-linking agent
between the AuNPs to induce the 1D and 3D assembly of the
pillar[5]arene-stabilized AuNPs. Huang and co-workers reported
the construction of various nanostructures from carboxylated
pillar[6]arene 13[6]-modified AuNPs bearing a paraquat guest
with a hydrophobic chain (G93).246 These host−guest
interactions resulted in the formation of numerous structures,
including supramolecular micelles, onion-like disks, and vesicles
(Figure 57b). The feed ratio of the paraquat guest G93 to the
pillar[6]arene 13[6]-modified AuNPs was found to be critical to
the formation of the various supramolecular assemblies. Park and
co-workers reported the preparation of large AuNPs using 46[5]
as a stabilizer.247 HAuCl was heated at reflux in water for 10 min
before being treated with the per-carboxylated pillar[5]arene
46[5]. The diameter of the resulting AuNPs was around 17 nm.
Furthermore, the AuNPs showed high stability toward a variety
of salts, as well as variations in the pH. Pillar[5]arenes bearing
cationic moieties are also good stabilizing agents for AuNPs.
Huang and co-workers reported that pillar[5]arene 67[5]
bearing 10 imidazolium cations could be used as a stabilizer to
form AuNPs (Figure 57c).103 The use of a pillar[5]arene bearing 10 imidazolium groups provided a shell of imidazolium cations
around the AuNPs, which inhibited the aggregation of the
AuNPs. The use of an ammonium cation-bearing pillar[5]arene
also prevented the aggregation of the AuNPs and acted as a
stabilizer.248 Zhou and co-workers reported the use of the
monofunctionalized pillar[5]arene 137[5] bearing a thiol moiety
as a stabilizer (Figure 58a).249
The surfaces of the AuNPs were covered with pillar[5]arenes,
which enabled them to capture cationic guest molecules. The
resulting pillar[5]arene-covered AuNPs were then treated with
an ammonium derivative bearing an anthracene moiety (G94),
which can undergo [4+4] cycloaddition/decycloaddition reactions when it is irradiated with UV light or heated, respectively.
The AuNPs underwent reversible aggregation and dissociation
processes when they were irradiated with UV light or heated in
the presence of G94 because of the cycloaddition/decycloaddition of this guest molecule under these conditions. In this way,
the guest molecule could be used as a switch depending on the
conditions applied to the system.
Metal nanoparticles have also been synthesized using a variety
of metals. For example, Xue and co-workers reported the
preparation of AgNPs with narrow size distributions using the
per-carboxylated pillar[5]arene 46[5] as a stabilizer (Figure
58b).250 The addition of spermine or its analogues to these
systems led to the aggregation of the AgNPs, which resulted in a
color change. This change in the color of the solution was
attributed to the spermine molecules acting as cross-linking
agents to connect the individual silver ions. This color change
could therefore be used as a visual cue for the detection of
spermine analogues in water through host−guest interactions.
Yang and co-workers synthesized per-carboxylated pillar[5]-
arene 46[5]-modified quantum dots using a ligand-exchange
method.251 Quantum dots provide strong fluorescence signals
with long lifetimes, and can therefore be used for biological
sensing and display panels. Yang et al. also reported the synthesis
of pillar[5]arene-modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which can be
used as magnetic solid-phase extraction absorbents.25


6.3.2. Nanocarbons. Nanoscale carbons such as fullerenes,
carbon nanotubes, nanodiamonds, and graphenes have attracted
considerable interest because of their unique structural, electrical,
and mechanical properties. One of the main challenges
associated with the functionalization of pillar[n]arenes on
nanocarbons is the development of efficient strategies for
increasing the solubility of nanocarbons and introducing
molecular recognition sites.
Haung and co-workers reported the dispersion of multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) using the host−guest complex
formed between the per-carboxylated pillar[6]arene 13[6] and
the neutral guest molecule G95 bearing a pyrene moiety (Figure
59).160
MWNTs did not disperse in aqueous media with a neutral
guest, but dispersed well in the presence of the per-carboxylated
pillar[6]arene 13[6]⊃neutral guest G95 complex under ultrasonic irradiation. This complex contained both hydrophobic and
hydrophilic moieties, and was therefore capable of dispersing
MWNTs in aqueous media. The MWNT dispersion was also pH
responsive, in the sense that making the pH of the mixture acidic
resulted in the precipitation of the MWNTs. Notably, the
precipitate dispersed in aqueous media when the pH of the
mixture was taken back to being neutral. Haung et al. also reported the photoresponsive dispersion/precipitation of
MWNTs using a photoresponsive host−guest complex.163 In
this case, they used a guest molecule bearing pyrene and
lutidinium moieties that were connected via a photocleavable 2-
nitrobenzyl ester group. The MWNTs were dispersed in an
aqueous solution with a host−guest complex formed between
per-carboxylated pillar[6]arene and a UV-responsive guest. The
MWNTs precipitated from solution following the irradiation of
the mixture with UV light because of the dissociation of the
photocleavage guest.
Diao and co-workers reported the dispersion of reduced
graphene oxide in aqueous media using the amphiphilic
nonsymmetric pillar[5]arene 138[5] bearing five hydrophilic
amino groups on one rim and five hydrophobic alkyl chains on
the other rim (Figure 60). A dispersion of graphene oxide in aqueous media was treated
with 138[5], and the resulting mixture was sonicated. The
mixture was then treated with hydrazine hydrate to give an
aqueous dispersion of reduced graphene oxide−138[5] hybrids.
It is noteworthy that this reduction process resulted in the
formation of a precipitate when it was conducted without
138[5]. The self-assembly of 138[5] on the surface of the
reduced graphene oxide made a considerable contribution to the
formation of the water-dispersed reduced graphene oxide−
138[5] hybrids. Zhao and co-workers reported the application of
water-soluble pillar[n]arene-functionalized graphene oxide for in
vitro Raman and fluorescence dual mode imaging experiments.254
Water-dispersed reduced graphene oxide−pillar[5]arene
hybrids can be also prepared by connecting reduced graphene
to pillar[5]arene 45[5] via the formation of covalent ester bonds
(Figure 60d).255 Water-dispersed hybrids were obtained by the
formation of ester bonds between the hydroxyl moieties of
graphene oxide and the carboxylic acid groups on per-carboxylic
acid pillar[5]arene 45[5]. The resulting solution was homogeneous even after the complete reduction of graphene oxide


6.3.3. Metal Organic Frameworks. Yang and co-workers
reported the occurrence of pH-dependent and competitive
guest-responsive cargo release from nano-MOFs covered with
the per-carboxylated pillar[5]arene 46[5] through a host−guest
complexation process (Figure 61).256
The treatment of a nano-MOF material with the pyridinium
guest molecule allowed for the synthesis of the corresponding
nano-MOF−pyridinium guest complex. The surface of the nanoMOF−pyridinium guest complex 8 was then capped with percarboxylic acid pillar[5]arene 46[5] after loading of the cargo.
Under acidic conditions, the system released the cargo from the
nano-MOF. The addition of viologen as a competitive agent also
led to the release of the cargo.
6.3.4. Silica. Yang and co-workers reported the functionalization of pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arene molecules with silica particles
through the formation of a covalent bond between the two
materials (Figure 62a).257
The silica surface was initially activated with SiCl4, and then
treated with the per-hydroxylated pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes
12[5] and 8[6] to allow for the immobilization of these materials
on the silica surface. These pillar[5,6]arene-modified silica
particles adsorbed paraquat in aqueous media. The pillar[6]-
arene-modified silica particles adsorbed approximately twice as
much paraquat as the corresponding pillar[5]arene-modified
silica particles.
Our group previously reported the construction of pillar[5]-
arene-based multilayer films on a silica substrate (Figure 62b).258
The multilayer films were obtained using a layer-by-layer
assembly method, which is generally used for the construction
of polymer-based thin films by the consecutive adsorption of
oppositely charged polyelectrolytes on a silica surface. Pillar[5]-
arene-based multilayer materials were obtained by alternating the
adsorption steps with the cationic pillar[5]arene 139[5] and the
anionic pillar[5]arene 46[5]. The unique pillar-shaped structures
and the presence of functional groups on both rims of the
pillar[5]arenes contributed to the successful formation of
multilayer films using pillar[5]arenes based on a layer-by-layer
assembly. The resulting films possessed the molecular
recognition abilities of pillar[5]arenes, in that the films only
adsorbed 1,4-dinitrobenzene and did not exhibit any adsorption ability toward 1,2- or 1,3-dinitrobenzene. In addition, the surface
electrostatic potential of these systems resulted in their molecular
recognition ability. 1,4-Dinitrobenzene was adsorbed on the
surfaces of films with a cationic surface, but not on the surfaces of
films with an anionic surface. The amount of 1,4-dinitrobenzene
adsorbed onto the surfaces of these systems could be tuned, with
the amount of adsorbed 1,4-dinitrobenzene increasing with an
increase in the number of deposited layers.


7. MECHANICALLY INTERLOCKED MOLECULES
7.1. Rotaxanes
Rotaxanes, using pillar[5]arene wheels, were initially investigated
using simple linear alkanes as the station. The first pillar[5]arenebased rotaxane was reported by Stoddart et al.82 On the basis of
the formation of a host−guest complex between per-methylated
pillar[5]arene 1[5] and alkanediamines, they investigated endcapping reactions of the complex between diaminoocatane G46
and 1[5] with an aldehyde-end stopper 9 to form [2]rotaxane 10
(Figure 63).
The subsequent reduction of the diamine with NaBH4
afforded the [2]rotaxane 10, but its yield was low (7%) due to
the weak host−guest complexation between G46 and 1[5] (K =
70 ± 10 M−1). Huang and co-workers synthesized [2]rotaxanes
based on pillar[5]arene/alkane recognition by esterification
reactions,259,260 in yields of 16−35%. The driving forces for the
host−guest complexation are weak CH/π interactions; thus,
these yields were considered to be reasonable. We reported the
high yield synthesis of pillar[5]arene-based rotaxanes using a
good cationic axle for pillar[5]arenes.261 We used a pyridinium
derivative as an axle and the CuAAC reaction for the end-capping dethreading of the pillar[5]arene wheel, but also produces
another equal energy level station.
Stoddart and co-workers synthesized [4]- and [5]-
heterorotaxanes consisting of heteromacrocyclic hosts, pillar[5]-
arene and CB[6] wheels, or pillar[6]arene and CB[6] wheels
(Figures 66 and 67).264
The per-hydroxylated pillar[n]arenes have hydrogen donor
OH groups at both rims. CB[6] has CO moieties as hydrogen
acceptors. Therefore, mixing these heteromacrocyclic wheels in
the presence of an axle resulted in a high level of preorganization
for the rotaxanation by means of the multiple hydrogen-bonding
interactions between CO moieties of CB[6] and phenol
moieties of pillar[n]arenes. When per-hydroxylated pillar[5]-
reaction (Figure 64).
Pyridinium derivatives form stable host−guest complexes with
pillar[5]arenes driven by cationic/π interactions (K > 104 M−1).
CuAAC reaction between the alkyne-end of pseudo[2]rotaxane,
composed of axle 11, with wheel 2[5] and azido-stopper 12
afforded the [2]rotaxane 13 in high yield (75%). Rotation of the
pillar[5]arene wheel in the [2]rotaxane was completely inhibited
due to the existence of the axle in the rotaxane. From 1H NMR
measurement, the conformation of the pillar[5]arene wheel was
assigned as the a and a′ forms. The substituents on the
pillar[5]arene rims are ethoxy moieties. There are no strong
intramolecular interactions between the ethoxy moieties; thus
conformers a and a′ are the most stable conformers in
[2]rotaxane. The ratio of a:a′ conformers in [2]rotaxane was
50:50. A new challenge is the enantioselective synthesis of
pillar[n]arene rotaxanes. The high yield synthesis of a [2]-
rotaxane using a cationic imidazolium axle was reported by
Huang and co-workers.262 The [2]rotaxane showed solvent- and
thermo-driven molecular motions and supramolecular gel
formation.



We used the CuAAC reaction for the efficient end-capping
reactions to produce the [2]rotaxane in high yield. However, the
C4 linker with two 1,2,3-triazole groups, which was generated by
the CuAAC reaction of alkyne and azide moieties, was a good
guest station (K > 104 M−1).111 We synthesized pillar[5]arenebased [2]rotaxanes based on multiple CuAAC reactions (Figure
65).263 The multiple CuAAC reactions generated a good station,
n-butylene with two 1,2,3-triazole moieties at both ends.
First, the CuAAC reaction of 1,4-diazidobutane with excess
1,7-octadiene afforded an axle containing one station and two
alkyne moieties at both ends of axle 14 (Figure 65a). Second, the
CuAAC reaction between the axle 14 and azido-stopper 15 in the
presence of pillar[5]arene 2[5] afforded [2]rotaxane 16 in
moderate yield (54%). In contrast, when 1,7-octadiene was
reacted with excess 1,4-diazidobutane by the CuAAC reaction, an
axle with two azide moieties 17 was afforded (Figure 65b). There
were no good stations for pillar[5]arene in the axle. The CuAAC
reaction between the axle 17 and alkyne-stopper 18 in the
presence of pillar[5]arene 2[5] then resulted in [2]rotaxane
containing two stations with equal energy levels 19 that exhibited
shuttling of the pillar[5]arene wheel between the stations. In this
reaction, the first CuAAC reaction produces one good station,
the butylene with two triazole ends. Thus, formation of
[2]pseudorotaxane occurred. The second CuAAC reaction
then achieves not only the end-capping reaction to inhibit the arene 12[5] was used as the wheel, axles containing a viologen
moiety 20−22 were suitable for the synthesis of rotaxanes. The
CuAAC reaction of the preorganized pseudorotaxane structure,
consisting of pillar[5]arene 12[5], and viologen axle with
stopper-CB[6] complex 24, yielded two [4]rotaxanes and one
[5]rotaxane in >90% yields. When short spacers were used
between viologen and azide moieties 20 (n = 1) and 21 (n = 2),
[4]rotaxanes (25 and 26) containing two CB[6] and one
pillar[5]arene wheels were obtained in >95% yields. In contrast,
when a long spacer 22 (n = 3) was used, a [5]rotaxane containing
two CB[6] and two pillar[5]arene wheels 27 was produced in
>90% yield. These results indicate that the long alkyl spacer is
sufficient to include two pillar[5]arene wheels, but the short alkyl
spacer is not. In the case of a longer spacer 23 (n = 4), a
hetero[5]rotaxane 28 containing two pillar[5]arene wheels was
produced, but its yield decreased (30%) because the length of the
spacer is too long to form a stable preorganized pseudorotaxane
structure. Another interesting aspect of the heterorotaxane
formation was that the preorganization also accelerated the
reaction rate of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions between azides and
alkynes. Thus, the formation of these rotaxanes proceeded even
without a Cu(I) catalyst. The conformations of the pillar[5]arene
wheels in the rotaxanes were the C5-symmetric a/a′ forms as the
major component, but also contained b/b′ and c/c′ forms as
minor components. Conformational isomer d/d′, which is the
most stable conformation in per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene
12[5] due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonds, was not
found.27 A possible reason for this is the number of the phenolic
moieties without intramolecular hydrogen bonds. a/a′, b/b′, and
c/c′ forms have more than six phenolic groups, which can form
intermolecular hydrogen bonds between pillar[5]arene and
CB[6] wheels to stabilize the preorganized pseudorotaxane
structure. However, the d/d′ conformers only have two phenolic
groups, which can participate in intermolecular hydrogen
bonding with CB[6].



The same group expanded the idea for the efficient synthesis of
pillar[6]arene-based hetero[4]rotaxanes consisting of one axle,
two CB[6] rings, and one pillar[6]arene ring (Figure 67).265
In axles containing a viologen station, which were used for the
synthesis of heterorotaxanes containing pillar[6]arene and
CB[6] rings (Figure 67, 20 and 21), the yields of the
hetero[4]rotaxanes (30 and 31) were not high (38−39%).
However, when an axle contained a ter-phenyl moiety 29, the
yield of the hetero[4]rotaxane 32 was increased (68%). A
possible explanation is that the ter-phenyl moiety should fit into
the cavity of pillar[6]arene. The rotation of units of the
pillar[6]arene ring in the hetero[4]rotaxanes was not inhibited
at room temperature due to the large cavity of pillar[6]arene.
Pillar[6]arene has 13 conformers (Figure 9c). The most stable
conformation of per-hydroxylated pillar[6]arene in the hetero-
[4]rotaxane 32 obtained from calculation was the alternating upto-down arrangement (g form), which is the most stable
structure in per-hydroxylated pillar[6]arene because all 12
phenolic moieties can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds.
The X-ray crystal structure of the [4]rotaxane 32 also supported
the results from calculations (Figure 67b). The conformation of
the pillar[6]arene ring in the hetero[4]rotaxane 32 exhibited an
up-to-down arrangement. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds were
also found between the pillar[6]arene and CB[6] rings to form a
stable preorganized pseudorotaxane structure.
Rotaxanes having various structures and functions have been
constructed using a pillar[5]arene wheel. Huang and co-workers
reported a doubly threaded rotaxane dimer 33 with two stable
structures by end-capping of the double-threaded dimer (Figure
68a).266
In chloroform, the dimer 33 formed a contracted state with a
length of 31 Å because the NH/π interactions are stronger than
CH/π interactions in the nonpolar chloroform solvent.
However, the dimer 33 formed an extended state with a length
of 37 Å in the polar solvent DMSO, because NH/π interactions
are weaker than CH/π interactions in the polar DMSO solvent.
Gallani and Nierengarten reported amphiphilic pillar[5]arenecontaining [2]rotaxane 34 (Figure 68b).267 The [2]rotaxane 34
consisted of a hydrophobic axle, a pillar[5]arene wheel, and a
hydrophilic stopper. Because of the good hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, stable Langmuir films were obtained. Xue and coworkers synthesized a pillar[5]arene-based [1]rotaxane by
preorganization of [2]pseudorotaxane structure by means of
CH/π and cationic/anionic electrostatic interactions (Figure
68c).167 Proton transfer from monocarboxylic acid pillar[5]arene
115[5] to a linear alkane with a primary amine moiety at one end
G51 contributed to the formation of the highly preorganized
[2]pseudorotaxane structure. Amidation between the primary
amine group on the guest and the carboxylic acid group on the
pillar[5]arene then gave [1]rotaxane 35 in high yield (73%).
We constructed an efficient FRET system based on the
[2]rotaxane structure (Figure 69a).268 A CuAAC reaction of an axle containing a bulky trityl moiety at
one end and an alkyne at the other end 36, with an azide-perylene
stopper 37 in the presence of a pillar[5]arene wheel with two
pyrene moieties at the A1/A2 positions 92[5], afforded a
[2]rotaxane 38 (yield 80%). The [2]rotaxane 38 exhibited a
strong emission from the perylene by excitation of pyrene
moieties in the wheel, indicating that FRET occurred from
pyrene of the wheel to perylene in the axle. The emission
intensity of [2]rotaxane 38 was approximately 26 and 20 times
larger than that of the dumbbell 39 and a mixture of wheel 92[5]
and dumbbell 39, respectively, due to the pyrene moiety of the
wheel being fixed closely to the perylene moiety in the axle by
rotaxanation.
A pillar[6]arene-based [2]rotaxane was first prepared by our
group (Figure 69b).269 The same axle 36 to produce the
pillar[5]arene-based FRET [2]rotaxane was used for the
synthesis of pillar[6]arene-based [2]rotaxane 42 even though
the association constant of the complex between pillar[6]arene
and the axle was low (K = 19.1 ± 2.2 M−1) due to the size
mismatch between the pyridinium moiety and cavity size of
pillar[6]arene. The AuAAC reaction between the axle 36 and
bulky trityl stopper with azide moiety 40 in the presence of
pillar[6]arene 1[6] afforded pillar[6]arene-based [2]rotaxane 42
in 14% yield. The axle consists of two types of alkyl linkers, short
and long linkers in the axle. The association constant of the axle
and pillar[6]arene was weak; thus, the pillar[6]arene wheel in the
[2]rotaxane moved along the axle. As the temperature increased,
the pillar[6]arene wheel moved from the short alkyl linker to the
long alkyl linker due to the ΔS dominance.


7.2. Catenanes
Catenanes, which comprise two or more macrocycles, have been
synthesized using pillar[5]arenes as constituent macrocycles.
Our group reported a simple [2]catenane using a pillar[5]arene
ring 2[5] and a pyridinium derivative bearing alkene groups at
both ends 43 (Figure 70a).270 A ring-closing metathesis reaction
of the alkene groups in the pyridinium derivative in the presence
of pillar[5]arene ring 2[5] resulted in the formation of a
[2]catenane 44. Pseudo[1]catenane 140[5], in which the guest
alkyl cyclic chain connected to one pillar[5]arene unit, can be
produced by the CuAAC reaction between difunctionalized
pillar[5]arene with alkyne moieties at the A1/A2 positions 90[5]
and 1,12-diazidododecane (Figure 70b).
Pseudo[1]catenane formed a self-inclusion complex in
chloroform, and had two enantiomers, the in-a and in-a′ forms.
The enantiomers were isolated by chiral column chromatography. Planar chiral inversion from in-a to out-a′ or from in-a′ to
out-a occurred by the addition of competitive guests and in
linear-shaped solvents such as dichloromethane and acetonitrile.271 Liu and co-workers synthesized mechanically self-locked
chiral gemini-catenanes 45 (Figure 70c). Amidation between
A1/A2 difunctionalized pillar[5]arene with two carboxylic acid
moieties 57[5] and 1,8-diaminooctane afforded pseudo[1]-
catenane and self-locked gemini-catenanes with a/a or a′/a′
forms of pillar[5]arenes (enantiomers) and a/a′ form of
pillar[5]arenes (meso-form).272 The combination of different
host molecules enables the construction of catenanes and their
derivatives. Huang and co-workers reported the supramolecular
structural change from pseudo[2]rotaxane to pseudo[1]-
catenane (Figure 71a). They synthesized the A1/A2 difunctionalized pillar[5]arene with two crown ether units 141[5].273 A
pseudo[1]catenane-like structure can be constructed by the
threading followed by complexation method.
First, [2]pseudorotaxane was obtained by complexation
between 141[5] and diaminoalkane. Addition of acid then led
to the formation of a diammonium salt. The host−guest complex
with the crown ether moieties between ammonium salts, induced
upon addition of acid, was triggered to form a pseudo[1]-
catenane-like structure.
Ma, Li, Jiang, Wen, and co-workers synthesized a bicyclic host
consisting of a pillar[5]arene and a 1,5-dioxynaphthalene-based
crown ether unit 142[5] (Figure 71b). The bicyclic host had the
ability to capture two different guest molecules selectively and
simultaneously.274,275 The pillar[5]arene ring formed a complex
with an imidazolium cation, and the crown ether ring
accommodated a viologen moiety. On the basis of the highly
selective molecular recognition of the bicyclic compound,
topologically novel mechanically interlocked molecules such as
[2]rotaxane 46, [2]catenane 47, and [2]rota[2]catenane 48 can
be created.27


7.3. Polyrotaxanes
Polyrotaxanes, in which many wheels are threaded onto a linear
polymer chain, can be synthesized using pillar[5]arenes as
wheels. Pillar[5]arenes form stable host−guest complexes with
cationic molecules; thus, we investigated host−guest complexation between per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5] and a
viologen polymer (Figure 72a).277
When per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5] was mixed with
viologen polymer, formation of a polypseudorotaxane was
observed (Figure 72b). By capping the chain ends with bulky
adamantyl moieties through cationization, the first pillar[5]-
arene-based polyrotaxane 49 was successfully prepared (Figure
72c).278
The emeraldine base form of polyaniline is the half-oxidized
state, and thus can be oxidized upon the addition of oxidants, and
reduced upon addition of reductants. Per-hydroxylated pillar[5]-
arene 12[5] consists of reductant hydroquinone units, and thus
can be used as a macrocyclic reductant. When reductant 12[5]
was mixed with the emeraldine form of polyaniline, the blue
solution color of the emeraldine form of polyaniline became
colorless (Figure 73a).his result indicates that the emeraldine form of polyaniline,
which has a blue color, completely oxidized to a leucoemeraldine
form of polyaniline, which is colorless. In contrast, a blue solution
color still remained even with the same amount of reductant
hydroquinone, indicating that pillar[5]arene 12[5] showed a
stronger reducing ability than the unit model of hydroquinone.
This arises from the formation of the polypseudorotaxane
structure between polyaniline and pillar[5]arene 12[5].
Pseudorotaxanation is ideal for the reductant pillar[5]arene
12[5], which is close to the oxidized substrate of the emeraldine
form of the polyaniline chain.
Pillar[5]arenes form host−guest complexes with linear
alkanes; thus formation of the polypseudorotaxane structure
between pillar[5]arene 5[5] and polyethylene was investigated
by our group (Figure 73b).280 Polyethylene is hardly soluble in
organic solvents; thus pillar[5]arene and polyethylene were
mixed in the melted state. The formation of the polypseudorotaxane structures led to the extension of polyethylene chains,
which contributed to increasing the melting point of poly ethylene from 126 to 152 °C. The melting point change was
directly observed by phase transitions from the melted state to
the solid state upon addition of pillar[5]arene at 140 °C.
Addition of the competitive guest, 1,4-dibromobutane, induced
the phase transition from solid to melted state at 140 °C. This
arises from the dethreading of the polyethylene chain from the
cavity of 5[5]. These phase transitions could be applied to the
new molding and processing techniques of polyethylene.
Wang and co-workers reported dynamic polyrotaxanes using a
[2]rotaxane with ureidopyrimidinone moieties that contribute
not only as an end-capping stopper but also to supramolecular
polymerization of [2]rotaxane (Figure 74).281
The [2]rotaxane 50 was prepared by end-capping of an axle
with quadruple hydrogen-bonding ureidopyrimidinone in the
presence of a pillar[5]arene wheel. The [2]rotaxane formed a
polyrotaxane-like supramolecular polymer in high concentration
by intermolecular quadruple hydrogen bonds between the
ureidopyrimidinone moieties.
Pillar[5]arenes form host−guest complexes with cationic
guest molecules, but are hardly formed with neutral guests.
Therefore, the synthesis of polyrotaxanes consisting of nonionic polymers was difficult. To overcome this problem, we applied
liquid pillar[5]arenes to synthesize nonionic polymer-based
polyrotaxanes (Figure 75).282
The end-capping reaction between azido-end polytetrahydrofuran and alkyne-stopper 18 in liquid pillar[5]arenes (51[5]
and 143[5]) resulted in the formation of polyrotaxanes (51 and
52) in moderate yields. Using a new liquid pillar[5]arene with
reactive vinyl moieties 143[5], the pillar[5]arene-based topological gel 53 was obtained by intermolecular cross-linking
between polyrotaxanes by a metathesis reaction. The topological
gel swelled in organic solvents with intermediate dielectric
constants, but not in nonpolar or highly polar solvents.


8. MATERIAL APPLICATIONS OF PILLAR[n]ARENES
8.1. Electronic Materials
Per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5] has five hydroquinone
units. Thus, oxidation of per-hydroxylated pillar[5]arene 12[5]
afforded pillar[5]quinone containing five benzoquinone units
144[5] (Figure 76a).283 Hydroquinone is converted to
benzoquinone by oxidation, and benzoquinone is converted
back to hydroquinone by reduction. There are a total of 10
carbonyl groups with high density on both rims of pillar[5]-
quinone; thus the macrocyclic structure of 144[5] is expected to
favor Li uptake. Chen and co-workers investigated 144[5] as the
cathode for lithium organic batteries.284 The 55 wt %
pillar[5]quinone cathode showed excellent electrode properties:
an average operation voltage of approximately 2.6 V, and high
initial capacity (418 mAh/g) with a stable cyclability (94.7% of
the initial capacity retained even after 50 cycles).
Cheng and Kaifer reported the cathodic voltammetric
behavior of pillar[5]quinone 144[5] in nonaqueous media.285
Four waves were observed by square wave voltammetry in the
voltammetric reduction cycle of 144[5], which corresponded to
2, 1, 2, and 3 electrons (Figure 76a). Uptake of the first electron
occurred, and then uptake of the second electron proceeded at a
very similar potential as the uptake of the first electron.
Therefore, the number of electrons attributed to the first waves
was two. To minimize the repulsive forces, negative charges
should locate in A and C benzoquinone units (Figure 76b).
Uptake of the third electron should proceed in the D
benzoquinone unit to minimize the repulsive forces. In this stage,
uncharged benzoquinone units were at the B and E positions;
thus uptake of last two electrons proceeded at very similar
potentials. Kudo et al. investigated novel resist materials using
pillar[5]arene platform.286 A pillar[5]arene derivative with
adamantyl moieties connected by ester bonds showed high
lithographic performance, and is thus a promising candidate for
high-resolution resist materials as well as noria, calix[n]arene
dimers, and CDs.



8.2. Artificial Transmembrane Channels
Hou et al. have developed various unimolecular artificial channels
using the tubular-shape of pillar[5]arenes.287 Their chemistry
started from the crystal structure of pillar[5]arene with 10 ethyl
ester moieties 44[5] (Figure 77a). The decaester moleculesassembled into infinite 1D channels, and ordered water wires
were observed in the 1D channels (Figure 77b).143
Because of the assembled structure of the decaester working as
proton channels, they incorporated the decaester in the lipid
bilayer to serve as proton channels.288 The decaester worked as
proton channels even in the lipid bilayer, and the conductance
using the decaester was 44 pS. However, the thickness of the lipid
bilayer is approximately 3.7 nm, which is more than twice as long
as the decaester pillar[5]arene (1.6 nm). Assembly of two
pillar[5]arene molecules is required to act as stable proton
channels (Figure 77d). The authors therefore synthesized
pillar[5]arene dimers with various length linkers 145[5]−
150[5] (Figure 77c). The pillar[5]arene dimer with C3 linker
147[5] was most applicable to the thickness of the liquid bilayer
among pillar[5]arene dimers with various lengths. Thus, the
pillar[5]arene dimer linked by the C3 linker 147[5] exhibited
similar proton conductance and high channel stability as
compared to the monomeric decaester, while pillar[5]arene
dimers connected by short (C1) 145[5] and long (C6) 150[5]
linkers minimized the intramolecular stacking interactions of the
two pillar[5]arene units (Figure 77e).
Water channels were also constructed by attaching hydrazide
chains to pillar[5]arene rims (151[5] and 152[5], Figure
78a).289
In the crystal structure, the tubular structure of pillar[5]arene
151[5] was stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds of
adjacent hydrazine subunits. In the cavity, hydrogen-bonded
water dimers were observed. The length of the extended
hydrazide-modified pillar[5]arene 152[5] is approximately 5 nm,
which is sufficient to span the lipid bilayer. 152[5] could insert
into lipid vesicles containing aqueous NaCl solution. Insertion of
the tubular structure into the lipid vesicles caused water to flux
into the vesicles due to the reduction of osmotic pressure
difference between the outside and inside of the vesicles, and
triggered swelling of the vesicles and fusion between different
vesicles.
Peptide-appended pillar[6]arene 23[6] acted as chiral
selective transport channels of amino acids by insertion of
23[6] into lipid bilayer membranes (Figure 79a).290
Transport of D-amino acids from the inside to outside of the
lipid bilayer was faster than that of L-amino acids (Figure 79b and
c). Hou et al. also synthesized per-functionalized pillar[5]arene
with Arg-incorporated tripeptide chains 153[5] (Figure 79a).291
Under a negative potential, 153[5] inserted into a lipid bilayer to
form channels for the transport of K+ ions. In contrast, under a
positive potential, 153[5] left the lipid bilayer, which resulted in the nontransport of K+ ions (Figure 79d). Therefore, transportation of K+ ions can be switched by voltage control.


9. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
Research in the field of pillar[n]arene chemistry started in 2008;
thus pillar[n]arene chemistry only has a short history of 8 years.
However, even in 8 years, the chemistry has developed
exponentially as this field has garnered tremendous attention
of many chemists. In the initial stage from 2008 to 2011, there
were only a handful of researchers. However, their considerable
efforts uncovered the fundamental properties of cyclic
pentamers, pillar[5]arenes, such as synthesis, structure,
functionality, conformational, and host−guest properties. For
example, etherification of preformed pillar[5]arenes, such as perhydroxylated pillar[5]arene, was the first approach to obtain perfunctionalizing pillar[5]arenes. The first water-soluble pillar[5]-
arene was prepared in 2010 by the etherification approach.88 The
discovery of water-soluble pillar[5]arene was a turning point in
the host−guest chemistry of pillar[5]arenes, which enabled
aqueous media to be chosen as the complexation media in
addition to organic media. The per-functionalization of pillar[5]-
arenes by the etherification approach also enabled the inhibition
of the rotation of the units through the introduction of bulky
substituents. Inhibition of the rotation of the units completely
opened the area of planar chirality of pillar[5]arene in 2011.91 In
2010, Huang and co-workers developed a cocyclization approach
to obtain pillar[5]arene with one different unit.81 In 2011,
Stoddart and co-workers synthesized monofunctionalized
pillar[5]arenes based on the cocyclization approach.82 The
appearance of monofunctionalized pillar[5]arenes led to the
construction of a wide variety of pillar[5]arene-based supramolecular polymers. From 2012, the moderate yield synthesis of
cyclic hexamers, pillar[6]arenes, has expanded the fields of
pillar[n]arene chemistry.59 Photo- and redox-responsive host−
guest systems using pillar[6]arenes were a major breakthrough to apply the host−guest chemistry of pillar[n]arene for supramolecular structural switching.136,179 That is, the development of
pillar[n]arene chemistry was supported by a genuine team effort
from pillar[n]arene chemists all over the world. Their efforts
triggered the next exponential increase in the development of
pillar[n]arene chemistry from 2012. Fortunately, many chemists
have joined the pillar[n]arene chemistry community, and
contributed to uncovering new potentials of pillar[n]arenes by
applying pillar[n]arenes to different fields of chemistry, such as
inorganic, polymer, biomedical, and electrical chemistry. Now,
pillar[n]arenes are attracting attention from numerous researchers, and are recognized as one of the key components in
supramolecular chemistry. From the history of the development
of pillar[n]arene chemistry, discovery of the original pillar[n]-
arene features is very important for the further success of
pillar[n]arene chemistry. Their beautiful pillar-shaped and
regular polygonal structures should be important aspects for
the construction of highly ordered original pillar[n]arene
assemblies. The hydrocarbon-recognition ability of pillar[n]-
arenes by multiple CH/π interactions should lead to yet
unknown molecular storage and separation materials. Application of pillar[n]arenes of mechanically and thermally tough
supramolecular polymers and electronic materials should be a
future target. Application of the pillar[n]arenes, based on the
original features of pillar[n]arenes, will lead to further breakthroughs, which might extend the field beyond the present
concept of supramolecular chemistry. The structure of pillar[n]-
arenes is very simple; thus we believe that the pillar[n]arenes
should have unlimited potential, serve as ideal platforms to
construct supramolecular materials, and continue to be widely
researched and loved within the ever expanding community.
Pillar[n]arenes still have an infinite number of possibilities, and
look forward to future discoveries in pillar[n]arene chemistry.
