Due to their rigid structures and ef /uniFB01 cient binding af /uniFB01 nities, cucurbit[ n ]urils, combined with a variety of /uniFB02 uorescent guests, have gained extensive utilization in /uniFB02 uorescentindicator displacement assays for sensing non/uniFB02 uorescent or weakly /uniFB02 uorescent organic compounds (analytes) in a selective and speci /uniFB01 c manner.

        "content": "Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) (Metzger and Anslyn, 1998; Wiskur et al., 2001; Nguyen and Anslyn, 2006) have been a favored approach for achieving synthetic-receptor conversion into optical sensors in the supramolecular chemistry realm. IDAs, which exploit the non-covalent interplays of the host with analyte/indicator, have been applied to the sensing of diverse analytes (e.g., metal anions, cations, pharmaceuticals, and other biological molecules) (Rather and Ali, 2021; Sedgwick et al., 2021). IDAs are recognized as a crucial and practical strategy, especially in /uniFB02 uorescence-sensing applications. As the initial step of this approach, an inclusion complex is created between an appropriate indicator dye and an adequate macrocyclic host. In this way, arbitrary (mostly photophysical) traits of the dye molecules are either attenuated or enhanced. Upon application of this inclusion complex for the analyte detection in the solution, the dye s modulated traits are reversed since the dye is displaced from the host ' cavity through competitive analyte -host binding (Bakirci and Nau, 2006; Nguyen and Anslyn, 2006; Praetorius et al., 2008; Dsouza et al., 2011; Jadhav et al., 2015; Norouzy et al., 2015; Sayed et al., 2016; Sayed and Pal, 2016). The utilization of /uniFB02 uorescent dyes in such IDAs is often regarded as profoundly useful in view of the appreciable system response to the analytes under these scenarios via either /uniFB02 uorescence ' turn-off ' or ' turn-on ' sequences (see Figure 1). This approach is de /uniFB01 ned uniquely as Fluorescent-IDAs (F-IDAs).",

As the /uniFB02 uorescent guests ' photophysical traits are alterable by the CB n hosts (Dsouza et al., 2011), the application of CB n for host -guest complex creation has been reported, and these complexes have gained further utilization for sensing or determining non/uniFB02 uorescent or weakly /uniFB02 uorescent organic compounds (analytes) via F-IDAs (Ghale and Nau, 2014).\nPQ is resent, there is a displacement of probe MB from the MB2 ⊂ CB8 complex, as the competitive binding interaction of PQ with the CB8 host is more powerful. In response to the existence of PQ, MB is discharged, resulting in an immensely-enhanced /uniFB02 uorescence.\nIn our current mini-review, we detail recent advances in the application of a variety of CB n analytically applied to achieve the /uniFB02 uorescence intensity quenching or enhancement for various guest molecules and the design of F-IDAs induced by CB n based on the quenching or enhancement of /uniFB02 uorescence signals for the analyte assessment purpose.

DAP exhibited a 200-fold enhancement in its /uniFB02 uorescence intensity after binding to CB7, as well as a turn-off of signal following ammonium product-induced displacement. Given the stronger af /uniFB01 nity of CB7 for cationic alkylammonium products than amino acids, the amino acid incorporation failed to interfere with the F-IDA. In another study, a labelfree F-IDA strategy was designed by Nau and co-workers to achieve realtime continuous protease activity surveillance on unlabeled peptides, where CB7 and AO were utilized as the macrocyclic host and /uniFB02 uorescent guest, respectively (Ghale et al., 2011). CB7 was responsible for selectively identifying the cleavage products, which bear an N-terminal phenylalanine residue. AO was responsible for the reaction signaling after being selectively displaced from CB7 by the high-af /uniFB01 nity proteolysis product. An established inhibitor phosphoramidon was adopted to verify the protease inhibition quantifying the capacity of the proposed F-IDA strategy. Wang et al.
