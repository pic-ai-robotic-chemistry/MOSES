        "content": "Fluorescent indicator displacement assays (F-IDAs) are typically used to convert synthetic receptors into optical sensors in supramolecular chemistry. In F-IDAs, the competitive binding principle is used: after binding a /uniFB02 uorescent indicator to the receptor, when a competing analyte is introduced into the indicator -receptor pair, the indicator is discharged from the receptor to induce a /uniFB02 uorescence change (Wiskur, et al., 2001;Nguyen and Anslyn, 2006). Macrocyclic hosts typically provide ideal receptors for use because of their particular composition and excellent functions. The macrocyclic hosts, such as cyclodextrins (Crini, 2014; Pal, et al., 2015), calixarenes (Koh, et al., 1996; Hennig, et al., 2007; Guo and Liu, 2014; Zheng, et al., 2018), cucurbiturils (Florea and Nau, 2011; Praetorius, et al., 2008; Barrow, et al., 2015; Sonzini, et al., 2017) and pillararenes (Wang P, et al., 2014; Bojtár, et al., 2015; Bojtár, et al., 2016; Hua, et al., 2016; Bojtár, et al., 2017; Hua, et al., 2018; Xiao, et al., 2018, Xiao, et al., 2019a; Xiao, et al., 2019b), combined with various dyes have been applied as receptors in F-IDAs for speci /uniFB01 c and selective sensing in drugs, biomolecules, or other organic compounds.",

        "content": "This study established an FID assay with a water-soluble pillararene for caffeine detection. Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychostimulant drug worldwide. Appropriate caffeine intake may enhance alertness, attention, and nerve cell activity and decrease the possibility of type 2 diabetes. However, excessive intake of caffeine may possibly cause a headache, high blood pressure, irregular small muscle movement, and allergy, especially in teenagers and pregnant women (Nehlig, et al., 1992; Rapuri, et al., 2001; Smith, 2002; Lovallo et al., 2005). Caffeine detection can be realised with costly and complex methods, such as HPLC-MS and immunoassay (Wu, et al., 2000; Oberleitner, et al., 2014). Therefore, caffeine detection remains inconvenient for public usage. Thus, we realised novel host -guest recognition between water-soluble pillararene (WP6) and safranine T (ST) and revealed the operation of this host -guest recognition motif as an FID assay in caffeine detection ( Scheme 1 ). The assay seems selective for theophylline and theobromine.\nDecember 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 816069",

        "content": "To study the host -guest complexation between WP6 and ST, 1 H NMR spectroscopy was /uniFB01 rst performed. Given that the complex solubility of neat D2O did not occur at the mM scale, DMSOd 6 cosolvent was supplemented. According to Figure 1 , ST aromatic protons in the complex shifted up /uniFB01 eld to varying degrees. This result revealed that ST was encapsulated by WP6 cavity and protons on ST were shielded by the electron-rich cyclic structure when the inclusion complex formed (Wang Y. et al., 2014). The characteristic signal broadening of the protons on ST was observed because of the shielding effects of the aromatic host (Li et al., 2010).\nFurthermore, protons on WP6 revealed minor chemical shifts resulting from host -guest interactions between WP6 and ST.\nThe formation of host -guest complex between WP6 and ST was further con /uniFB01 rmed through UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. ( Figure 2 ). A broad absorption band above 555 nm, corresponding to the charge-transfer interaction between electron-rich WP6 and electron-de /uniFB01 cient ST, was observed. Furthermore, after adding WP6 to ST, a red shift appeared, which indicated that a representative charge-transfer complex was formed (Wang Y et al., 2014). The /uniFB02 uorescence titration of ST with WP6 was performed under ambient temperature in water. According to. Figure 3A , an enhancement in /uniFB02 uorescence and a red shift in the emission spectra were observed with the progressive supplement of WP6, which indicated that a strong supramolecular complex was formed. These changes may arise from the formation of twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state when ST occupied the WP6 cavity in the aqueous buffer. Under the TICT state, the phenyl or phenazinyl group is assumed to rotate around bonds that connect them to the central single bond. The twisting movement is subjected to restriction of the encapsulated ST guest, leading to enhanced /uniFB02 uorescence (Grabowski et al., 2003; Bojtár, et al., 2015).",

Figure 3B displays the typical process of displacement titration. When caffeine was gradually added into a mixed PBS solution with ST and WP6, /uniFB02 uorescence intensity quenching was apparent. The result proved that the added caffeine was able to rival with ST to push the indicator from the WP6 cavity.

Furthermore, the ' turn-off ' /uniFB02 uorescence changes resulting from caffeine addition could be observed by naked eyes by using a simple UV lamp ( Figure 3B ). The results indicate that the applicability of the ST ⊂ WP6complex to an F-IDA for sensing anticancer drug caffeine.\nThe ST ⊂ WP6 system as a caffeine sensor exhibited higher selectivity than theophylline and theobromine. Theophylline and theobromine at the same concentration (2 mM) were added to the solution of the ST ⊂ WP6 complex, respectively.
