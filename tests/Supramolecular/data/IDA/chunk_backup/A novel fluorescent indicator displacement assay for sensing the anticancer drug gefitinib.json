        "content": "Fluorescent indicator displacement assays have become popular for converting synthetic receptors into optical sensors. We have now shown that a 1:2 host-guest complex between cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) and proflavine (PF) can be used as a fluorescent indicator for sensing the anticancer drug gefitinib. The  2PF@Q[8]  complex  can  be  used  to  detect  gefitinib  with  high  selectivity  using  fluorescence spectrometry with a detection limit of 6.63 × 10 -8  mol -L . The proposed sensing mechanism was investigated  using 1 H  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy  ( 1 H  NMR),  isothermal  titration calorimetry and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. The 2PF@Q[8] complex was shown to be suitable for imaging gefitinib in prostate cancer (PC3) cells, which may help to elucidate relevant biological processes at the molecular level. We have developed a novel F-IDA to detect the anticancer drug GEF with high selectivity. The new indicator has excellent selectivity and a low detection limit for GEF. We have also demonstrated that the F-IDA can be used for the practical determination of drugs in living cells.",

        "content": "In  the  field  of  supramolecular  chemistry,  indicator  displacement assays (IDAs) have gained popularity for converting synthetic receptors into optical sensors. IDAs which utilise  non-covalent  interactions  between  the  indicator or analyte and the host, have been used to sense different analytes, including metal cations and anions, drugs and other biological molecules. In fluorescent IDA assays (F-IDAs), the analyte competes with an indicator for the same binding site on the receptor. When the analyte is added  to  the  indicator-receptor  pair,  the  indicator  is released from the receptor, inducing an absorbance and/\nor fluorescence change ( 1, 2 ). Cucurbit[ n ]urils (Q[ n ]s) are synthetic receptors that are composed of glycoluril units linked through methylene bridges. These receptors have highly polar carbonyl portals with hydrophobic cavities and can form remarkably stable complexes with a variety of guest molecules ( 3, 4 ). F-IDAs using Q[ n ]s which employ host-guest interactions between the indicator ( 5, 6 ) (e.g. an isoquinoline alkaloid or other dye) or analyte and the receptor Q[ n ]s, have been used extensively for sensing or determining non-fluorescent or weakly fluorescent analytes, including ethambutol, sotalol, ranitidine and paraquat ( 7 -13 ). This method, which converts Q[ n ]-indicator\nreceived 4 march 2016 accepted 12 June 2016",

(colour online) Structures of Q[8], proflavine and gefitinib.\ncomplexes  into  optical  sensors,  has  recently  attracted widespread attention because of its simplicity, rapidity, sensitivity and selectivity.\nGefitinib (Iressa , GEF) is an anticancer drug that is used ® in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic nonsmall-cell  lung  cancer  in  patients  who  have  previously received  chemotherapy  ( 14 ).  To  date,  determination  of GEF  has  mainly  used  high-performance  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC),  liquid  chromatography-tandem  mass spectrometry  (HPLC/MS/MS),  high-performance  liquid chromatography  with  ultraviolet  detection  (HPLC-UV) and high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) methods ( 15 -19 ).  Because of their high sensitivity, these methods can be adapted to measure drug concentrations in biological media. GEF exhibits no fluorescence in aqueous solution, which makes its determination difficult using direct fluorescence measurement methods. There are numerous reports describing the formation of host-guest complexes between Q[ n ]s and tricyclic basic dyes which are accommodated inside the Q[ n ] forming supramolecular entities ( 20, 21 ). Proflavine (PF) is a tricyclic basic dye that forms a 1:2 host-guest complex with cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) leading to a decrease in fluorescence intensity of PF ( 22, 23 ).  The fluorescence intensity of PF was quenched when Q[8] was added to a solution of PF and recovered when GEF was added to the Q[8]-PF mixture. Our experimental results show that complexation of Q[8] and PF with GEF provides a fluorescent indicator that has potential application in drug determination. We have developed an F-IDA by converting Q[8]-dye complexes into optical sensors that are able to recognise GEF. We then evaluated the ability of our newly developed method to sense GEF in cell imaging experiments (Figure 1).",
