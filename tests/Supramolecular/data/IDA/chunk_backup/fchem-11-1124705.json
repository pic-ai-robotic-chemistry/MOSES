        "content": "Indicator displacement assays (IDAs) (Metzger and Anslyn, 1998; Wiskur et al., 2001; Nguyen and Anslyn, 2006) have been a favored approach for achieving synthetic-receptor conversion into optical sensors in the supramolecular chemistry realm. IDAs, which exploit the non-covalent interplays of the host with analyte/indicator, have been applied to the sensing of diverse analytes (e.g., metal anions, cations, pharmaceuticals, and other biological molecules) (Rather and Ali, 2021; Sedgwick et al., 2021). IDAs are recognized as a crucial and practical strategy, especially in /uniFB02 uorescence-sensing applications. As the initial step of this approach, an inclusion complex is created between an appropriate indicator dye and an adequate macrocyclic host. In this way, arbitrary (mostly photophysical) traits of the dye molecules are either attenuated or enhanced. Upon application of this inclusion complex for the analyte detection in the solution, the dye s modulated traits are reversed since the dye is displaced from the host ' cavity through competitive analyte -host binding (Bakirci and Nau, 2006; Nguyen and Anslyn, 2006; Praetorius et al., 2008; Dsouza et al., 2011; Jadhav et al., 2015; Norouzy et al., 2015; Sayed et al., 2016; Sayed and Pal, 2016). The utilization of /uniFB02 uorescent dyes in such IDAs is often regarded as profoundly useful in view of the appreciable system response to the analytes under these scenarios via either /uniFB02 uorescence ' turn-off ' or ' turn-on ' sequences (see Figure 1). This approach is de /uniFB01 ned uniquely as Fluorescent-IDAs (F-IDAs).",

The CB n , consisting of n -glycoluril units that are bridged by 2 n -methylene groups, in particular, hold immense negative charge density in the carbonyl rim portals, allowing neutral and cationic organic guests to be bound. At the same time, the interior cavities of CB n are hydrophobic and preferably accommodate hydrophobic\nmoieties (Isaacs, 2014). As the /uniFB02 uorescent guests ' photophysical traits are alterable by the CB n hosts (Dsouza et al., 2011), the application of CB n for host -guest complex creation has been reported, and these complexes have gained further utilization for sensing or determining non/uniFB02 uorescent or weakly /uniFB02 uorescent organic compounds (analytes) via F-IDAs (Ghale and Nau, 2014).\nPQ is resent, there is a displacement of probe MB from the MB2 ⊂ CB8 complex, as the competitive binding interaction of PQ with the CB8 host is more powerful. In response to the existence of PQ, MB is discharged, resulting in an immensely-enhanced /uniFB02 uorescence.\nIn our current mini-review, we detail recent advances in the application of a variety of CB n analytically applied to achieve the /uniFB02 uorescence intensity quenching or enhancement for various guest molecules and the design of F-IDAs induced by CB n based on the quenching or enhancement of /uniFB02 uorescence signals for the analyte assessment purpose.

Upon incorporation of GEF into the CB8 -PF mixture, the /uniFB02 uorescence intensity recovered as the PF was displaced by the GEF. The proposed F-IDA has demonstrated encouraging results in actual applications in determining GEF in living cells using an appropriate imaging technique. In 2018, Hirani et al.

CB7 was used to interact with DAP as a /uniFB02 uorescent guest. DAP exhibited a 200-fold enhancement in its /uniFB02 uorescence intensity after binding to CB7, as well as a turn-off of signal following ammonium product-induced displacement. Given the stronger af /uniFB01 nity of CB7 for cationic alkylammonium products than amino acids, the amino acid incorporation failed to interfere with the F-IDA. In another study, a labelfree F-IDA strategy was designed by Nau and co-workers to achieve realtime continuous protease activity surveillance on unlabeled peptides, where CB7 and AO were utilized as the macrocyclic host and /uniFB02 uorescent guest, respectively (Ghale et al., 2011). CB7 was responsible for selectively identifying the cleavage products, which bear an N-terminal phenylalanine residue. AO was responsible for the reaction signaling after being selectively displaced from CB7 by the high-af /uniFB01 nity proteolysis product. An established inhibitor phosphoramidon was adopted to verify the protease inhibition quantifying the capacity of the proposed F-IDA strategy. Wang et al.

Powerful binding of ABAM to the CB7 was noted, and ABAM CB7, a ⊂ /uniFB02 uorescent host -guest mixture, was formed, which sequentially exhibited strong interference resistance and enabled highly selective AMA recognition.
