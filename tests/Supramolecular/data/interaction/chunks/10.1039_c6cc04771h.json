In addition to reporting their discovery, his initial communication and full paper\nDepartment of Chemistry, University of Victoria, Victoria, V8W3V6 Canada. E-mail: fhof@uvic.ca thoroughly described the ion-dipole interactions, complementary sizes and shapes of host and guest, electronic effects, and solvation effects that drive selective complexation in dozens of crown ether hosts. 1,2 The intervening decades gave rise to many more lessons learned from host-guest systems. Every fundamental kind of weak interaction that governs molecular recognition has been proven, probed, explored, and expanded using host-guest chemistry.\nFraser Hof\nFraser Hof was born in 1976, raised in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada. He earned his BSc at the University of Alberta, carrying out research with David Bundle, Derrick Clive, and Neil Branda. In 1998 he moved to the Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, to study supramolecular chemistry with Julius Rebek, Jr. After obtaining his PhD at Scripps, he was a Novartis Foundation (2003) and Human Frontier Science Program (2004) post- doctoral fellow studying medicinal chemistry with Fran√ßois Diederich at ETH. He took up his position at the University of Victoria in 2005, where he is currently Professor and Canada Research Chair in Supramolecular and Medicinal Chemistry. His research interests involve supramolecular chemistry, medicinal chemistry, assay development, and proteomics studies related to epigenetic methylation pathways.\nSupramolecular chemistry was linked to biology shortly after its first invention, and the connection to the life sciences has remained strong. Both are sciences dominated by weak interactions and molecular recognition. All varieties of weak interactions, except those that involve unnatural functional groups, are encoded and used by natural molecules themselves. Biomolecules have always been common as 'guests' in host-guest chemistry. One could argue that even Na + (one target of Pedersen's original host-guest chemistry) is a guest that is important to biology. But as host-guest chemistry has developed, we have increasingly thought of making hosts to target proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and complex metabolites.",

But there are also applied reasons for doing host-guest chemistry. The term technoscience-the pursuit of new, useful tools, while also pushing for new fundamental knowledge-is an apt description for much of the research that occurs in the area of host-guest chemistry. Ours is one of many research programs that operate under a common premise: that host-guest chemistry can solve critical problems in the applied biosciences. One such set of problems involves the recognition and binding of methylated\nO\np\namino acids, peptides, and proteins. This set of targets is important-their rich functional biology has been the subject of multiple volumes. Of particular note for this article, methylated peptide and protein targets are particularly hard to address with antibody-based affinity reagents. 3-6\nThis Feature Article will review our work on creating supramolecular hosts for binding methylated targets, and will also offer a personal perspective on related science by other groups. The main biological motivations for our research program will be summarized. Both fundamental and applied lessons in molecular recognition will be discussed, along with the evolution of the host systems that we have created. We are not dogmatic about the use of calixarenes (as opposed to other macrocycles or other host families), but they have proven particularly useful for our targets and feature prominently in our research program. We will offer some examples that show how fundamental host-guest chemistry can lead to the creation of much-needed research reagents. We hope also to offer generally useful insight into the strategies and future prospects for host-guest chemistry on biological targets.",

        "content": "''What's going on?'' - Marvin Gaye\nThe programmed addition of groups on to protein side chains is called post-translational modification. Such groups (collectively called PTMs) are diverse in chemical structure. Many interesting chemical questions arise when one considers what kinds of groups go on to proteins, what their roles are in the cell, and how they do their jobs at a molecular level.\nThere are 4 100 known PTMs, 7 but from a chemical point of view PTMs can be put into three broad classes: those that involve changes of side-chain functional groups ( e.g. phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation), those that involve the grafting of large recognition modules onto side chains ( e.g. ubiquitylation, SUMOylation, and many forms of glycosylation), and those modifications that involve conformational switching ( e.g. proline cis -trans isomerization).\nMany forms of biological control circuits have evolved (Fig. 1). The control of cellular processes occurs first at the level of the gene.\nFig. 1 Paradigms for cellular control over protein-mediated processes. The DNA, mRNA, and protein form of histone 3 illustrate the general concepts. Structures generated using make-na (DNA, RNA) and pdb code 1KX5 (protein).\nV\nGenetic sequences offer coded instructions: mutations can change the nature of the translated product, and multiple pathways that regulate the amount of mRNA present for a given gene control its protein expression levels. PTMs offer additional control over the functions of translated proteins, and are ubiquitous in all kingdoms of life. The manually annotated SwissProt database lists 4 28000 phosphorylation sites, 4 4900 acetylation sites, 4 2500 glycosylation sites, and 4 400 methylation sites in the human proteome. 8 Other databases report much higher numbers. 9 Regardless of the exact numbers, the numbers of PTM-labeled sites listed in various databases are greater than the number of discrete translated proteins that are thought to exist in any given human tissue. Evolution is complicated, but we can speculate that in many cases PTM pathways have evolved either because of a need for on/off functional switches that can respond more quickly than transcription-translation controls, or because a PTM offers functions that are impossible to achieve with the 20 canonical amino acids.",

        "content": "Our work in the area focuses exclusively on PTMs that are relatively small functional groups (Fig. 2), and our initial curiosity was how relatively small chemical groups can cause dramatic changes in the cell. Protein phosphorylation is one such example, and it is often the first post-translational modification encountered by a chemistry or biochemistry student. The most common examples involve transfer of a phosphate group onto the alcohol side chains of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues. Installation and removal is done by kinases and phosphatases with some degree of specificity for their targeted proteins and residues. Phosphorylation installs an anionic group onto a neutral side chain. It confers the ability to coordinate metal ions and to form salt bridges. Some proteins change their folded state upon phosphorylation, some become targets for binding and regulation by other phospho-recognizing proteins, and some have interactions with regulatory partners blocked upon phosphorylation. In all cases, the introduction of a formal charge is central to the functions of phosphorylation. Lysine acetylation and arginine citrullination are similar, in that in each case a formally cationic side chain is rendered neutral by the chemical modification.\nMethylation is different than these other PTMs in some intriguing ways.\nThe term methylation in this context actually refers to multiple functionally different modifications. Lysine and arginine are the most commonly methylated residues, but even restricting the discussion only to these two side chains produces a long list of 'methyl' modifications. Lysine can be methylated 1-3 times. Arginine can be mono- or dimethylated, and two isomeric forms of dimethylarginine exist.\nIn biology, every methyl matters. Dimethyllysine can signal a different functional outcome than trimethyllysine. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (aDMA) and its isomeric PTM, symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA), are installed by different enzymes, and one can produce a biological effect completely opposite to the effect of the other. The enzymes that install methylation marks are highly specific for a given target protein, a given residue number within that target protein, and the number of\nO\np",

Examples exist in which an enzyme mutant that is poor at creating dimethyllysine, but is hyperactive for converting dimethyllysine to trimethyllysine, causes critical changes in tumor biology and patient survival. Demethylases have similarly high specificities for the sites and degrees of methylation that are their substrates and products.\nMethylation is also unique among PTMs from a physicochemical point of view. It is the physically smallest group that can be added to a biomolecule. It also leaves cationic lysine or arginine residues in their native, positive states, with only small perturbations in p K a. 10 This holds true for all degrees of methylation at any given residue.\nHow can we reconcile the subtlety of methylation events with the major biological changes ascribed to them? Because we don't expect large protein folding changes to result from, for example, the change from dimethyllysine to trimethyllysine, the differences in outcome must arise mainly from proteins that can recognize and distinguish between these PTMs. PTM-binding proteins are collectively called reader proteins, because of their ability to read out the code of different modifications. 11 Methyl reader proteins are a subset of these that offer a master class in molecular recognition.\nMethyl reader domains exist in at least seven distinct protein families. 12 Some have shallower, surface-exposed binding sites, and others use deep pockets to engage the methylated side chain. 13 All handle the recognition of neighbouring residues in different, mostly unremarkable ways . . . those that require high sequence and site specificity have more contacts with neighbouring side chains, and those that require lower sequence specificity have fewer peripheral contacts. 14 But all methyllysine readers have evolved a common kind of binding pocket, the aromatic cage, that is the home to some particularly interesting molecular recognition.",

Oh but how, Do they make contact with one another?'' - Rush\nThe physical organic chemistry lessons on display in methyl reader proteins were the reason for our entry into this field. It started as a challenge . . . could supramolecular hosts be made that achieve protein-like affinity and selectivity for posttranslational methylation sites? What could we learn from them? Could they serve as the basis for new methyl-targeting reagents useful for research in chemical biology?\nSupramolecular hosts that would bind post-translationally methylated targets face some challenges:\nV\n-the ability to function in biologically relevant solvent (warm, salty water)\n- the need to bind weakly to unmethylated parent amino acids in spite of their similar charge states\n- the ability to bind strongly enough to out-compete native reader proteins\n- the ability to function on amino acids, peptides, and/or whole proteins\n- the need to discriminate among the different methylation states\nOur first efforts to make synthetic hosts for post-translational methylation started with tryptophan-a building block that is both an electron-rich cation-pi donor, and a hydrophobic binding surface for alkyl ammonium ions. We proposed that the addition of an extended aromatic surface onto tryptophan itself, as in N -benzyl tryptophan, would provide a modular amino acid building block that could be incorporated into various host structures. Simple dipeptide hosts 1-3 were made, and tested for binding to guests with RNMe3 + groups similar to that of trimethyllysine (Fig. 4). 21 Binding in buffered water was measurable, but very weak (Table 1). The increase of binding affinity in going from 1-3 , along with NMR chemical shift perturbations, suggested that the binding was occurring through contacts between N -benzyl tryptophan and the cationic RNMe3 + element as predicted by molecular models (Fig. 4b), but we were unable to identify scaffolds within which this N -benzyl tryptophan binding element would offer useful guest binding.",

The short peptide R-Kme3-S-T, which represents a common lysine methylation site on histone 3, was used as a guest in NMR and ITC experiments. 32 Addition of 1 equivalent of 8 caused upfield shifts mainly on the N -CH3 and e -CH2 resonances. Similar shifts occurred for the free amino acids, proving that the structure of the complex in each case involves the quaternary RNMe3 + groups buried in the shielding environment of the host's binding pocket (Fig. 5). The affinity of the host for the peptide is even higher than its affinity for the free amino acid. It seems that the host's sulfonates can make additional favorable contacts with the neighboring polar side chains in the peptide. The backbone elements of the free amino acid Kme3 are strongly hydrated and zwitterionic, and therefore offer less in the way of electrostatic and/or hydrophobic driving force for host-guest binding.

Together with Irina Paci, we found through computation, NMR, and crystallography that 8 chooses a single Kme2 residue (K116me2) on the surface of the globally dimethylated lysozyme construct (Fig. 7). 43 Selectivity in the context of a folded protein arises from varying degrees of side chain accessibility, as well as different peripheral contacts\nFig. 7 Compound 8 binds selectively to one Kme2 residue on the surface of a folded protein.

While calixarenes are almost always lower-affinity reagents than, say, cucurbiturils, they are easier to modify than many other compound classes. And synthesis is one of the central powers that sets chemistry apart from purely observational sciences. Many students who choose chemistry as a career do so because they enjoy creation of new matter (tinkering) more than they enjoy the pure observation of nature (birdwatching).\nCalixarenes are fully addressable by installation of different groups at lower- and upper-rim positions. In host-guest applications where the concave aromatic pocket is the primary binding surface, lower-rim modifications have strong effects through changing the conformation of the binding pocket. Upper-rim modifications directly change the shape and functionality of the binding surface-a feat that is not easily achieved for hosts like cucurbiturils, where all bond vectors are directed out and away from the guest. The chemistry used to modify calixarene upper-rim positions with high degrees of selectivity often uses elegant reactions that use the proximity of adjacent rings in 3-dimensional space to provide specificity that is impossible on a typical, flat organic molecule. 45-48\nUpper-rim modifications were key to tuning the affinity for trimethyllysine. Gutsche's method was used to differentiate a single upper-rim position, by high-yielding and selective installation of de-activating ester groups at three of the four lower-rim hydroxyls. 49 Subsequent nitration 50 or bromination 51 by the methods of Nam and Harvey provides key, monofunctionalized intermediates 12 and 13 that we used to prepare a series of trisulfonate calix[4]arenes each presenting a different functional binding element on the fourth upper-rim position (Fig. 8). 52",

Many biologically inspired recognition modules (including others that we've made) tend to operate in organic-aqueous solvent mixtures, before falling apart in pure water. Some that operate in pure water fall apart upon addition of biologically relevant levels of salt. Unlike all of our earlier efforts at programming recognition in polar media, we found by isothermal titration calorimetry that these dimers become stronger in high salt conditions. We could rationalize this result as being an outcome of using hydrophobic attraction tempered by mutual electrostatic repulsion-upon addition of salt, the reduced mutual repulsion between the highly charged monomers like tetra-anionic 26 leads to an overall stronger binding event.",

Each dimerizing molecule responds to added salt by forming a stronger overall dimer, while doing something that looks like an unusual form of enthalpy-entropy compensation: the enthalpy gets less favourable, while the entropy gets more favorable by a greater extent ( e.g. for 26 D H = /C0 10.3 kcal mol /C0 1 , and T D S = /C0 5.9 kcal mol /C0 1 ).

We were interested in identifying agents with selectivity for H3K4me3 over H3K9me3. These two methylation marks are located close to each other on the tail of histone 3, but produce opposite biological functions. H3K4me3 is associated with transcriptional activation, and recruits methyl reader proteins to chromatin in order to carry out this program. H3K9me3 drives transcriptional repression, and does so by recruiting a distinct set of silencing reader proteins.\nWe identified a small set of calixarenes that could bind an H3K4me3 peptide with small preference over an H3K9me3 peptide. We first discovered good candidates from a small screen using a fluorescence indicator displacement assay. 67 Our collaborators in the group of Tatiana Kutateladze used fluorescence polarization, protein NMR, and pulldown experiments to show that these agents were able to disrupt the complex of H3K4me3 with multiple of its native reader proteins, including the PHD domain of the protein Mixed Lineage Leukemia-5 (MLL5). 67\nSulfonated calixarenes look like terrible candidates for cellbased studies.

In fact, they fail on almost every structural predictor of drug-likeness except in having a low number of rotatable bonds. 69 And yet some of these compounds defy low expectations-there are a handful of reports of calixarenes and resorcinarenes being able to enter and engage their targets inside of cells and/or liposomes. 29,56,70-74",

An additional finding of interest in this work is that the presence of 8 improves the uptake of lucigenin into cells in the first place. 70 This result is reminiscent of the use of 8 to drive dye uptake and transport across a layer of epithelial cells, 76 and also of the use of 8 to rescue experimental animals from poisoning with methyl viologen. 77,78 The collective lesson of these and other studies with diverse supramolecular hosts is that low perceived drug-likeness is a poor reason not to try innovative host-guest chemistry in living systems.",

These challenges have almost exclusively been tackled using antibodies and related, engineered proteins, that have been selected for their high specificity for a given modification.\nWe took up this challenge using a chemical sensor array driven by host-guest chemistry. This chemical sensor array approach does not require specific lock-and-key molecular recognition. Instead, it uses a set of relatively promiscuous sensor elements that each must only provide a different pattern of responses to a given analyte. This makes the whole sensor array approach very well suited to being deployed in host-guest settings. Different aspects of this approach have been thoroughly reviewed. 79,80\nBased on the above results, sulfonato calixarenes were an obvious set of receptors to use, when trying to discriminate posttranslationally methylated analytes. A set of promiscuous sensors is required for pattern-based sensing. We used indicator displacement assays based on Shinkai's work with 28 81 and Nau's work with lucigenin 75 (previously discussed). Each dye was partnered with a small set of hosts that were expected to be more-or-less promiscuous for this set of targets: 8 , the desymmetrized synthetic analog 29 , and p -sulfonatocalix[6]arene 30 (Fig. 13). 82\nThis simple three-element sensor array proved to be capable of multiple kinds of discrimination. 82 In each case, the sensor array was trained on a set of known post-translationally modified peptide analytes. The intensity of fluorescence generated upon release of lucigenin from each host was quantified, and the threevalue pattern was processed by known chemometric analyses in\nFig. 13 (a) Schematic representation of a chemical sensor array based on indicator displacement. (b) Sensor array components: calixarenes 8 , 29 , and 30 were combined with either lucigenin or dye 28 to create threeelement sensor arrays for analysis of post-translationally modified amino acids and peptides.\nV",

Many assays for these enzymes exist. But the vast majority of them rely on developing signal using antibody- or radioisotope-driven detection schemes, and therefore can't report on reaction progress in real time.\nWe showed using our sensor array that a mocked up set of unmethylated and methylated analytes that represented the substrate and product of various enzymes. The idea and the power of this approach was to monitor either methyl transferase or demethylase reactions, while being able to discriminate in each case between multiple different products that could be formed by a given enzyme. Jeltsch and Nau showed that 8 -lucigenin could report on methylation of H3K9 by the methyl transferase, Dim5, in real time. 83 Our sensor array would potentially provide richer information, in that conversion to either H3K4me3 or H3K9me3 (or, for that matter, partial methylation to the mono- or dimethyllysine products) would generate distinct outputs. In proof-ofconcept work, the array was able to analyze reproducibly the 'reaction progress' toward each possible product in mock samples. 82 We anticipate that the combination of Nau's real-time analysis and our sensor array approach will create a continuous assay that is more information-rich than any currently available type of assay in the field of post-translational modification enzymes.",

One of my professors said to me during a 4th year BSc oral exam that, '' Supramolecular chemists always want to make something as specific as an enzyme . . . but by the time you've added all of the complex functionality to the host that is needed to get there . . . you might as well have made an enzyme instead .'' This is one perspective on the fact that supramolecular hosts, by nature, have smaller interaction surface areas than do their naturally evolved protein counterparts. 20 years after this comment was made, we must admit that although we have in-depth knowledge of every kind of weak interaction, we remain unable to create by de novo design a supramolecular host that is perfectly selective for a single biological target.\nWhile it is true that perfect specificity is hard, one can conceive of many forms of selectivity that are possible. Several examples are on display in the results discussed above. Other schemes like the chemical sensor arrays work by intentionally giving up on achieving perfect specificity, and instead taking advantage of selectivity patterns in order to do useful analysis.\nV",

(b) Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) is an example of a pan-specific method for enriching all phosphorylated peptides.\nThe field of PTMs brings another kind of specificity to the discussion. ''Pan-specific'' reagents are those that can bind a given kind of modification (and not other modification types), regardless of its surrounding peptide sequence (Fig. 15a). Such reagents are critical for prospecting of post-translationally modified analytes, where all analytes marked with a given modification are the targets for binding and enrichment. Pan-specific reagents for phosphorylated peptides are the archetypal examples. 81 In a typical protocol, biological samples are proteolyzed, and the resulting mix of thousands of peptides is run over a TiO2 or immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC, Fig. 15b) column, which trap all phosphopeptides through strong phosphate-metal coordination. Subsequent analysis of the enriched samples allows observation of phosphopeptides that would not otherwise be detectable. Such pan-specific reagents are central to phosphoproteomics, and are used every day in hundreds of labs. Pan-specific reagents for other PTMs like citrullination have also been developed. 20,21\nThe physicochemical properties of methyllysines, described earlier, make them especially challenging targets for selective enrichment. The pan-specific reagents that have been developed for methyllysines are exclusively antibody- or protein-based. Most are polyclonal antibodies that suffer from poor performance and significant batch variability bad enough that it has spawned a series of scholarly articles that examine just how bad the performance of PTM antibodies can be. 4,6,84,85 Making and testing more antibodies will probably overcome these limitations, but it remains true that antibodyand protein-based binding interfaces are intrinsically not well suited to the problem of pan-specific PTM enrichment. They have large contact surface areas, and only a small portion of the binding surfaces can contact the key methyl groups that define the closely related analytes from each other.\nO\np",

Downloaded on 05/07/2016 02:11:43.\nWhen the specific application requires pan-specificity, we propose that supramolecular hosts have inherent advantages over biomolecular affinity agents. Their small binding surface are well suited to binding individual functional groups while ignoring surrounding structures on the targeted analyte. In addition, they can be synthesized and purified to homogeneity, avoiding the liabilities associated with batch reproducibility in bio-reagents.\nWe proved this concept using a calixarene-based affinity reagents for trimethyllysine. 86 The PTM-binding abilities of a small set of hosts were determined in solution-based fluorescence indicator displacement experiments. An agent ( 18 ) with good affinity for multiple Kme3-containing peptides was chosen, and coupled to an agarose solid support to create 18-aga (Fig. 16a). This solid phase showed small selectivity for Kme3-containing peptides in pulldown experiments, which was amplified into excellent performance when the same solid phase was packed into a column and used for affinity chromatography.\nColumns packed with 18-aga retain Kme3-containing peptides much more strongly than identical peptides with an unmodified lysine residue (Fig. 16b). It operates via a strong cation-exchange mechanism (thanks to its multiple sulfonates), and requires very strong salt conditions (gradients running up to 4 2 M NH4Cl) in order to achieve elution. We showed separately that a traditional sulfonate-based strong cation-exchange column can't achieve any separation of methylated and unmethylated peptides, because they each bear the same net charge. We conclude that the column 18-aga retains analytes by a mixture of ion exchange and hostguest mechanisms, which are broken up as salt concentrations increase.\nThe pan-specificity of 18-aga makes it useful for PTM enrichment and prospecting.

It also revealed some trimethyllysine sites on nuclear proteins that had never been identified in any data set, whether collected with or without antibody enrichment.

This has important effects on how we practice supramolecular chemistry. Reductionist labels for weak interactions are needed to discuss them in a simple way. In practice, the combination of those interactions can sometimes provide results that are programmable and understandable on an atom-by-atom basis. But properties often emerge that can't be accounted for by simple addition of non-covalent contacts. The success of reductionist thinking, and atom-by-atom designs, seems to be particularly poor for host-guest systems in salty aqueous solutions, where entropy effects become relatively large and unpredictable. Reductionist labels and atom-by-atom designs are unable to provide answers to our most interesting problems in biomolecular recognition.\nThe supramolecular hosts described in this article are inspired by nature, and aimed at natural targets. But a relatively small, rigid, and simple macrocyclic host will never encode the subtle combinations of structure, dynamics, and solvation that proteins have evolved naturally. Because of this, the pursuit of antibodylike specificity using a synthetic host molecule is an uphill battle. Better, then, to take aim at targets and applications that don't require ultimate specificity, and that are better suited to the inherent properties of supramolecular hosts. One such example is found in the creation of pan-specific reagents, but other applications also exist that rely on selectivity, and not specificity, in a way that plays to the natural strengths of supramolecular hosts.\nIt is not necessary to give up on fundamental discoveries while doing applied science. Biological targets set up many difficult challenges. Some of those challenges arise from their complex structures. Others arise simply from the wide array of salts and co-solutes that exist in biological solutions. All of those challenges make this a very rewarding area for basic discovery.\nIt is important to consider the field of bio-supramolecular chemistry within the broader context of emerging automation, increasing computational power, big data, artificial intelligence, and the promise of all of these things to solve intractable\nO\np\nen Access Article.

And, like some other 'wet sciences', the practice of organic synthesis and purification has so far resisted efforts at end-to-end automation except in very limited circumstances.
