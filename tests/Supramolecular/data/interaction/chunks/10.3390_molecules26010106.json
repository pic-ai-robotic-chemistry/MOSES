This problematic is prevalent for the recognition of peptides, which not only have key roles in many biochemical pathways, as well as having pharmacological and biotechnological applications, but also frequently serve as models for the study of proteins. Taking inspiration in nature and on the interactions that occur between several receptors and peptide sequences, many researchers have developed and applied a variety of different synthetic receptors, as is the case of macrocyclic compounds, molecular imprinted polymers, organometallic cages, among others, to bind amino acids, small peptides and proteins. In this critical review, we present and discuss selected examples of synthetic receptors for amino acids and peptides, with a greater focus on supramolecular receptors, which show great promise for the selective recognition of these biomolecules in physiological conditions. We decided to focus preferentially on small synthetic receptors (leaving out of this review high molecular weight polymeric systems) for which more detailed and accurate molecular level information regarding the main structural and thermodynamic features of the receptor biomolecule assemblies is available.\nKeywords: amino acids; peptides; host-guest systems; molecular recognition; supramolecular receptors",

Therefore, it is necessary to explore other mechanisms, such as the hydrophobic effect and multiple interactions acting cooperatively to achieve the high affinity required to bind the peptide targets at relevant µ Mconcentration or below [11]. In addition, the flexible, rather ill-defined structure of peptide sequences also increases the difficulties associated with the rational design of small receptors [6,12-14]. While the challenges associated to the factors enumerated above may be common to other biological targets, peptide recognition, in its completeness, requires receptors that are sequence-selective, discriminating not only the type of amino acids residues composing the peptide but also the order by which the they are arranged.\nAlthough general methods for high affinity peptide recognition by synthetic receptors are still missing, several research groups have reported encouraging results that show that it is possible to bind specific peptide sequences with simple receptors, such as macrocyclic cavitands, molecular clips, and tweezers or self-assembled coordination cages. Other strategies based on templating methods, such as molecular imprinted polymers and micelles, also showed very promising results. In this review we will cover selected examples of cavitand-based receptors that have been shown to recognize amino acids and peptides in aqueous solution and use these examples to emphasize the noncovalent interactions and geometric factors that control binding stability and selectivity of the different complexes. For this reason, we focus on small molecule receptors for which this type of information can be extrapolated in a more straightforward way and potentially used for the rational optimization of current receptors and design of new ones. Then we will also provide some selected examples of biological and technological applications based on the binding properties of the receptors discussed here to illustrate the potential of these molecules and approaches.",

Even though they are important targets by themselves, the development of supramolecular receptors that can bind specific amino acids with high affinity and selectivity constitutes a first step towards the development of multivalent, sequence specific receptors for peptides. However, the selective binding of free amino acids already presents a difficult task since some side chains of amino acids are very similar to each other. In this section we have divided the 20 common amino acids into four categories: basic, aromatic, acid, and neutral nonaromatic amino acids and discussed their properties. In the next section, their recognition by selected supramolecular receptors will be further discussed.",

Arginine has a very important role in the membrane penetrating properties of antimicrobial peptides, as well [20].\nThe positive charges on these two amino acids make them easier targets for the development of receptors in water, many of them relying on the formation of several ionic interactions to obtain the receptor-analyte complexes. This is the case of p -sulfonatocalix[n] arene [21-23], some examples of molecular tweezers [24,25], carboxylatopillar [5]arene [26], all of which have negative charges, to form ionic bonds with the charged amines of Lys and Arg.\nL-Histidine (His), despite the presence of two nitrogen atoms, is near equilibrium between its deprotonated and protonated form, at physiological pH, due to its p K a of 6.5 [27]. Due to this, it can act as a proton donor or acceptor, depending on the environment near the residue [27]. Despite this property, histidine is usually paired with the other two\nbasic amino acids. Regardless, it presents a lower charge density than the other two and thus His is difficult to target selectively by ionic interactions, in favor of Lys and Arg [26,28].",

Moreover, these amino acids are precursors of several neurotransmitters-dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, etc. [32]. Besides these functions, tryptophan also has a role in the ability of antimicrobial peptides to form pores on membranes, through the formation of cationπ bonds with arginine [33].\nIn terms of protein detection and analytical studies, aromatic amino acids are important because they give proteins the characteristic 280 nm absorption band and are the only amino acids that present fluorescence, specially tryptophan, with a higher quantum yield than the other aromatic amino acids [34]. Many strategies for the recognition of these amino acids are based on hydrophobic, π π -and ion dipole interactions, making use not only of the aromatic group's characteristic properties but also of the bigger size of these amino acids' side chain [35-45].",

Glutamate is well known for its role as excitatory neurotransmitter in vertebrates, as well as precursor for gamma-Aminobutyric acid, GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter [46]. This amino acid is also the precursor to several other biomolecules and takes part in the process of elimination of ammonium, in the urea cycle [47]. Like glutamate, aspartate is also an important precursor in several biosynthetic pathways and takes part in the urea cycle [48]. However, this anionic amino acid is also essential in energetical processes in eukaryotic cells, being part of the malateaspartate shuttle [49] and also having a role in the gluconeogenesis pathway [50].\nUnlike cationic and aromatic amino acids, none of the most used macrocycles or supramolecular systems show particular affinity towards these two amino acids, without the need for further functionalization. Nevertheless, the functionalization of macrocyclic compounds with cationic groups has been demonstrated to yield potential receptors for these amino acids [51-53].",

However, these amino acids still have key roles in proteins and peptides, providing sites for glycosylation [55,56] and other post translational modifications [7]. They are also fundamental in ammonia regulation [57], anabolic and catabolic processes in eukaryotic cells (acting as precursors to other macronutrients or sources of energy) [50] and redox homeostasis [58].\nDespite the difficulty of targeting these molecules, some receptors were developed for several of these amino acids. Many of these, however, only reach mM affinities and many were not tested in physiological conditions due to low solubilities in water [54]. Furthermore, many receptors that bind to these biomolecules with higher affinity present very low selectivity and are frequently able to bind to other amino acids with similar or even higher affinities [35,41,43,59].\nThiols are particularly reactive and so, the recognition and detection of L-Cysteine is more commonly based on the creation of sensors that react with this redox biomolecule by nucleophilic substitution [60].

Amongst the different aromatic amino acids, CB7 is selective for Phe by a factor of approximately 10 over Tyr and by a factor of 100 over Trp [102]. Most thermodynamic studies show that the complexation process is enthalpy driven in great part due to the displacement of high energy water molecules from the cavity of the host [102,105-108]. This hydrophobic effect can be complemented by attractive ion-dipole interactions between the protonated amino group of the biomolecules and the carbonyl group of the cucurbituril (Figure 7) [35,44,109].

These constitute a class of receptors that present a 'enforced cavity' where a small guest can bind, being the most widely studied ones those based on resorcinarenes macrocycles [62,112]. The Dalcanale group has reported several cavitand derivatives (Figure 11) that were found to recognize amino acids and amino acid metabolites [113,114], and were able to obtain the crystallographic structure of the complexes between some of these cavitand receptors and all basic amino acids, Arg, Lys, and His. The 1:2 complexes were shown to be mainly stabilized by direct and watermediated hydrogen bonds between a guest molecule and two host molecules [114].

The selective complexation of sarcosine in solution was confirmed by ITC experiments in methanol, by water:chloroform extraction and solubilization assays. The recognition of sarcosine in water and in urine was achieved by grafting the cavitands to a silicon surface. The authors showed that the receptor held its recognition properties at these interfaces and devised a sensor based on a luminescence indicator displacement assay using (9-anthrylmethyl) methyl ammonium chloride as probe.\nMore recently, a comprehensive study on recognition of amino acids by tetraphosphonate cavitands was performed to dissect the thermodynamic factors responsible for the observed selectivity of these receptors towards N -methyl amino acids [115]. The complexation was investigated both in methanol and in aqueous solutions, showing that the stability of the resulting complexes significantly decreases (almost 2 order of magnitude) in water. The ITC results demonstrated that while the association process is both enthalpy and entropy-driven in methanol, it becomes entropically unfavorable in water. The authors attributed this observation to the non-classical enthalpy driven hydrophobic effect and to the enhanced solvation of the complex in aqueous solution. Despite of the decreased affinity, the selectivity of these receptors toward N -methylated amino acids improves in aqueous solution resulting in their exclusive complexation.\nMolecules\n2021\n,\n26\n, 106\nin water.

For small peptides most of their residues are easily available for binding and is also easier to select a target region for detection. In either case, the best way to achieve this is by the recognition of the peptide side-chains or C and N-terminal amino acid residues [7]. In this section, the focus will be on the previously mentioned receptors, and other, more complex structures, applied in the selective recognition of target amino acid sequences in peptides [22,24-26,35,52,121-123].",

Cyclodextrins, for example, have been shown to have affinity for hydrophobic amino acids like phenylalanine, but still bind weakly to the peptides studied in most works, while cucurbit[n]urils, which are selective for hydrophobic and basic amino acids form complexes with peptides and proteins that are significantly more stable, reaching nanomolar affinities in specific cases [37,108,124,125]. Charged macrocyclic receptors, as can be expected, bind oppositely charged residues, being this, together with the hydrophobic effect, the main driving forces for peptide binding in aqueous solutions while other non-covalent interactions may contribute in a small extent for overall binding energy [7,9,33]. However, it must be stressed that these secondary interactions may play a decisive role in the overall selectivity and structure of the complexes.\nThe simplest and non-modified forms of these macrocycles can be used for selective binding of peptides, which is reported in many studies [21,35,41]. Using these as a starting point, many other receptors have been developed, modifying the original structures to suit the type of amino acids and peptides that are being targeted [40,52]. There are also other types of macrocycles that, while less used for biological applications, have been adapted and show promise in the binding and detection of peptides, as was touched upon in the previous chapters [51,94,95].",

One of the first studies with polycationic peptides and SC4 was reported by Morel-Desrosiers and co-workers [22], in which they observe some changes in the way that peptides bind to this receptor, in comparison to the single amino acid. For Lys-Lys, Arg-Arg and Lys-Arg, the N -terminal amino acid is enclosed within the cavity of the receptor, with the C-terminal amino acid staying only near the entrance of the macrocycle. NMR studies showed that, between Lys-Lys and Arg-Arg, the latter binds deeper in the SC4 cavity, most likely due to the stabilization of the complex by cationπ interactions. The two other peptides differ slightly in the mode of binding-while Lys-Arg seems to bind with the N -terminal amino acid, lysine, in the cavity and arginine remaining outside the macrocycle, the Arg-Lys peptide binds with the C-terminal deeper in the cavity.\nThe tripeptides tested in this study showed higher stabilization than the remainder of the analytes. This is most likely due to two main factors: the multivalent ionic interactions, due to the presence of an added cationic group, increasing the sites of interaction and, so, increasing the stability of the complex [126]; a greater distance between the C-terminal and the sulfonate groups of the receptor diminishes the electrostatic repulsion between these two negatively charged groups and allows for more stable binding with the N -terminal amino acid, deeper in the cavity, and the middle amino acid, at the entrance of the cavity.

As previously mentioned, CB[n] generally display higher affinity for hydrophobic aromatic amino acids being the release of high energy water molecules from the macrocycle's cavity the main thermodynamic driving force contributing for the stability of the complexes [105]. Ion-dipole and hydrogen bonding interactions between carbonyls portals of the receptor and specific functional groups present in the peptide are believed to contribute in a less extension for the overall driving force but may have a decisive role in the observed selectivity. The high affinity interactions of N -terminal aromatic residues, in particular phenylalanine, with CB7 and CB8 constitutes a paradigmatic target for the selective binding behavior of this class of hosts [7,37,108,122,124]. For example, Phe-Gly and CB7 form a 1:1 complex with a K = 3.0 × 10 7 M 1 while the complex formed with Gly-Phe is much weaker -( K = 1.3 × 10 3 M 1 ), as is summarized in Table 2 [122]. In both cases the phenylalanine -residue is included in the CB7 cavity. However, while in Phe-Gly this binding mode favors attractive ion-dipole interactions between the carbonyl portals and the ammonium group and minimizes the repulsion of the portal with the carboxylate group, for Gly-Phe the carboxylate is closer to the carbonyl group precluding optimal inclusion by electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, the attractive interaction between the ammonium group in the Gly residue with the carbonyl portals of the receptor imposes a significant entropic penalty due to conformational restriction of the guest [122]. Although displaying slightly lower binding constant, both tryptophan- and tyrosine-glycine dipeptides display similar behavior to that described for Phe-Gly/Gly-Phe [122]. It is also worth noting that the smaller CB6, in contrast to CB7 and CB8 (see below), does not significantly bind peptides with terminal aromatic residues, showing much higher affinity for those comprising terminal lysine [122].",

While the arguments described above -to rationalize the selective binding of N -terminal aromatic residues to CB7 are also likely to hold here, the crystal structures shown in Figure 20, besides showing those interactions, also demonstrate that hydrogen bonding between the amide protons and the oxygen atoms in the carbonyl portals may also contribute to increase the stability of these complexes [108]. 25 of 44\n2021\n,\n26\n, 106\nFigure 20.

With this in mind, Chinai et al. evaluated the affinity of this system towards human insulin and a mutant variety without the N -terminal aromatic amino acid [124]. This latter variant showed an obvious decrease in affinity towards CB7 when compared to human insulin. The latter showed similar affinity towards the macrocycle as Phe-Gly-Gly. Furthermore, it was observable a slight change in conformation in insulin to allow for this binding, exposing the N -terminal to the complexation, but without altering the overall structure of the protein. This implies that even less exposed N -terminal amino acids could be targets for this type of sensing without any major interference with the rest of the structure, while also distinguishing them from other aromatic amino acids in a protein's surface or in a peptide's sequence (Figure 22).

Control over protein assembly and function is another route that is being explored for this supramolecular system [9,141-148].

These compounds offer an (often electron-rich aromatic) pocket-like binding site, which is usually decorated with functional groups that may provide additional sites of interaction and water-solubility [165-167].\nThe most popular molecular tweezers with applications in the recognition of amino acids and peptides are probably those developed by the Klärner group, which bind preferentially basic amino acid lysine and arginine, as mentioned in Section 3.2. [167]. Some of these compounds show a tendency to form self-assembled dimers, a process that may compete with the complexation of selected targets and lead to concentration dependent apparent binding constants [168]. However, anionic tweezers such as the ones shown is Figure 15 (see Section 3.2) are fluorescent, allowing the monitorization of the complexation process and determination of the binding constants at low concentrations [168]. Besides the amino acids tested, a small library of bioactive peptides with basic residues was also investigated, with importance and applications in several fields [167]. The results showed that the stability of the complexes depends on the anionic groups decorating the receptor and increases according to the following trend: O-methylenecarboxylate < phosphonate < sulfate < phosphate. Due to their electron-rich cavities and anionic functional groups this type of receptor fails to bind peptides lacking basic amino acids, showing, in the other hand, high affinity ( µ Mrange) for peptides bearing arginine and/or lysine residues, being the last generally more stable probably due to charge delocalization in the guanidinium groups. The highest affinities were reported for the peptides comprising several adjacent lysine residues at the N -terminal which provide more sites to form ionic interactions while minimizing the repulsion of the C-terminal [25].",

        "content": "Despite the clear difficulty in the binding and recognition of the biological targets here presented, supramolecular systems begin to approach affinities and selectivities that are observable in nature, as is the case of protein-protein interactions, lock-and-key complementarity and the highly specific antigen-antibody recognition. Furthermore, many of the receptors explored here already possess the ability to directly modify or detect their target analytes, despite the majority of them presenting simple, modular structures. This is the case of p -sulfonatocalix[4]arene and cucurbit[n]urils, which can modulate the properties of proteins, such as cytochrome c and Casp-8, respectively. Additionally, some of these receptors present either an intrinsic colorimetric or fluorometric response in the presence of the respective ligands, e.g., the tweezers MPT and MCT, making them especially promising in sensing applications. Moreover, these characteristics are not the only ones that can be explored, seeing as the receptors can also be integrated in more complex structures, as synthetic binding pockets, with the addition of other groups for the creation of new functionalities.\nThe logical steps going forward are the continuous creation of new receptors, the eventual conjugation of several of these molecules for the multivalent binding of one complex analyte with several binding sights and smaller modifications and optimizations of the preexisting receptors, to enhance their selectivity and affinity towards one particular target ligand.\nFunding: This research was funded by the Associate Laboratory for Green Chemistry-LAQV (UIDB/50006/2020), financed by FCT/MCTES.\nData Availability Statement: No new data were created or analyzed in this study.
