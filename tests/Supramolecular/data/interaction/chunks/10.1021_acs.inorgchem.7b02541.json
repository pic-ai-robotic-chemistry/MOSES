        "content": "The design of a molecular receptor for obtaining probes or sensors that are speci /uniFB01 c of one molecular target is an important /uniFB01 eld of research. This is particularly true in biology, where new tools are needed in order to get qualitative and quantitative information for understanding a mechanism or for diagnostics. For this purpose, water-soluble molecular receptors are required for the speci /uniFB01 c detection of biologically active compounds. In that /uniFB01 eld, biological amines are important targets, as they are correlated to various diseases. 1,2 Primary alkylamines are also widely used in industry 3 in spite of their toxicity for the environment and aquatic organisms. 4 To play the role of a probe, these receptors must be equipped with a reporting tool. Classically, /uniFB02 uorescence or luminescence are chosen due to their sensitivity. 5,6 However, they su /uniFB00 er several limitations such as bleaching or sensitivity to the environment and di /uniFB03 cult quanti /uniFB01 cation without internal reference. Their use is also restricted by the penetration of photons. Electrochemical probes is another strategy, but it is limited as well by the intrinsic response to the contact with the electrode. Besides host -guest studies involving nitroxide spin probes, 7 very little has been reported on EPR as a detection tool. 8 This technique\no /uniFB00 ers several advantages: when based on the intrinsic response of a stable metal ion such as Cu II , it may allow ex and in vivo monitoring and be little a /uniFB00 ected by the biological environment, provided it is not reduced, i.e. has a low redox potential. This is particularly important in cells, where Fe III presents a very distinct signal. Nevertheless, it has to be very speci /uniFB01 c, particularly vs anions that classically bind preferentially to the metal ion over the targeted molecules such as amines. It also must overpass severe obstacles: the water solvent is a good competitive ligand and readily provides hydroxide and protonates amines.\nOver the last few years, following a biomimetic strategy, we have developed molecular receptors that associate the coordination properties of a metal ion in a well-de /uniFB01 ned environment to the hosting properties of a cavity (Figure 1). 9",

The selectivity of the receptor is based on the relative a /uniFB03 nity of the guest for (i) the metal ion, (ii) the second coordination sphere, and (iii) the shape and size of the macrocycle. The latter point appears crucial for recognition. With calix[6]arene presenting a coordination core at the small rim, there is only space for one guest binding inside the cavity and the oxygen-rich small rim surrounding the coordination site makes it prone at hosting hydrogen-bond donors. As a result, the calix system displays very high a /uniFB03 nity for primary amines and disfavors anion coordination. Indeed, primary amines /uniFB01 t very well in the cone.

Therefore, we turned to develop funnel complexes that display much stronger binding constants to metal ions, namely the calix[6]azacryptands (Figure 1). These hosts present a calix covalently capped by a Ntripod, which presents two merits: it preorganizes the metal ion binding site through a strong chelate e /uniFB00 ect and constrains the calix into a cone, well-shaped for guest inclusion. As a result, the metal coordination is much stronger, which is important in water, and the guest a /uniFB03 nity much higher, which is important for sensitivity. The /uniFB01 rst water-soluble calix[6]azacryptand was the one equipped with a tmpa [tmpa: tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine] cap and three quaternary ammonium (-NMe3 + ) directly grafted at the aromatic cores. 12 However, host -guest studies revealed very di /uniFB00 erent properties as compared to calix[6]arenetris(imidazole): strong a /uniFB03 nity for anions and low a /uniFB03 nity for primary amines. 13 The reason for such a di /uniFB00 erence stems from the di /uniFB00 erent calix conformation. With the /uniFB02 exible tris(imidazole) system, the phenoxyl units connected to the N -donors are projected toward the center of the cavity. As a result, the corresponding oxygen lone pairs are well oriented for Hbonding to guest primary amines and are repulsive for anions (Figure 3). 14 With the rigid tmpa cap, the calix adopts the opposite conformation: the phenoxyl units connected to the N -donor site are pushed into the exo position, directing their lone pair toward the solvent.

It was found that heptylamine readily displaces octanol, and the corresponding relative a /uniFB03 nity constant K octylamine / K heptanol was evaluated to be >20, whereas another competition experiment showed the following relative a /uniFB03 nity order: PhCH2NH2 > PhCN > PhCH2OH. 22\nthat are deprived of coordination properties. Quite remarkably, in spite of these obstacles, the Cu II complex based on ligand 4 revealed itself to be an excellent receptor for various molecules. Like [Cu 1] · 2+ , it selectively binds neutral ligands such as nitriles or alcohols with no detectable interaction with competitive anions. This is attributed to the similar small rim pattern. It also selectively binds primary amines, in spite of their protonated state in water at pH = 7. The pseudo -p K a value corresponding to the couple [Cu 4(RNH2)] 5+ · / RNH3 + was estimated for octylamine to be as low as 3.4. This, compared to the p K a value of free octylamine, 10.6, 31 indicates a p K a shift of more than 7 units. This impressive result shows the extraordinary stabilization of the amine due to its complexation to the metal cation inside the calixarene cavity.",

        "content": "The receptor properties of funnel complexes based on calix[6]arene depend on a number of points: (i) the Lewis acidity of the bound metal ion, tuned by the /uniFB01 rst coordination sphere implemented at the small rim, (ii) the solvent that can coordinate the metal center, (iii) the rigidity of the calixarene macrocycle for which covalent capping plays a key role, (iv) the substitution pattern at the aromatic units (at both large and small rims). Ligands 1 and 4 present very similar properties. Indeed, a tren unit insures strong binding of the metal ion and maintains the calixarene into a cone conformation with an increased rigidity compared to the tris-imidazole system, and the same substitution pattern is present at the small rim, which gives rise to similar second coordination sphere e /uniFB00 ects. The major structural di /uniFB00 erence stems from the replacement of three t Bu groups by triazole units connected to quaternary ammonium moieties. Such a substitution pattern has been shown to enlarge the hydrophobic cavity of the calixarene. 11,30 Actually, the most important di /uniFB00 erence between both systems stems from the solvent in which they are studied. With calix 1 , a noncoordinating solvent can be chosen, and only residual water competes with the guest for the /uniFB01 fth coordination site embedded in the calix cavity. With calix 4 , water is the solvent, and it strongly competes for the coordination to the metal ion. It is also a protic medium that can interact with the guest, transforming the amino-guests, for example, into ammoniums\nHence, receptor [Cu 4] · 5+ , although in water, displays selectivity similar to that reported for its organo-soluble analog, [Cu 1] · 2+ , but it bene /uniFB01 ts from the triazole-extended cavity and from the hydrophobic e /uniFB00 ect: the longer the apolar chain, the better the recognition ( K octylamine / K propylamine = ca. 100), which is the converse in organic solvent.",

        "content": "When compared with water-soluble Zn II funnel complexes obtained with the /uniFB01 rst generation of calix[6]-ligands (bearing three imidazole arms instead of a tren unit, see Figures 1 and 2), a number of improved properties are highlighted: (i) the metal complex [Cu 4] · 5+ is stable even in the absence of a guest, (ii) this receptor is responsive not only to amines but also to weaker donors such as alcohols and nitriles, (iii) hydrophilic amines such as propylamine are also recognized, and /uniFB01 nally (iv) the pH window for the complexation of amines is much wider [(3 -12) vs (6 -10)]. Quite interestingly, the p K a shift estimated for primary ammoniums in the presence of receptor [Cu 4] · 5+ is similar to the one found for the tris-imidazole-based receptor (also 7 units). 11 This suggests that major roles in the hosting process are played by the calix-core: H-bonding at the small rim, CH -π interactions with the aromatic walls, and the hydrophobic e /uniFB00 ect. It is noteworthy that such polyvalence in water for a receptor has been rarely described in the literature and recognition of amines in acidic conditions (pH = 3) is also very rare. It is also interesting to compare this water-soluble copper complex receptor studied in pure water with the organo-soluble complex [Zn 1] · 2+ studied in micelles. 19 In micelles, it was found that the selectivity, albeit di /uniFB00 erent from the one observed in organic solvents, was still in favor of\nsmaller hydrophilic amines ( K heptylamine / K propylamine is 0.5 and 0.25 × 10 -3 in micelles and in chloroform, respectively).",

It displayed a good selectivity for hydrophobic primary amines with a positive response to biologically important molecules such as tyramine and tryptamine. These remarkable features may be exploited for the development of a selective sensor for biologically relevant amines such as polyamines, tryptamine derivatives, and lysine rich-peptides, with EPR spectroscopy as an e /uniFB03 cient detection tool, which is complementary to electrochemistry and /uniFB02 uorescence at presenting very di /uniFB00 erent advantages and drawbacks.",

Chemical shifts of the HDO 2 signals as a function of temperature were referenced according to values found in the literature. 32 High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained with a QTOF spectrometer. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Elexsys spectrometer (X-band) at T = 100 K. UV -vis spectroscopy was performed with a V670 JASCO spectrophotometer. The electrochemical studies have been performed with a homedesigned three-electrode cell connected to an Autolab PGSTAT 100 (Ecochemie) potentiostat monitored by a computer. The reference electrode used was a silver/silver chloride (NaCl 3M) system (Ag/ AgCl). The working electrode (glassy carbon) was polished on alumina (3 μ m) before use, and the auxiliary electrode was a platinum wire. Phosphate bu /uniFB00 er (12.5 mM) was used as supporting salt (with ca. 10 -4 -10 -3 M in electroactive species), and the experiments were performed by bubbling N2 into the solution. As for the EPR pH studies, the copper complex ( ∼ 1 mg) was dissolved in 300 μ L of water and the pH of the solution was measured. 100 μ L of this solution was taken for the EPR measurement. The solution in the EPR tube was then recombined with the mother solution, the pH of which was modi ed by addition of HCl/NaOH. /uniFB01",

In the case of calix[6]tren, the distortion from TBP ( τ = 0.70) observed in the solid state was due not only to the elongation of the Cu -NH bond but also to a relatively small value of the angle between the tertiary nitrogen atom and the\ncoordinating guest molecule (168.8 instead of 180 ° in the case of the EtOH complex). This was attributed to hydrogen-bonding of the guest EtOH to one oxygen of the calixarene skeleton, at the small rim (see ref 18). For a comparison of the EPR parameters of the Cu II complexes in water herein described and those measured for the analogous complexes in CH2Cl2, see the Supporting Information.",

Indeed, the formation of aggregates certainly depends on the presence/absence of guest ligand, as has been reported in our previous work with water-soluble calixarenes.

This bathochrome shift corresponds to a change of the geometry from\nSPB to TBP (trigonal bipyramidal), which corroborates the EPR data.
