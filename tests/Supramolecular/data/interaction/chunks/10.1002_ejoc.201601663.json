Fluorescence titration of 1a -c using mono cationic aromatic hydrocarbon G1 and G2 as g uests revealed that 1 prefers to form a host -guest complex with pyrene derivative G2 rather than anthracene derivative G1 . Complex formation between the derivatives  of 1 and G2 were in a 1:1 equimolar ratio with binding constants of ~8 × 10 3 (M -1 ),  regardles s  of  the  substitution  groups  on the triazine rings. Additionally, we found that the molecular recognition of 1 was successfully fine -tuned through post -modification  of  the  triazine  rings.  When  dicationic  anthracence G3 was used as a guest, only 1b formed a host -guest complex ( K a  = 5.5 × 10 3 M -1 ).\nfor metal ion (Cu 2+ ) [ 1 3 ] and car bohydrate recognition, respectively.

[ 1 5 ] This advantage allows us to concisely design and construct  various  sizes  and  shapes  of  triazine -based  hosts. Furthermore, triazine -based hosts can be easily post -functionalized  through  S N Ar  or  metal -catalyzed  cross -coupling react ions on the triazine ring. Although diverse skeletal triazine -based  hosts  have  been  reported, almost all of them  are insoluble in water due to their highly hydrophobic characteristics. Therefore,  the  guest -recognition  properties  of  triazine -based hosts in aqueous media have been virtually unexplored.",

[ 4 ] In addition, molecular recognition contribute developing the field of ÒMolecular machineÓ,  which  won the  Novel  P rize  in Chemistry 2016 . [ 5 ] Accordingly,  the  development  of  novel  macroc yclic hosts  in supramolecular  chemistry  is  a  fundamental  task  for  creating advanced molecular systems. For this  purpose,  many  kinds  of macrocyclic hosts including cyclodextrin, [ 6 ] calixarene, [ 7 ] cucurbituril, [ 8 ] pillararene, [ 9 ] and  cyclophane [ 10 ] derivativ es  have been  developed  in  past  decades.  Among  them,  water -soluble hosts  are  undoubtedly  recognized  as  the  most  reliable  and practical candidates for the above -mentioned applications.\nRecently, much effort has been devoted for the development of triazine -based hosts such as heterocalix[2]arene[2]triazine [ 1 1 a ] because  of  their  unique  host -functions. [ 1 1 ] Triazine -based hosts are capable of capturing broad scope of guest molecules based on the nature of triazine ring. The electron deficient nature of the tri azine ring is applicable for anion sensing, such as fluoride and chloride ions, through anion -π interactions.

        "content": "Water -solubility of macrocyclic hosts is generally improved by  introducing  hydrophilic  groups  in  a  precise  position  on  the macrocycle  without  disturbing the parent host -function. For example, a calixarene de rivative was solubilized in water through  the  introduction  of  hydrophilic  groups  on  the  upper  or lower rim of the macrocycle. [ 1 6 ] Our group has developed water -solubule  tetraaza[6,1,6,1]paracyclophanes  where  the  bridged nitrogen  atoms  are  functionalized  wi th  hydrophilic  groups  such as  ammonium, carboxylates, and saccharides. [ 1 7 ] These water -soluble tetraazacyclophanes maintain their parent host -function, and we have successfully evaluated their host -guest property in aqueous media. NMe2\nMolecular structure of novel water-soluble triazinophanes Ia-c\nBased on our previous approach for solubilizing tetraazacyclophane in water, we designed the new water -soluble triazinophane 1a -c ( Fig 1 ). Four  anionic  caroboxylate  side chains  on  the  bridged -nitrogen  of 1 improve  its  hydrophilicity thereby allowing eval uation of host -guest properties in aqueous media.  The  macrocyclic  core  constructed  by  triazine  and  4,4Õ -diaminodiphenylmethane is anticipated to give a larger hydrophobic cavity compared to previous triazine -based hosts. [ 10 ] We  thus  hope  that 1 is  capable of  accommodating relative  large  sized  guest  molecules  in  its  internal  hydrophobic cavity,  expanding  the  scope  of  targetable  guest  molecules  of triazine -based hosts. In addition, 1 can be conventionally derivatized through post -functionalization using a S N A r  reaction on  the  triazine  ring  of  common  intermediate 5 .  This  allows  for investigation  of  the  relationships  between  host -structure  and guest -recognition  properties.  We  herein  report  the  synthesis  of water -soluble  triazinophane 1 ,  the  structural  analysis, and  the evaluation  of  the  molecular  recognition  properties  in  aqueous media using anthracene and pyrene cationic aromatic hydrocarbons derivatives as guest molecules.",

Alkylation with reactive methyl bromoacetate smoothly proceeded and gave corresponding N -alkylated product 5 in good  yield. In contrast, any other functionalization  of  the  bridged  nitrogen  such  as  condensation with  an  activated  ester  or  alkylation  with  a  non -activated  alkyl halide failed and resulted in the recovery of 5 (data not shown).

[ 20 ] Fluorescence quenching of G2 was observed upon the addition of 1a -c and showed saturation behav io r , whereas that of G1 was quite  small  and  not  sat urated  even  in  the  presence  of  100 equivalents of 1a -c ( Fig S4 -S 6 ). Job -plot analysis indicates that 1a -c forms  a  host -guest  complex  with G2 in  a  1:1  equimolar ratio ( Fig S4 -S6 ). Based  on  these  outcomes,  the  binding constants  of 1a -c for G2 were  calculated using  the  Benesi -Hildebrand  method [ 2 1 ] as  summarized  in Table  1 .  The  binding constants  for G2 were  appropriately  ~8 × 10 3 and  comparable, regardless  of  the  substitution  group  on  the  triazine  ring.  In contrast,  the  binding  affinity  of 1 for G1 was  too  weak  t o calculate in our experimental system due to the limited solubility of 1a -c .  In  the  control  experiment  that  used  anionic G4 as  a guest, no interaction was observed, likely due to the electrostatic repulsion between the carboxylate groups of 1 and G4 ( Fig S7 ). Given  the  significance  of  electrostatic  interactions  for  guest -recognition  of 1 ,  we  subsequently  performed  the  fluorescence titration for G3 , as a dicationic analogue of G1 .
