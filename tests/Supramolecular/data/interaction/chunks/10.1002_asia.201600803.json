[5-7] Among the Q[ n ] homologues, Q[6] binds to some AAs bearing hydrophobic side chains, such as Phe, Ala, and Val [8, 9] while Q[7] shows higher binding affinity towards Phe in aqueous solution compared to other AAs such as Lys, Arg, His, Tyr, and Trp with different side chains. [10-12] The host-guest binding affinity of Q[ n ]s towards AAs has been rationalized in terms of a combination of electrostatic interactions involving their carbonyl portals and hydrophobic interactions involving their cavities. [13, 14] The larger cavity of Q[8] can simultaneously and selectively bind methyl viologen and secondary aromatic AAs. Complex formation in this case is driven by hydrophobic interactions as well as charge transfer between the guests and the cavity of Q[8]. [15,16] Furthermore, the use of supramolecular Q[ n ] host-guest chemistry has been employed for such applications as the real-time monitoring of enzymatic reactions and the fluorimetric detection and discrimination of AAs.

Indeed, t Q[14] is the largest cucurbit[ n ]uril yet characterized, with 14 normal glycoluril units linked by 28 methylene bridges and showing a 180 8 twist. It has two kinds of cavities (a central cavity and two side cavities) and adopts a folded, figure-ofeight conformation. As a result, it does not have a 'normal' circular cavity like the lower cucurbit[ n ]urils ( n = 5, 6, 7, 8, 10) and shows structural flexibility; it is soluble in water and DMSO. [20] t Q[14] also shows unusual binding behavior with various guest molecules in aqueous solution. For example, 4,4-bipyridyl de-' rivatives are capable of threading the t Q[14] cavity to form novel shell-like inclusion complexes. [21] Moreover, t Q[14] can accommodate one or two alkyldiammonium cations due to its two different kinds of cavities. This feature is rarely observed in conventional supramolecular hosts. [22] In the present work, we have investigated the binding interactions between t Q[14] and the 20 standard AAs in aqueous HCl solution by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and in DCl/D O 2 and [D6]DMSO by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. [23] The results show that t Q[14] displays stronger binding affinity towards AAs with a positively charged side chain or ones incorporating an aromatic ring, and weaker binding affinity towards AAs with an uncharged or negatively charged side chain. Moreover, as expected, the binding mode is seen to depend on the nature of the side chains of the AAs\n/C23 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",

Although the detailed interaction mode cannot be discerned from the available data, we presume that two Lys molecules may be simultaneously encapsulated in two side cavities of t Q[14] (mode II in Scheme 1). [22] Thus, the binding modes could be very similar to those for t Q[14] binding with protonated butanediamine or hexanediamine as discussed previously.

This is reflected by the observed more favorable enthalpy and a less favorable entropy of binding in this case. All of the experimental results imply the presence of only one host-guest interaction mode for the t Q[14]/His system. This is also the case for the binding of t Q[14] with AAs bearing an aromatic moiety (Phe, Trp, and Tyr); the aromatic ring proton signals of these AAs are subject to upshift shifts upon binding to t Q[14] (Figure S5, SI).\nBased on the above titration 1 H NMR experiments, the interactions of t Q[14] with the remaining AAs can be subdivided into two groups.

The particular AAs showing this behavior are Cys, Met, Pro, Gly (Figure S6, SI).
