The utility of using pure methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) acti-\\\\nvated by piperazine as a reactive absorbent was studied using a compact hollow fiber device for the absorber as\\\\nwell as the stripper.

At an optimal APTES loading of 0.5 g (X = 2.0), the amine-functionalized composite of MCM-41 with\\\\nstraws (APTES/M40H) has a 20% higher adsorption capacity than the amine-modified MCM-41 (APTES/MCM-41) adsorbent.\\\\nFurthermore, the CO2 adsorption capacity APTES/M40H doubles that of APTES/MCM-41 when normalized based on the\\\\ncomposition of MCM-41 in the composite particle with straws.

Abstract: \\\\nPost combustion CO2 capture using amines is one of the most well understood processes. The \\\\nmost widely used and studied solvent for this purpose is 30% Monoethanolamine (MEA). The main \\\\nissue with the process is the use of energy for stripping CO2 out of the solvent. It is anticipated that \\\\nhigher concentrations of MEA can capture a higher amount of CO2 and thus reduce energy \\\\nconsumption but may also result in a worsening of the environmental emissions due to potential \\\\nincrease in corrosion and solvent degradation.  \\\\nIn order to study the impact of 40% MEA (as opposed to 30% MEA) on the capture plant \\\\nperformance, a test campaign was carried out at the Pilot Scale Advanced Capture Technology \\\\n(PACT) facilities of the UK Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre (UKCCSRC) using 30% \\\\nand 40% MEA. The absorber (9 m height x 0.3 m dia.) is packed with 28 sections (6.5 m) of Mellapak \\\\nCC3 structured packing. The absorption column temperature profile is measured by 10 RTDs \\\\ninstalled around 48 cm apart along the column length. The performance of the capture plant in terms \\\\nof reboiler duty, capture efficiency, loading capacity and liquid to gas ratio is evaluated at different \\\\noperating conditions.  \\\\nIt has been found that specific reboiler duty using 40% MEA drops by up to 14% as compared \\\\nto that with 30% MEA under similar test conditions. It has also been observed that the process is very \\\\nsensitive to reboiler temperature and slight changes in reboiler temperature can have a significant \\\\nimpact on the plant performance. Moreover, similar energy and capture performance can be achieved \\\\nat different reboiler temperatures with right combination of temperature and pressure in the \\\\nreboiler/stripper. Corrosion rate was found to be higher with 40% MEA than 30% MEA. Solvent \\\\ndegradation rate and solvent carry over has also indicated slightly higher levels for 40%.

A soft-\\\\ntemplate approach and interfacial polymerization are used to give capsules with liquid\\\\ncore (64 wt %) and polyurea shell. Compared to the bulk liquid, the encapsulated liquid\\\\nshows improved thermal stability over cycles of absorption at 25 °C, and desorption at 75\\\\n°C. The capsules with core of [BMIM][BF4]-MEA show 0.2 mol CO2/kg of capsules at 1\\\\nbar CO2, compared to the bulk liquid, which has 0.05 mol CO2/kg of sorbent.

Subsequently, the developed models were used to examine the CO2\\\\ncapture performance of these hybrid solvents in terms of absorption cyclic capacity and heat of regeneration as\\\\nkey performance indicators using a simple and short-cut estimation method. Results show that for the same total\\\\namine mass concentration, non-aqueous amine solvents possess a 30–40% decrease in total heat of regeneration\\\\ncompared to their aqueous counterparts at the expense of a 10–50% reduction in cyclic capacity. These results\\\\nvalidate the reliability of the molecular modelling approach as an attractive and valuable tool for the screening\\\\nof chemical solvents and process modelling.'\",\n",

To overcome these challenges, three \\\\nmodified heterogeneous mesoporous catalysts, CMK-3-SiO2, CMK-3-MCM-41, CMK-3-SBA-15, \\\\nand SO42-/ZrO2 solid acid catalyst were initially synthesized and investigated to determine their \\\\ncatalytic effectiveness in the process of CO2 and MEA solvent regeneration with CO2 loading of \\\\n0.5±0.02 mol CO2/mol MEA at 97oC. According to the experimental results, the CMK-3 modified \\\\ncatalyst significantly decreases the energy requirement for CO2 desorption. The catalytic \\\\nperformance of the synthesized catalysts was in the order of CMK-3-SiO2 > CMK-3-MCM-\\\\n41>CMK-3-SBA-15>SZ respectively. CMK-3-SiO2 exhibited the best catalytic performance by \\\\nenhancing desorption rate by 195%, and decreasing the energy requirement by 37.41% compared \\\\nwith the monoethanol amine as a blank run. Furthermore, the CMK-3-SiO2 catalyst exhibited the \\\\nbest catalytic performance compared to the literature with an excellent stability and with no \\\\nunfavorable effects on the MEA-CO2 absorption activity for the regenerated amine solvent. This \\\\nperformance seems to be a result of the large mesoporous surface area (BET) and large number of \\\\nBrϕnsted and Lewis acid sites.

Moreover, the CO2 absorption performance of aqueous DEAB solution was further compared with\\\\ndiﬀerent amine solutions, which reveals that the CO2 absorption ﬂux of DEAB is higher than those of DEA, MDEA\\\\nand AMP, and is also comparable to MEA.

The kinetics behaviors of CO2 absorbed in the two non-aqueous\\\\nblended amine systems are discussed in brief according to the molecular structures of the two tertiary amines.\\\\nDiﬀerent from the traditional aqueous systems, this study proved that tertiary amine enhanced the ability of\\\\nprimary amine to absorb CO2 which is due to tertiary amine didn’t react with CO2 directly in a non-aqueous\\\\nsystem. The result in the non-aqueous system also shows that DMEA is more easily participate in the termole-\\\\ncular reaction between MEA and CO2 compared with DEEA, which indicate the length of alkyl chain on nitrogen\\\\natom also plays an important role in the enhancement eﬀect. Additionally, after comparing the kinetic data of\\\\nthe two blended amine systems under aqueous and non-aqueous conditions, it can be found that tertiary amine\\\\ncan participate in the termolecular reaction between MEA and CO2, and that the protonated MEA can be re-\\\\nconverted to free MEA by the tertiary amine, making it easier for MEA to participate in its own termolecular\\\\nreactions, so that the overall reaction rate of the blended amine system is accelerated. It can be summarized that\\\\nthere are interactions between the tertiary amine and the primary amine in the non-aqueous blended amine\\\\nsystem that positively promote the kinetics.'\",\n",

Herein, we report a highly eﬃcient dual-function material for\\\\nsimultaneous Au(III) detection and recovery by simply introducing abundant\\\\nimidazole thione and thioether groups in one system. This material, that is, an\\\\nimidazole thione-modiﬁed polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS-2),\\\\nwas prepared by a mild reaction of an imidazolium-containing POSS and\\\\nsulfur at ambient temperature. The POSS-2 suspension in water can rapidly\\\\nand selectively detect Au(III) with a very low limit of detection of 1.2 ppb by\\\\nﬂuorescence quenching or a visualized color change from white to dark\\\\norange. POSS-2 can also selectively and eﬃciently capture Au(III) with a\\\\nmaximum adsorption uptake of 1486.5 mg/g. The adsorption process well ﬁts\\\\nwith the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir models. The intriguing\\\\ndual-function performance is better than most of the previous Au(III) probes\\\\nor adsorbents. The mechanism study reveals that the detection and adsorption behavior are mainly caused by the redox reaction and\\\\ncoordination between imidazole thione and thioether groups and Au(III). Furthermore, POSS-2 was successfully utilized to extract\\\\ngold without interference from a discard CPU. These results indicate the potential application of the present dual-function material\\\\nfor Au(III) detection and recovery from aqueous solutions.

However, complexity and nonlinearity of the capture processes hinder the incorporation of \\\\ntheir first principles models into analyses and optimizations of overall carbon management strategies. \\\\nAccordingly, it is desirable to have a systematic method to develop a computationally less demanding \\\\nsurrogate model, which can replace the rigorous CO2 capture process model, for use in a high-level \\\\ndecision-making environment. For such purposes, the surrogate model should be able to provide \\\\nmultiple information needed to connect to subsequent processing steps under varying source stream \\\\nconditions. This research addresses the development of surrogate models for CO2 capture processes that \\\\nenjoy significantly lowered complexity while preserving the key information. A surrogate model can \\\\nbe constructed by fitting the input-output data generated by process simulation and optimization with \\\\nthe rigorous model. Following the proposed method, surrogate models for the amine-based CO2 capture \\\\nprocesses with two representative types of amines, monoethanolamine (MEA) and piperazine (PZ), are \\\\nconstructed and validated. The constructed surrogate models predict the specific steam consumption \\\\nrate and total equipment purchase cost based on the input information of desired capture rate and CO2 \\\\nsource stream condition.

Herein, a simple\\\\nchemical modiﬁcation approach is employed to functionalize\\\\nbiomass ﬂy ash (BFA) with 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane\\\\n(APTES) to develop an inexpensive and eﬃcient adsorbent for\\\\nwater remediation. The amine-functionalized BFA (BFA−APTES)\\\\nwas fully characterized by employing a range of characterization\\\\ntechniques. Adsorption behavior of BFA−APTES was evaluated\\\\nagainst two anionic dyes, namely, alizarin red S (ARS) and\\\\nbromothymol blue (BTB). In the course of experimental data\\\\nanalysis, the computation tools of data ﬁtting for linear and\\\\nnonlinear form of Langmuir, Freundlich, and the modiﬁed\\\\nLangmuir−Freundlich adsorption isotherms were used with the aid of Matlab R2019b. In order to highlight the misuse of\\\\nlinearization of adsorption models, the sum of the squares of residues (SSE) values obtained from nonlinear models are compared\\\\nwith R2 values obtained from the linear regression. The accuracy of the data ﬁtting was checked by the use of SSE as an error\\\\nfunction instead of the coeﬃcient of determination, R2. The dye adsorption capacity of BFA−APTES was also compared with the\\\\nnonfunctionalized BFA. The maximum adsorption capacities of BFA−APTES for ARS and BTB dye molecules were calculated to be\\\\naround 13.42 and 15.44 mg/g, respectively. This value is approximately 2−3 times higher than the pristine BFA. A reasonable\\\\nagreement between the calculated and experimental values of qe obtained from the nonlinear form of kinetic models veriﬁed the\\\\nimportance of using equations in their original form. The experimentally calculated thermodynamic parameters including molar\\\\nstandard Gibbs free energy (ΔadGm\\\\n0 ) and molar standard enthalpy change (ΔadHm\\\\n0 ) reﬂected that the process of adsorption of dye\\\\nmolecules on the BFA−APTES adsorbent was spontaneous and exothermic in nature. Moreover, the used BFA−APTES adsorbent\\\\ncould be regenerated and reused for several cycles with signiﬁcant dye adsorption capacity. The remediation capability of the BFA−\\\\nAPTES adsorbent against ARS dye was also demonstrated by packing a small column ﬁlled with the BFA−APTES adsorbent and\\\\npassing a solution of ARS through it. Overall, we provide a simple and scalable route to convert BFA into an eﬃcient adsorbent for\\\\nwater remediation applications.'\",\n",

In order to reduce volume and increase autonomy, captured CO2 is stored\\\\nas a liquid, therefore, a specific installation is planned. The system is hybridised with an organic rankine\\\\ncycle (ORC) to reduce the energy penalty on the CCS system. Results show that a CCS system\\\\noperating with Monoethanolamine (MEA) at 30 wt% achieved a maximum CO2 capture rate of 66%,\\\\nwith a penalty over the power engine of only 10%. On the other hand, the economic analysis showed\\\\nthat the CCS system with MEA and without ORC is 31.8% cheaper than a hydrogen fuel cells bus and\\\\n26% cheaper than a battery-electric bus. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons,\\\\nLtd.\\\\nKeywords: CO2 capture; amine-scrubbing; internal combustion engines; organic Rankine cycle'\",\n",

Absorption performance is significantly affected\\\\nby the molecular structure and water concentration in the amine solution. The absorption performance\\\\nof the MDEA system is better than that of TEA, which is basically ascribed to the MDEA molecule’s\\\\nmore asymmetric and irregular shape than that of TEA, which thus enhances the catalytic activity of\\\\nMDEA and the reactivity of the −OH moiety in water. The difference of electrical properties such as\\\\nionic conductivities (ICs) of the two protonated amines and real ionic activity coefficients (RIAC)\\\\nbetween the two systems might be also caused by the different molecular structures of the two amines.\\\\nThe IC of protonated MDEA is estimated to be 23.70% higher than that of protonated TEA, because of\\\\nthe higher ionic mobility and charge density of MDEA.

To over-\\\\ncome these limitations, for the ﬁrst time in this study, amine based deep eutectic solvents (DES) are\\\\nincorporated into membranes for CO2 capture. Three different alkanolamines; monoethanolamine,\\\\n(MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), triethanolamine (TEA) were selected as HBDs and choline chloride as\\\\nHBA. The synthesis of the DESs was conﬁrmed by FTIR characterization as well as physicochemical prop-\\\\nerties of the resulting liquid mixture. Subsequently, the synthesized DESs were impregnated into the por-\\\\nous support to prepare supported liquid membranes (SLMs). The SLMs showed excellent selectivity of\\\\nCO2 up to 70.47 and 78.86 for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 respectively. This high selectivity of CO2 over CH4\\\\nand N2 can be attributed to the chemisorption of CO2 with DES and high basicity of DES. The effect of\\\\noperating temperature, the HBA: HBD mole ratio, and CO2 concentration on membrane performance\\\\nwas also investigated. The results of amine DESs were compared with the competing ionic liquids based\\\\nmembranes, and the signiﬁcant high gas separation was attributed to the low viscosity and the high CO2\\\\nsolubility in amines that makes them an appropriate alternative to the conventional ILs.\\\\n\\\\x01 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The gas and water vapor sorption and permeability coefficients for the PTMSP/PVTMS\\\\nblend membranes at different PVTMS contents (0–100%) were obtained under temperatures of 30 and\\\\n60 ◦C for the first time. As the PVTMS content increases, the O2 and CO2 permeabilities decrease by 160\\\\nand 195 times at 30 ◦C, respectively. The fractional accessible volume of the polymer blends decreases\\\\naccordingly. The transport of the CO2 capture solvent vapors through the PTMSP/PVTMS blend\\\\nmembranes were determined in thermo-pervaporation (TPV) mode using aqueous monoethanolamine\\\\n(30%), N-methyldiethanolamine (40%), and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (30%) solutions as model\\\\namine solvents at 60 ◦C.

The single-crystal\\\\nX-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that all the MOFs feature a\\\\nsimilar type of three-dimensional structure having a binuclear\\\\n[Cd2(COO)4(N)4] secondary building block unit. Moreover,\\\\nMOFs 1 and 2 contain one-dimensional channels along the b-\\\\naxis, whereas MOF 3 possesses a 1D channel along the a-axis. In these MOFs, the pores are decorated with multifunctional groups,\\\\ni.e., halogen and amine. The gas adsorption analysis of these MOFs demonstrate that they display high uptake of CO2 (up to 5.34\\\\nmmol/g) over N2 and CH4. The isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) value for CO2 at zero loadings is in the range of 18−26 kJ mol−1.\\\\nIn order to understand the mechanism behind the better adsorption of CO2 by our MOFs, we have also performed configurational\\\\nbias Monte Carlo simulation studies, which confirm that the interaction between our MOFs and CO2 is stronger compared to those\\\\nwith N2 and CH4. Various noncovalent interactions, e.g., halogen (X)···O, Cd···O, and O···O, between CO2 and the halogen atom,\\\\nthe Cd(II) metal center, and the carboxylate group from the MOFs are observed, respectively, which may be a reason for the higher\\\\ncarbon dioxide adsorption. Ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) calculations of MOF 1 demonstrate that the obtained selectivity\\\\nvalues for CO2/CH4 (50:50) and CO2/N2 (15:85) are ca. 28 and 193 at 273 K, respectively. However, upon increasing the\\\\ntemperature to 298 K, the selectivity value (S = 34) decreases significantly for the CO2/N2 mixture. We have also calculated the\\\\nbreakthrough analysis curves for all the MOFs using mixtures of CO2/CH4 (50:50) and CO2/N2 (50:50 and 15:85) at different\\\\nentering gas velocities and observed larger retention times for CO2 in comparison with other gases, which also signifies the stronger\\\\ninteraction between our MOFs and CO2. Moreover, due to the presence of Lewis acidic metal centers, these MOFs act as\\\\nheterogeneous catalysts for the CO2 fixation reactions with different epoxides in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide\\\\n(TBAB), for conversion into industrially valuable cyclic carbonates. These MOFs exhibit a high conversion (96−99%) of\\\\nepichlorohydrin (ECH) to the corresponding cyclic carbonate 4-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-2-one after 12 h of reaction time at 1\\\\nbar of CO2 pressure, at 65 °C. The MOFs can be reused up to four cycles without compromising their structural integrity as well as\\\\nwithout losing their activity significantly.\\\\nKEYWORDS: metal−organic frameworks, carbon dioxide, adsorption, selectivity, heterogeneous catalysis, Monte Carlo simulation'\",\n",

However, extensive energy input and severe\\\\nequipment corrosion constitute their major and inherent drawbacks due to the involvement of\\\\nvast amounts of water as the diluent. Water-lean absorbents are proposed to deliver potential\\\\nbeneﬁts, such as higher capacity and enhanced energy eﬃciency, by abandoning the aqueous\\\\nsolvent or replacing it with organic counterparts. Great eﬀorts have been devoted to the\\\\ndevelopment of CO2 capture protocols under nonaqueous circumstance, but their industrial\\\\ndeployment is still challenged by the exponentially increasing viscosity during operation. In this\\\\nwork, a series of alkoxy-functionalized methylamines have been devised as single-component\\\\npostcombustion CO2 absorbents under water-lean condition. These nonaqueous amines are\\\\ncapable of reversibly capturing CO2 with low viscosities (48−114 cP at 25 °C and 27−63 cP at\\\\n40 °C) at their maximal gravimetric capacities (15−21 wt % at 25 °C and 14−21 wt % at 40\\\\n°C). Comprehensive mechanistic studies by means of in situ Fourier transform infrared\\\\nspectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and control experiments revealed that the\\\\nstabilization of sequestered CO2 via intramolecular hydrogen bonding between in situ formed carbamic acid and the ﬂexible alkoxy\\\\nside chain of the designed amines would play the key role in enhancing both the capacity and ﬂowability. Meanwhile, thermal\\\\ndesorption of the captured CO2 could easily be carried out at a feasible temperature (75 °C) under ambient pressure, and the CO2-\\\\nsaturated absorbents have remained intact at 80 °C for 2 days within a closed system. Furthermore, these novel amines would exhibit\\\\nconsiderable physisorption by operating at high-pressure conditions (20 and 30 bar), thanks to the inherent CO2-philicity of the\\\\nalkoxy functionality.

The analysis of\\\\nbiogas upgrading experiments with diﬀerent MEA derivatives\\\\nshows that methyl and butyl are more favorable for improving CO2\\\\nabsorption and meeting the biogas upgrading eﬀect of methane purity for a long period of time applicable in some countries, and\\\\nethyl is more conducive to the regeneration eﬃciency of amines. The results of the CO2 desorption heat calculations show that the\\\\nCO2 desorption heat of ethyl monoethanolamine (EMEA) (66.67 kJ/mol CO2), formed by replacing a hydrogen near the nitrogen\\\\nwith an ethyl group, is signiﬁcantly lower than those of methyl monoethanolamine (MMEA) (73.04 kJ/mol CO2) and butyl\\\\nmonoethanolamine (BMEA) (73.27 kJ/mol CO2), formed by replacing a hydrogen near the nitrogen with a methyl group and a\\\\nbutyl group, respectively. The CO2 desorption heats were signiﬁcantly lower than those of MEA (82.12 kJ/mol CO2), suggesting\\\\nthat ethyl can signiﬁcantly reduce the CO2 desorption heat of the amine compared to other alkyl groups.

This was a short-term solution, while Zeta potential measurements and sediment photogra-\\\\nphy over one month demonstrated long-lasting stability attributed to the incorporation of chitosan chains on the surface of \\\\namine-functionalized MWCNTs.

Notably, fossil fuel combustion significantly contributes to rising atmospheric CO2 \\\\nlevels. To address this problem, various carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies have been developed, \\\\naiming to reduce CO2 emissions and mitigate their impact on climate change. Absorption using aqueous amines \\\\nhas long been recognized as a method for removing diluted CO2 from gas streams, but it comes with drawbacks \\\\nsuch as high energy intensity and corrosion issues. The use of solid adsorbents, however, is now being seriously \\\\nconsidered as a potential alternative, offering a possibly less energy-intensive separation method. The primary \\\\nfocus of this study is to outline the recent development of advanced solid adsorbents, including zeolites, carbon- \\\\nbased materials, MOFs, COFs, boron nitride, magnetic nanoparticles, and mesoporous silica, along with their CO2 \\\\nuptake behavior. In CO2 capture procedures, selecting the appropriate adsorbent is crucial, yet it’s not a \\\\nstraightforward task to determine the most promising sorbent beforehand due to various factors affecting per\\\\xad\\\\nformance and economy. In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms, particularly artificial neural net\\\\xad\\\\nworks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) have emerged as valuable tools for predicting physical \\\\nproperties, expediting the selection of optimal adsorbents for CO2 capture, optimizing synthesis conditions of \\\\nadsorbents, and understanding advantageous variables for gas-solid interaction. The secondary objective of this \\\\nreview is to establish a correlation between recent advancements and potential future breakthroughs in the \\\\ndomain of machine learning-assisted CO2 adsorbents. In summary, this review aims to provide a comprehensive \\\\nguideline for selecting tailored solid adsorbent materials according to recently reported research to achieve high- \\\\nperformance CO2 capture.

The results indicate that the MDEA-NMP (40%H2O) and\\\\nMDEA-EG (40%H2O) systems had strong interactions, indicating their potential for CO2 capture.\\\\nHowever, adding MAE decreased interaction intensities, indicating a less favorable performance.\\\\nComplementing the RDF findings, the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) analysis quantified CO2\\\\ndiffusivity across temperatures (313 K, 323 K, and 333 K). MDEA-NMP (40%H2O) demonstrated\\\\nthe highest diffusivity, indicating superior CO2 mobility and capture efficiency. MDEA-MeOH\\\\n(40%H2O) also showed moderate diffusivity, further supporting its effectiveness. However, solvent\\\\nsystems incorporating MAE consistently displayed lower diffusivity, reinforcing the observation\\\\nfrom the RDF analysis. The temperature effect on the diffusivity of selected blends does not follow\\\\nthe regular pattern in a co-solvent-based system, whereas in an aqueous system, it increases with\\\\ntemperature. These molecular dynamic simulations highlight the critical role of solvent composition\\\\nin optimizing CO2 capture efficiency. Applying these insights can improve solvent formulations,\\\\nenhance effectiveness, and reduce costs.\\\\nKeywords: water-lean solvent; CO2 capture; molecular dynamic simulation; co-solvent'\",\n",

The synthesized sorbents were well characterized by SEM, FT-IR, N2\\\\nsorption-desorption measurement and TGA, which confirms achievement of the functionalization. The U(VI)\\\\nsorption onto these microsphere sorbents was then explored in detail. The results clearly show that these mi-\\\\ncrosphere materials especially APS-F-SiO2and COOH-F-SiO2 are indeed effective U(VI) sorbents, in terms of\\\\nconsiderable sorption capacity of ~200 mg/g, the short equilibrium time of less than 30 min, the ionic strength-\\\\nindependent nature, and desirable selectivity towards U(VI) over a range of competing ions. Moreover, the\\\\nsorbed U(VI) ions can be easily desorbed from the sorbents by controlling a lower pH, e.g. pH 1.0, and the\\\\nreclaimed sorbent can be reused without obvious reduction of U(VI) uptake even after 4 sorption-desorption\\\\ncycles, implying an excellent stability and reusability of the sorbents. These sorbents also keep high performance\\\\nin U(VI) sorption even following 400 kGy gamma irradiation in water, which further highlights the opportunity\\\\nfor this kind of materials in radionuclide separation.

The results showed stable FO water flux when wastewater effluent was used\\\\nas the source for make-up water. Repetitive CO2 loading and desorption experiments\\\\nshowed 87.0% and 88.1% CO2 re-absorption efficiency for MEA and sodium glycinate in\\\\nthe second cycle, respectively. Further investigation of this hybrid system is suggested\\\\nto advance the CO2 desorption by MD process and water production by FO process.\\\\nCrown Copyright © 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Gas chemisorption in the aqueous\\\\nphase was examined using N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) at 3 mol kg−1 concentration and piperazine (PZ) at concentrations\\\\nranging from 0.3 to 0.9 mol kg−1.

Then, the aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of PZ in combination with an amine. The\\\\nresults clearly validate the superior gas absorption performance of the microemulsion system compared to that of the nonemulsion\\\\nsystem. Furthermore, concerning the effectiveness of PZ, the results indicate that PZ is more efficient at low partial pressures of\\\\ncarbon dioxide than at high pressures. An interesting observation is that in a solution with a constant concentration of MDEA and\\\\nPZ, as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide gas changes, PZ performs optimally at a partial pressure of 0.3 bar.
