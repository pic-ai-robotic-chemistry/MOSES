When using hydrazone-modi\\\\ue103ed HNTs\\\\n(H2), the adsorption eﬃciency peaked at 94% within 30 minutes\\\\nat a pH of 3 as shown in Fig. 6. This increased adsorption eﬃ-\\\\nciency can be attributed to the presence of a greater number of\\\\namino groups in H2 sample compared to H1. The adsorption\\\\neﬃciency of EDA-modi\\\\ue103ed HNTs (H3) was found to be 66%,\\\\nwhich is notably lower than that of H1 and H2. While the NH2\\\\ngroups of EDA are protonated similar to H1 and H2, one would\\\\nexpect ethylenediamine, being a bidentate molecule with\\\\na chelating nature, to display higher eﬃciency. However, the\\\\nmolecular hindrance among them potentially impairs the\\\\nability of EDA to absorb Cr(VI) ions, leading to this diminished\\\\nadsorption value. On the other hand, sample H4 (DETA-\\\\nmodi\\\\ue103ed HNTs) reveals the adsorption eﬃciency of 58%,\\\\nwhich is even less than H1, H2, and H3 samples. At lower pH\\\\nlevels, the NH2 groups of DETA become protonated, forming\\\\nNH3\\\\n+, which then attracts chromate anions through electro-\\\\nstatic forces of attraction. Yet, since DETA acts as a tridentate\\\\nligand, it might introduce more pronounced steric hindrance\\\\nbetween the ions, subsequently causing a substantial decrease\\\\nin the adsorption eﬃciency, plummeting to 12% at elevated pH\\\\nlevels.\\\\n3.3.3\\\\nAdsorbate concentration. The adsorptive capabilities\\\\nof f-NHTs were observed across a range of metal ion concen-\\\\ntrations, spanning from 10 to 150 ppm, and conducted at a pH\\\\nof 3 for 30 minutes with 10 mg of f-HNTs. Fig. 7 illustrates the\\\\nimpact of these metal ion concentrations on the adsorption\\\\ncapacity for four distinct adsorbents: H1, H2, H3, and H4. The\\\\nobserved trend indicated that as the concentration of metal ions\\\\nrose, there was a corresponding decrease in Cr(VI) adsorption\\\\neﬃciency. All the nano-adsorbents reached their peak adsorp-\\\\ntion at 10 ppm; beyond this concentration, a decline in\\\\nadsorption was noted. This diminishing trend could be\\\\nascribed to the reduced availability of active adsorption sites\\\\nwith escalating metal concentration.\\\\n3.3.4\\\\nComparative sorption of Cr(VI) ions by f-HNTs (H1–\\\\nH4). Various f-HNTs have shown promise as nano-sorbents due\\\\nto the presence of oxygen and nitrogen-containing functional\\\\ngroups on their surface.82,83 The adsorption eﬃciency of Cr(VI)\\\\nions\\\\non\\\\nf-HNTs\\\\nwas\\\\nevaluated\\\\nat\\\\noptimized\\\\nconditions\\\\nincluding a pH of 3, a contact duration of 30 minutes, an\\\\nadsorbate concentration of 10 ppm using 10 mg of the adsor-\\\\nbent. The optimal adsorption rates of Cr(VI) ions on various f-\\\\nHNTs ranged between 58% to 94% as depicted in Fig. 8. This\\\\nadsorption range is largely in\\\\ue104uenced by the binding capacities\\\\nof the various f-HNTs with the Cr(VI) ions owing to the speci\\\\ue103c\\\\nfunctional groups intentionally introduced on the surface of\\\\nHNTs. The mechanism for this adsorption involves the elec-\\\\ntrostatic interactions and chemical bonding between Cr(VI) ions\\\\nand the surface groups of f-HNTs. The results reveal that the\\\\nincreased binding potential of f-HNTs positions them as\\\\nemerging contenders in the realm of adsorbing nanomaterials.\\\\nFig. 7\\\\nEﬀect of adsorbate concentration on the adsorption capacity of\\\\nf-HNTs (H1–H4).\\\\nFig. 5\\\\nEﬀect of contact time on the adsorption capacity of f-HNTs\\\\n(H1–H4).\\\\nFig. 6\\\\nEﬀect of pH on the adsorption capacity of f-HNTs (H1–H4).\\\\n2954 | RSC Adv., 2024, 14, 2947–2960\\\\n© 2024 The Author(s).

A comparison of Cr(VI) adsorption capacity with\\\\nother previous works has been given in Table 1. The table clearly\\\\nre\\\\ue104ects that the adsorption capacity of f-HNTs is relatively\\\\nhigher than other modi\\\\ue103ed HNTs like HDTMA-HNTs, HNT-PUS\\\\nand also SWCNTs/MWCNTs.

The adsorption process is\\\\ntypically assessed based on several characteristics of the\\\\nadsorbent surface, including the type of functional groups it\\\\ncontains. Commonly recognized mechanisms of adsorption\\\\nencompass electrostatic attraction, complexation, chelation,\\\\nand hydrogen bonding. Under acidic conditions, the proton-\\\\nation of amine groups can be readily initiated, making the\\\\nadsorption of the Cr(VI) anion through electrostatic interactions\\\\nhighly plausible. During the adsorption procedure, the solute\\\\nthat gets adsorbed onto the surface of the adsorbent is in\\\\na dynamic equilibrium with the solute concentration in the\\\\nsolution. The solute quantity adsorbed on the adsorbent surface\\\\n(represented as qe) with respect to the solute quantity at equi-\\\\nlibrium in the solution (represented as Ce) at a constant\\\\ntemperature yields an adsorption isotherm, which can be\\\\nelucidated using speci\\\\ue103c adsorption models. The well-known\\\\nFreundlich and Langmuir adsorption models, in particular,\\\\nwere employed to delineate the interaction between the adsor-\\\\nbent and the adsorbate.88,89 The data collected from all f-HNTs\\\\nnano-sorbent systems, designed for the uptake of Cr(VI) ions,\\\\nwas analyzed using the appropriate isotherms to determine the\\\\nmost \\\\ue103tting trend. The information regarding f-NHTs was\\\\nexamined using parameters from both Freundlich and Lang-\\\\nmuir adsorption isotherms. As a result, the Langmuir mono-\\\\nlayer adsorption model was deemed more suitable, suggesting\\\\nthat f-HNTs oﬀer homogenous donor sites. The nano-sorbents\\'\\\\ndiverse active sites eﬀectively adsorb Cr(VI) ions from the\\\\naqueous solution. Herein, both correlation factors and equi-\\\\nlibrium parameters were computed using Freundlich and\\\\nLangmuir adsorption models, as presented in Table 2. The\\\\ncorrelation coeﬃcients, R2 values, from these isotherms, indi-\\\\ncate that the data aligns more accurately with the Langmuir\\\\nmodel than the Freundlich model as shown in Fig. 9 and 10,\\\\nrevealing that Cr(VI) adsorption mainly adheres to the Langmuir\\\\nisotherm.

The strength of these bonds is\\\\nmanifest in the altered atomic distances within the hydrogen\\\\nbonds. In Fig. 11, the complexes of HCrO4\\\\n−with H1 and H2 are\\\\nillustrated, and the bond distances are prominently marked as\\\\nRi (where i ranges from 1 to 5). Across both complexes, a total of\\\\nfour hydrogen bonds are formed, yet the bond lengths tend to\\\\nbe notably shorter in the complex involving H2, suggesting\\\\na more robust interaction (Table 3).\\\\nOn the other hand, R2 represents the distance of the O–H\\\\nbond within the HCrO4\\\\n−anion. A lengthier R2 denotes a more\\\\npronounced transfer of the acidic proton toward the HNTs,\\\\nwhich also implies a more intense interaction.\\\\nThe H3 and H4 variants are distinguished by the diﬀering\\\\nlengths of the chains that are attached to the hydrazone moiety.\\\\nExamining the interactions within these molecular structures, it\\\\nbecomes apparent that the extended chain lengths in both cases\\\\nact as a barrier to the establishment of hydrogen bonds with\\\\nHCrO4\\\\n−, owing to the relative disposition and presence of\\\\nintramolecular\\\\nhydrogen\\\\nbonds\\\\namong\\\\nchains.\\\\nFig.\\\\n12\\\\ndemonstrates that in both scenarios, merely two hydrogen\\\\nbonds are formed.\\\\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that the OH group in HCrO4\\\\n−\\\\nplays no role in these interactions.

This discrepancy could\\\\npotentially be attributed to the inherent limitations of the\\\\nsimpli\\\\ue103ed molecular model being employed, suggesting that\\\\na more accurate representation of the interactions with HCrO4\\\\n−\\\\nmight necessitate accounting for the additional chains.\\\\n4.\\\\nConclusions\\\\nThe functionalization of pristine halloysite nanotubes was\\\\nsuccessfully achieved through the incorporation of various\\\\nentities, resulting in the creation of four distinct types of\\\\nfunctionalized halloysite nanotubes (f-HNTs). Techniques such\\\\nas FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDX were employed to characterize the\\\\nf-HNTs, con\\\\ue103rming that the functionalization was successfully\\\\nimplemented\\\\non\\\\ntheir\\\\nexternal\\\\nsurfaces.\\\\nThe\\\\nconducted\\\\nadsorption studies demonstrated a signi\\\\ue103cant dependence of\\\\nCr(VI) ions adsorption by the f-HNTs on factors including pH\\\\nlevel, duration of contact, and the concentration of Cr(VI) ions.\\\\nWhen applied for the adsorption of Cr(VI) ions, the functional-\\\\nized HNTs showcased an outstanding performance, capturing\\\\nover 90% within a mere 30 minutes at a pH level of 3 for H1 and\\\\nH2, while H3 and H4 achieved 66% and 58% adsorption,\\\\nrespectively. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm model indi-\\\\ncated a favorable adsorption process, with the RL value ranging\\\\nbetween 0 and 1. The f-HNTs featured hydroxyl and amine\\\\ngroups, and the interactions between the Cr(VI) ions and the\\\\nadsorbents were primarily electrostatic. Further investigation\\\\nthrough quantum chemical calculations disclosed that halloy-\\\\nsite nanotubes adorned with hydrazone formations (H2)\\\\nexhibited\\\\na\\\\nstronger\\\\npropensity\\\\n(interaction\\\\nenergy\\\\n−26.33 kcal mol−1) toward Cr(VI) ions. This phenomenon can be\\\\nattributed to the generation of more robust hydrogen bonds\\\\nwith the NH components of the hydrazone segment, surpassing\\\\nthe bonds formed by the OH group in oxime (H1) and the\\\\nextended amine chains seen in H3 and H4. Based on these\\\\n\\\\ue103ndings, the decorated HNTs present themselves as economi-\\\\ncally advantageous adsorbents for potential applications in\\\\nremoving Cr(VI) from polluted water. In future studies, we will\\\\nfurther investigate the performance of these decorated HNTs on\\\\nreal wastewater samples to expand their applications.\\\\nConﬂicts of interest\\\\nThere are no con\\\\ue104icts to declare.\\\\nAcknowledgements\\\\nSyed Nadeem Ahmad Shah highly appreciates the help and\\\\nsupport of Dr Jahangeer Ali Patujo and the Polymer lab facilities\\\\nFig. 12\\\\nMolecular models for H3–HCrO4\\\\n−(left) and H4–HCrO4\\\\n−\\\\n(right) complexes.

When using hydrazone-modi\\ue103ed HNTs\\n(H2), the adsorption eﬃciency peaked at 94% within 30 minutes\\nat a pH of 3 as shown in Fig. 6. This increased adsorption eﬃ-\\nciency can be attributed to the presence of a greater number of\\namino groups in H2 sample compared to H1. The adsorption\\neﬃciency of EDA-modi\\ue103ed HNTs (H3) was found to be 66%,\\nwhich is notably lower than that of H1 and H2. While the NH2\\ngroups of EDA are protonated similar to H1 and H2, one would\\nexpect ethylenediamine, being a bidentate molecule with\\na chelating nature, to display higher eﬃciency. However, the\\nmolecular hindrance among them potentially impairs the\\nability of EDA to absorb Cr(VI) ions, leading to this diminished\\nadsorption value. On the other hand, sample H4 (DETA-\\nmodi\\ue103ed HNTs) reveals the adsorption eﬃciency of 58%,\\nwhich is even less than H1, H2, and H3 samples. At lower pH\\nlevels, the NH2 groups of DETA become protonated, forming\\nNH3\\n+, which then attracts chromate anions through electro-\\nstatic forces of attraction. Yet, since DETA acts as a tridentate\\nligand, it might introduce more pronounced steric hindrance\\nbetween the ions, subsequently causing a substantial decrease\\nin the adsorption eﬃciency, plummeting to 12% at elevated pH\\nlevels.\\n3.3.3\\nAdsorbate concentration. The adsorptive capabilities\\nof f-NHTs were observed across a range of metal ion concen-\\ntrations, spanning from 10 to 150 ppm, and conducted at a pH\\nof 3 for 30 minutes with 10 mg of f-HNTs. Fig. 7 illustrates the\\nimpact of these metal ion concentrations on the adsorption\\ncapacity for four distinct adsorbents: H1, H2, H3, and H4. The\\nobserved trend indicated that as the concentration of metal ions\\nrose, there was a corresponding decrease in Cr(VI) adsorption\\neﬃciency. All the nano-adsorbents reached their peak adsorp-\\ntion at 10 ppm; beyond this concentration, a decline in\\nadsorption was noted. This diminishing trend could be\\nascribed to the reduced availability of active adsorption sites\\nwith escalating metal concentration.\\n3.3.4\\nComparative sorption of Cr(VI) ions by f-HNTs (H1–\\nH4). Various f-HNTs have shown promise as nano-sorbents due\\nto the presence of oxygen and nitrogen-containing functional\\ngroups on their surface.82,83 The adsorption eﬃciency of Cr(VI)\\nions\\non\\nf-HNTs\\nwas\\nevaluated\\nat\\noptimized\\nconditions\\nincluding a pH of 3, a contact duration of 30 minutes, an\\nadsorbate concentration of 10 ppm using 10 mg of the adsor-\\nbent. The optimal adsorption rates of Cr(VI) ions on various f-\\nHNTs ranged between 58% to 94% as depicted in Fig. 8. This\\nadsorption range is largely in\\ue104uenced by the binding capacities\\nof the various f-HNTs with the Cr(VI) ions owing to the speci\\ue103c\\nfunctional groups intentionally introduced on the surface of\\nHNTs. The mechanism for this adsorption involves the elec-\\ntrostatic interactions and chemical bonding between Cr(VI) ions\\nand the surface groups of f-HNTs. The results reveal that the\\nincreased binding potential of f-HNTs positions them as\\nemerging contenders in the realm of adsorbing nanomaterials.\\nFig. 7\\nEﬀect of adsorbate concentration on the adsorption capacity of\\nf-HNTs (H1–H4).\\nFig. 5\\nEﬀect of contact time on the adsorption capacity of f-HNTs\\n(H1–H4).\\nFig. 6\\nEﬀect of pH on the adsorption capacity of f-HNTs (H1–H4).\\n2954 | RSC Adv., 2024, 14, 2947–2960\\n© 2024 The Author(s).

A comparison of Cr(VI) adsorption capacity with\\nother previous works has been given in Table 1. The table clearly\\nre\\ue104ects that the adsorption capacity of f-HNTs is relatively\\nhigher than other modi\\ue103ed HNTs like HDTMA-HNTs, HNT-PUS\\nand also SWCNTs/MWCNTs. The decorated HNTs showcased\\noutstanding\\nperformance\\nin\\nremoving\\nmaximum\\nCr(VI)\\npollutant in terms of its shorter span of time and relatively\\nbroader range of acidic environment than others.\\n3.3.6\\nAdsorption isotherms. The adsorption process is\\ntypically assessed based on several characteristics of the\\nadsorbent surface, including the type of functional groups it\\ncontains. Commonly recognized mechanisms of adsorption\\nencompass electrostatic attraction, complexation, chelation,\\nand hydrogen bonding. Under acidic conditions, the proton-\\nation of amine groups can be readily initiated, making the\\nadsorption of the Cr(VI) anion through electrostatic interactions\\nhighly plausible. During the adsorption procedure, the solute\\nthat gets adsorbed onto the surface of the adsorbent is in\\na dynamic equilibrium with the solute concentration in the\\nsolution. The solute quantity adsorbed on the adsorbent surface\\n(represented as qe) with respect to the solute quantity at equi-\\nlibrium in the solution (represented as Ce) at a constant\\ntemperature yields an adsorption isotherm, which can be\\nelucidated using speci\\ue103c adsorption models. The well-known\\nFreundlich and Langmuir adsorption models, in particular,\\nwere employed to delineate the interaction between the adsor-\\nbent and the adsorbate.88,89 The data collected from all f-HNTs\\nnano-sorbent systems, designed for the uptake of Cr(VI) ions,\\nwas analyzed using the appropriate isotherms to determine the\\nmost \\ue103tting trend. The information regarding f-NHTs was\\nexamined using parameters from both Freundlich and Lang-\\nmuir adsorption isotherms. As a result, the Langmuir mono-\\nlayer adsorption model was deemed more suitable, suggesting\\nthat f-HNTs oﬀer homogenous donor sites. The nano-sorbents'\\ndiverse active sites eﬀectively adsorb Cr(VI) ions from the\\naqueous solution.

The strength of these bonds is\\nmanifest in the altered atomic distances within the hydrogen\\nbonds. In Fig. 11, the complexes of HCrO4\\n−with H1 and H2 are\\nillustrated, and the bond distances are prominently marked as\\nRi (where i ranges from 1 to 5). Across both complexes, a total of\\nfour hydrogen bonds are formed, yet the bond lengths tend to\\nbe notably shorter in the complex involving H2, suggesting\\na more robust interaction (Table 3).\\nOn the other hand, R2 represents the distance of the O–H\\nbond within the HCrO4\\n−anion. A lengthier R2 denotes a more\\npronounced transfer of the acidic proton toward the HNTs,\\nwhich also implies a more intense interaction.\\nThe H3 and H4 variants are distinguished by the diﬀering\\nlengths of the chains that are attached to the hydrazone moiety.\\nExamining the interactions within these molecular structures, it\\nbecomes apparent that the extended chain lengths in both cases\\nact as a barrier to the establishment of hydrogen bonds with\\nHCrO4\\n−, owing to the relative disposition and presence of\\nintramolecular\\nhydrogen\\nbonds\\namong\\nchains.\\nFig.\\n12\\ndemonstrates that in both scenarios, merely two hydrogen\\nbonds are formed.\\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that the OH group in HCrO4\\n−\\nplays no role in these interactions. Consequently, the interac-\\ntion energies for H3 and H4 are lower, registering at −18.44 and\\n−19.30 kcal mol−1 respectively compared to H1 and H2,\\na \\ue103nding that is consistent with experimental data (Table 4).\\nHowever, despite these results, H4 exhibits a marginally higher\\n(by less than 1 kcal mol−1) interaction energy compared to H3.\\nContrarily, experimental observations indicate that H3 has\\na superior ability to bind with HCrO4\\n−. This discrepancy could\\npotentially be attributed to the inherent limitations of the\\nsimpli\\ue103ed molecular model being employed, suggesting that\\na more accurate representation of the interactions with HCrO4\\n−\\nmight necessitate accounting for the additional chains.\\n4.\\nConclusions\\nThe functionalization of pristine halloysite nanotubes was\\nsuccessfully achieved through the incorporation of various\\nentities, resulting in the creation of four distinct types of\\nfunctionalized halloysite nanotubes (f-HNTs). Techniques such\\nas FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDX were employed to characterize the\\nf-HNTs, con\\ue103rming that the functionalization was successfully\\nimplemented\\non\\ntheir\\nexternal\\nsurfaces.\\nThe\\nconducted\\nadsorption studies demonstrated a signi\\ue103cant dependence of\\nCr(VI) ions adsorption by the f-HNTs on factors including pH\\nlevel, duration of contact, and the concentration of Cr(VI) ions.\\nWhen applied for the adsorption of Cr(VI) ions, the functional-\\nized HNTs showcased an outstanding performance, capturing\\nover 90% within a mere 30 minutes at a pH level of 3 for H1 and\\nH2, while H3 and H4 achieved 66% and 58% adsorption,\\nrespectively. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm model indi-\\ncated a favorable adsorption process, with the RL value ranging\\nbetween 0 and 1. The f-HNTs featured hydroxyl and amine\\ngroups, and the interactions between the Cr(VI) ions and the\\nadsorbents were primarily electrostatic. Further investigation\\nthrough quantum chemical calculations disclosed that halloy-\\nsite nanotubes adorned with hydrazone formations (H2)\\nexhibited\\na\\nstronger\\npropensity\\n(interaction\\nenergy\\n−26.33 kcal mol−1) toward Cr(VI) ions. This phenomenon can be\\nattributed to the generation of more robust hydrogen bonds\\nwith the NH components of the hydrazone segment, surpassing\\nthe bonds formed by the OH group in oxime (H1) and the\\nextended amine chains seen in H3 and H4. Based on these\\n\\ue103ndings, the decorated HNTs present themselves as economi-\\ncally advantageous adsorbents for potential applications in\\nremoving Cr(VI) from polluted water. In future studies, we will\\nfurther investigate the performance of these decorated HNTs on\\nreal wastewater samples to expand their applications.\\nConﬂicts of interest\\nThere are no con\\ue104icts to declare.\\nAcknowledgements\\nSyed Nadeem Ahmad Shah highly appreciates the help and\\nsupport of Dr Jahangeer Ali Patujo and the Polymer lab facilities\\nFig. 12\\nMolecular models for H3–HCrO4\\n−(left) and H4–HCrO4\\n−\\n(right) complexes.
