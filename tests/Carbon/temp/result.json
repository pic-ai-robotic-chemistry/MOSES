        "Abstract": "'a b s t r a c t\\nIn this article, equilibrium CO2 solubility in aqueous 1-(2-Hydroxyethyl) piperidine (HEP) solutions\\npertaining concentrations (1, 2, 3) mol/L in the temperature range (303.15e323.15) K, and CO2 partial\\npressure range 0.1e100 kPa are presented. HEP; being a tertiary alkanolamine, its rate of CO2 absorption\\nis comparatively slower than primary or secondary alkanolamine. Piperazine (PZ), a rate promoter was\\nadded to HEP in 1:4 mol ratio to form blends having enhance rate of CO2 absorption. Equilibrium CO2\\nsolubility in four different aqueous blends; (0.8 mol/L HEP þ 0.2 mol/L PZ), (1.6 mol/L HEP þ 0.4 mol/L\\nPZ), (2.4 mol/L HEP þ 0.6 mol/L PZ), (3.2 mol/L HEP þ 0.8 mol/L PZ) were measured over the temperature\\nrange of (303.15e323.15) K and CO2 partial pressure spanning over 0e70 kPa. Equilibrium constant for\\ndeprotonation reaction of HEP was estimated by measuring pKa of aqueous HEP solution at 298.15,\\n303.15, 313.15, 323.15 and 333.15 K. Experimentally obtained CO2 solubility data for single and blended\\namine solutions were correlated efﬁciently using activity coefﬁcient model with AAD % of 3.76 and 3.22,\\nrespectively. Speciation of both single and blended amine solutions in their equilibrated liquid phase\\nwere predicted. Interaction parameters obtained through thermodynamic modelling of equilibrium\\nsolubility data for single and blended amine solutions were used to predict the enthalpy of CO2\\nabsorption.\\n© 2020 Elsevier B.V.
