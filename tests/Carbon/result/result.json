Activation energies for the two regenera-\\ntion steps are reported in Table II. Figure 3(a) shows the dependence\\nof these activation energies on the solvent dielectric constant. As\\nwe can see, the regeneration of zwitterion from carbamate exhibits\\nhigher activation energies compared to the regeneration of MEA\\nfrom zwitterion. This indicates that the regeneration of zwitterion\\nfrom carbamate is the rate-determining regeneration step regardless\\nof the employed solvent. Going from formamide to THF, we can\\nsee that the activation energy decreases as a function of the solvent\\ndielectric constant.\\nTo confirm the dependence of activation energy on the solvent,\\nin Fig. 3(b), we report the bond order analysis of the NMEA−CCO2\\nbonds in zwitterion and carbamate. This bond order analysis gives\\nus an idea about the relative chemical stabilities of zwitterion and\\ncarbamate. The bond order analysis was carried out using the\\nLöwdin population analysis54 implemented in the ORCA code.33\\nFrom Fig. 3(b), it can be understood that the NMEA−CCO2 bond in\\nzwitterion is covalent in nature and becomes relatively weaker when\\nwe use solvents with a small dielectric constant. The NMEA−CCO2\\nbond in carbamate has values between 1.4 and 1.46, depending on\\nthe employed solvent, which suggests that it is a partially ionic bond.\\nThus, the NMEA−CCO2 bond in carbamate is much stronger than\\nthat in zwitterion, which explains why zwitterion regeneration is the\\nrate-determining step, which is indeed documented in Fig. 3(a).\\nIn the following, we seek to understand how the reduction in\\nregeneration activation energy reported in Table II and Fig. 3(a)\\nwill play out in terms of heat input requirements. Higher activation\\nenergy implies that the solution should be heated at a higher temper-\\nature; thus, molecules will have sufficient energy to cross the energy\\nbarrier. Lowering this temperature will lower the rate at which car-\\nbamate decomposed into amine and CO2. The fact that non-aqueous\\nsolutions with low dielectric constants exhibit lower activation ener-\\ngies means that amines can be regenerated in these solutions at lower\\ntemperatures compared to aqueous solutions, assuming the same\\namine regeneration rate.\\nIn Fig. 4, we report the amine regeneration rate constant as a\\nfunction of temperature for the different solvents. The MEA regen-\\neration reaction rate constants were calculated using the Eyring\\nequation.34 From this figure, the regeneration reaction rate at any\\nregeneration temperature increases by decreasing the solvent dielec-\\ntric constant. This agrees well with the recent experimental results\\nobtained by Bougie et al.8 In this experimental study, it was found\\nthat the amount of desorbed CO2 in the case of the DEGMEE sol-\\nvent (dielectric constant of 12.6) was much higher than in the case\\nof water (dielectric constant of 78.4). Similarly, the amount of des-\\norbed CO2 in the case of water was much higher than in the case\\nof the NMF solvent (dielectric constant of 182.0). Thus, our compu-\\ntational regeneration kinetics results are in line with those obtained\\nexperimentally.8\\nFIG. 4. MEA regeneration reaction rate constant as a function of temperature and\\nsolvent dielectric constant.\\nJ. Chem. Phys. 160, 014501 (2024); doi: 10.1063/5.0169382\\n160, 014501-5\\n© Author(s) 2024\\n 15 October 2024 09:30:19\\nThe Journal\\nof Chemical Physics\\nARTICLE\\npubs.aip.org/aip/jcp\\nTaking into account that typical regeneration temperature in\\nthe case of water is about 140 ○C,2,4–7 we can now estimate from\\nFig. 4 what regeneration temperatures are required for other sol-\\nvents, keeping the same regeneration rate constant. From this figure\\n(see dashed lines), it is possible to achieve MEA regeneration reac-\\ntion at much lower temperatures if we use solvents with low dielec-\\ntric constants. For example, in the case of acetone as a solvent, the\\nregeneration temperature would be as low as 50 ○C, which is much\\nless than the 140 ○C required in the case of water.\\nThe solvent vapor pressure is a very important factor to con-\\nsider when judging the suitability of a certain solvent for carbon\\ncapture applications. Acetone, for example, has a vapor pressure of\\n30.6 kPa at 25 ○C, which is much higher than the vapor pressure\\nof water (3.2 kPa at 25 ○C). From this point of view, acetone might\\nnot be a suitable solvent. Our results show that the required amine\\nregeneration temperatures can be significantly reduced by using\\nnon-aqueous solutions with small dielectric constants. However, it\\nis important to look for a solvent with a small dielectric constant\\nas well as low vapor pressure. One interesting solvent could be\\ndiethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DEGMEE), which has a dielec-\\ntric constant of 12.6, which is very close to t-butanol included in our\\nstudy. DEGMEE has a vapor pressure of 0.02 kPa, which makes it a\\nvery good candidate. This explains why DEGMEE was ranked as the\\nbest solvent in the recent experimental study conducted by Bougie\\net al.8\\nIV. CONCLUSION\\nIn this computational study, we investigated the possibility\\nof using non-aqueous solutions to reduce the energy penalty of\\namine regeneration in amine-based post-combustion carbon cap-\\nture (PCCC) technology. We demonstrated the ability of our com-\\nputational framework to reproduce very well the experimental\\nactivation energy of zwitterion formation. We have shown that non-\\naqueous solutions with small dielectric constants are beneficial for\\nmore energy-efficient amine regeneration. From a thermodynam-\\nics point of view, the change in regeneration enthalpy decreased\\nin the case of these non-aqueous solutions, suggesting less energy\\nconsumption in this case. Also, in this case, the reduction in activa-\\ntion energies will allow for running the desorption columns at much\\nlower temperatures. This could enable us to completely rely on waste\\nthermal energy instead of using expensive high-grade electrical heat\\nenergy. Although these results are very promising, other factors such\\nas the solvent volatility should be also considered.\\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\\nThe supplementary material is available and contains activa-\\ntion energies (Table S1) and Gibbs free energies (Table S2) of the\\ndifferent forward and backward reactions.

The operating variables in this study were temperature\\n(55, 75 and 95 °C), rich solvent ﬂow rate (0.3, 0.9 and 1.5 ml/min), and inlet solvent concentration (10, 20 and\\n30 wt% of the amine). The mass transfer eﬃciency was determined based on the desorption percentage, vo-\\nlumetric liquid-side mass transfer coeﬃcient (kLaV), volumetric overall mass transfer ﬂux (NCO2aV), and energy\\nconsumption per unit mass CO2 (R). The results showed that the use of a microchannel signiﬁcantly increased\\nthe mass transfer rate and decreased energy consumption per removed CO2. The results also showed that the\\namount of kLaV for the two solvents of MEA and DEA was 1.91 and 3.48 1/s, respectively. Moreover, the R-value\\nfor the two solvents of MEA and DEA was 1.3 and 1.63 MJ/kg CO2, respectively, which is at least three times\\nlower than that of other mass transfer devices.'"

We tested a total of six solvent mixtures of water or\\nmethanol with monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, or activated methyl diethanolamine in a broad\\nrange of operational conditions, including temperature (50e100 \\x01C), rich solvent ﬂow rate (0.5e4.5 ml/\\nmin), and amine concentration in the solvent (10 and 50% w/w). CO2 desorption was thoroughly char-\\nacterized with respect to the mass transfer rate and energy consumption, and both were expected to\\nimprove with the use of a microreactor due to short diffusion distances and a larger surface-to-area ratio.\\nAn increase in the operating temperature or concentration of the amine resulted in a higher percentage\\nof desorption and enhanced mass transfer rates, as shown by the local mass transfer coefﬁcient based on\\nthe liquid phase values herein disclosed. Increasing the rich solvent ﬂow rate also increased the local\\nmass transfer coefﬁcient values (80%e95%); however, the overall percentage of CO2 desorption reduced\\n(25%e35%) due to shorter residence times in the microreactor. Similarly, the energetic desorption efﬁ-\\nciency improved for all the solutions with increasing temperature (65e75% reduction) and concentration\\nof amine in the solvent (20e35% reduction), yet again decreasing with an increasing ﬂow rate of rich\\nsolvent (5e15%). Compared to the literature values for the packed columns and microreactors, our data\\nshowed the overall energy consumption up to an 88% reduction in speciﬁc CO2 desorption, demon-\\nstrating great potential for the intensiﬁcation of solvent-mediated, energetically demanding CO2\\ndesorption. In addition, the results showed that the energy consumption for CO2 desorption was reduced\\nby 73% by choosing a non-aqueous in preference to an aqueous alkanolamine solvent.\\n© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

When using hydrazone-modi\\ue103ed HNTs\\n(H2), the adsorption eﬃciency peaked at 94% within 30 minutes\\nat a pH of 3 as shown in Fig. 6. This increased adsorption eﬃ-\\nciency can be attributed to the presence of a greater number of\\namino groups in H2 sample compared to H1. The adsorption\\neﬃciency of EDA-modi\\ue103ed HNTs (H3) was found to be 66%,\\nwhich is notably lower than that of H1 and H2. While the NH2\\ngroups of EDA are protonated similar to H1 and H2, one would\\nexpect ethylenediamine, being a bidentate molecule with\\na chelating nature, to display higher eﬃciency. However, the\\nmolecular hindrance among them potentially impairs the\\nability of EDA to absorb Cr(VI) ions, leading to this diminished\\nadsorption value. On the other hand, sample H4 (DETA-\\nmodi\\ue103ed HNTs) reveals the adsorption eﬃciency of 58%,\\nwhich is even less than H1, H2, and H3 samples. At lower pH\\nlevels, the NH2 groups of DETA become protonated, forming\\nNH3\\n+, which then attracts chromate anions through electro-\\nstatic forces of attraction. Yet, since DETA acts as a tridentate\\nligand, it might introduce more pronounced steric hindrance\\nbetween the ions, subsequently causing a substantial decrease\\nin the adsorption eﬃciency, plummeting to 12% at elevated pH\\nlevels.\\n3.3.3\\nAdsorbate concentration. The adsorptive capabilities\\nof f-NHTs were observed across a range of metal ion concen-\\ntrations, spanning from 10 to 150 ppm, and conducted at a pH\\nof 3 for 30 minutes with 10 mg of f-HNTs. Fig. 7 illustrates the\\nimpact of these metal ion concentrations on the adsorption\\ncapacity for four distinct adsorbents: H1, H2, H3, and H4. The\\nobserved trend indicated that as the concentration of metal ions\\nrose, there was a corresponding decrease in Cr(VI) adsorption\\neﬃciency. All the nano-adsorbents reached their peak adsorp-\\ntion at 10 ppm; beyond this concentration, a decline in\\nadsorption was noted. This diminishing trend could be\\nascribed to the reduced availability of active adsorption sites\\nwith escalating metal concentration.\\n3.3.4\\nComparative sorption of Cr(VI) ions by f-HNTs (H1–\\nH4). Various f-HNTs have shown promise as nano-sorbents due\\nto the presence of oxygen and nitrogen-containing functional\\ngroups on their surface.82,83 The adsorption eﬃciency of Cr(VI)\\nions\\non\\nf-HNTs\\nwas\\nevaluated\\nat\\noptimized\\nconditions\\nincluding a pH of 3, a contact duration of 30 minutes, an\\nadsorbate concentration of 10 ppm using 10 mg of the adsor-\\nbent. The optimal adsorption rates of Cr(VI) ions on various f-\\nHNTs ranged between 58% to 94% as depicted in Fig. 8. This\\nadsorption range is largely in\\ue104uenced by the binding capacities\\nof the various f-HNTs with the Cr(VI) ions owing to the speci\\ue103c\\nfunctional groups intentionally introduced on the surface of\\nHNTs. The mechanism for this adsorption involves the elec-\\ntrostatic interactions and chemical bonding between Cr(VI) ions\\nand the surface groups of f-HNTs.

The adsorption process is\\ntypically assessed based on several characteristics of the\\nadsorbent surface, including the type of functional groups it\\ncontains. Commonly recognized mechanisms of adsorption\\nencompass electrostatic attraction, complexation, chelation,\\nand hydrogen bonding. Under acidic conditions, the proton-\\nation of amine groups can be readily initiated, making the\\nadsorption of the Cr(VI) anion through electrostatic interactions\\nhighly plausible. During the adsorption procedure, the solute\\nthat gets adsorbed onto the surface of the adsorbent is in\\na dynamic equilibrium with the solute concentration in the\\nsolution. The solute quantity adsorbed on the adsorbent surface\\n(represented as qe) with respect to the solute quantity at equi-\\nlibrium in the solution (represented as Ce) at a constant\\ntemperature yields an adsorption isotherm, which can be\\nelucidated using speci\\ue103c adsorption models. The well-known\\nFreundlich and Langmuir adsorption models, in particular,\\nwere employed to delineate the interaction between the adsor-\\nbent and the adsorbate.88,89 The data collected from all f-HNTs\\nnano-sorbent systems, designed for the uptake of Cr(VI) ions,\\nwas analyzed using the appropriate isotherms to determine the\\nmost \\ue103tting trend. The information regarding f-NHTs was\\nexamined using parameters from both Freundlich and Lang-\\nmuir adsorption isotherms. As a result, the Langmuir mono-\\nlayer adsorption model was deemed more suitable, suggesting\\nthat f-HNTs oﬀer homogenous donor sites. The nano-sorbents'\\ndiverse active sites eﬀectively adsorb Cr(VI) ions from the\\naqueous solution. Herein, both correlation factors and equi-\\nlibrium parameters were computed using Freundlich and\\nLangmuir adsorption models, as presented in Table 2. The\\ncorrelation coeﬃcients, R2 values, from these isotherms, indi-\\ncate that the data aligns more accurately with the Langmuir\\nmodel than the Freundlich model as shown in Fig. 9 and 10,\\nrevealing that Cr(VI) adsorption mainly adheres to the Langmuir\\nisotherm.

The strength of these bonds is\\nmanifest in the altered atomic distances within the hydrogen\\nbonds. In Fig. 11, the complexes of HCrO4\\n−with H1 and H2 are\\nillustrated, and the bond distances are prominently marked as\\nRi (where i ranges from 1 to 5). Across both complexes, a total of\\nfour hydrogen bonds are formed, yet the bond lengths tend to\\nbe notably shorter in the complex involving H2, suggesting\\na more robust interaction (Table 3).\\nOn the other hand, R2 represents the distance of the O–H\\nbond within the HCrO4\\n−anion. A lengthier R2 denotes a more\\npronounced transfer of the acidic proton toward the HNTs,\\nwhich also implies a more intense interaction.\\nThe H3 and H4 variants are distinguished by the diﬀering\\nlengths of the chains that are attached to the hydrazone moiety.\\nExamining the interactions within these molecular structures, it\\nbecomes apparent that the extended chain lengths in both cases\\nact as a barrier to the establishment of hydrogen bonds with\\nHCrO4\\n−, owing to the relative disposition and presence of\\nintramolecular\\nhydrogen\\nbonds\\namong\\nchains.\\nFig.\\n12\\ndemonstrates that in both scenarios, merely two hydrogen\\nbonds are formed.\\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that the OH group in HCrO4\\n−\\nplays no role in these interactions. Consequently, the interac-\\ntion energies for H3 and H4 are lower, registering at −18.44 and\\n−19.30 kcal mol−1 respectively compared to H1 and H2,\\na \\ue103nding that is consistent with experimental data (Table 4).\\nHowever, despite these results, H4 exhibits a marginally higher\\n(by less than 1 kcal mol−1) interaction energy compared to H3.\\nContrarily, experimental observations indicate that H3 has\\na superior ability to bind with HCrO4\\n−. This discrepancy could\\npotentially be attributed to the inherent limitations of the\\nsimpli\\ue103ed molecular model being employed, suggesting that\\na more accurate representation of the interactions with HCrO4\\n−\\nmight necessitate accounting for the additional chains.\\n4.\\nConclusions\\nThe functionalization of pristine halloysite nanotubes was\\nsuccessfully achieved through the incorporation of various\\nentities, resulting in the creation of four distinct types of\\nfunctionalized halloysite nanotubes (f-HNTs). Techniques such\\nas FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDX were employed to characterize the\\nf-HNTs, con\\ue103rming that the functionalization was successfully\\nimplemented\\non\\ntheir\\nexternal\\nsurfaces.\\nThe\\nconducted\\nadsorption studies demonstrated a signi\\ue103cant dependence of\\nCr(VI) ions adsorption by the f-HNTs on factors including pH\\nlevel, duration of contact, and the concentration of Cr(VI) ions.\\nWhen applied for the adsorption of Cr(VI) ions, the functional-\\nized HNTs showcased an outstanding performance, capturing\\nover 90% within a mere 30 minutes at a pH level of 3 for H1 and\\nH2, while H3 and H4 achieved 66% and 58% adsorption,\\nrespectively. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm model indi-\\ncated a favorable adsorption process, with the RL value ranging\\nbetween 0 and 1. The f-HNTs featured hydroxyl and amine\\ngroups, and the interactions between the Cr(VI) ions and the\\nadsorbents were primarily electrostatic. Further investigation\\nthrough quantum chemical calculations disclosed that halloy-\\nsite nanotubes adorned with hydrazone formations (H2)\\nexhibited\\na\\nstronger\\npropensity\\n(interaction\\nenergy\\n−26.33 kcal mol−1) toward Cr(VI) ions. This phenomenon can be\\nattributed to the generation of more robust hydrogen bonds\\nwith the NH components of the hydrazone segment, surpassing\\nthe bonds formed by the OH group in oxime (H1) and the\\nextended amine chains seen in H3 and H4. Based on these\\n\\ue103ndings, the decorated HNTs present themselves as economi-\\ncally advantageous adsorbents for potential applications in\\nremoving Cr(VI) from polluted water. In future studies, we will\\nfurther investigate the performance of these decorated HNTs on\\nreal wastewater samples to expand their applications.\\nConﬂicts of interest\\nThere are no con\\ue104icts to declare.\\nAcknowledgements\\nSyed Nadeem Ahmad Shah highly appreciates the help and\\nsupport of Dr Jahangeer Ali Patujo and the Polymer lab facilities\\nFig. 12\\nMolecular models for H3–HCrO4\\n−(left) and H4–HCrO4\\n−\\n(right) complexes.

        "Title": "'Design of Nanostraws in Amine-Functionalized MCM-41 for\\nImproved Adsorption Capacity in Carbon Capture\\n'",
        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: Polymeric amine encapsulation in high surface area\\nMCM-41 particles for CO2 capture is well established but has the\\ndrawback of leaching out the water-soluble polymer upon exposure\\nto aqueous environments. Alternatively, chemical (covalent) grafting\\namine functional groups from an alkoxysilane such as 3-\\naminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) on MCM-41 offer better\\nstability against this drawback. However, the diffusional restriction\\nexhibited by the narrow uniform MCM-41 pores (2−4 nm) may\\nimpede amine functionalization of the available silanol groups within\\nthe inner mesoporous core. This leads to incomplete amine\\nfunctionalization and could reduce the CO2 adsorption capacity in\\nsuch materials. Our concept to improve access to the MCM-41\\ninterior is based on the incorporation of nanostraws with larger inner\\ndiameter (15−30 nm) to create a hierarchical porosity and enhance the molecular transport of APTES. Halloysite nanotubes\\n(HNT) are used as tubular straws that are integrated into the MCM-41 matrix using an aerosol-assisted synthesis method.\\nCharacterization results show that the intrinsic structure of MCM-41 remains unaltered after the incorporation of the nanostraws\\nand amine functionalization. At an optimal APTES loading of 0.5 g (X = 2.0), the amine-functionalized composite of MCM-41 with\\nstraws (APTES/M40H) has a 20% higher adsorption capacity than the amine-modified MCM-41 (APTES/MCM-41) adsorbent.\\nFurthermore, the CO2 adsorption capacity APTES/M40H doubles that of APTES/MCM-41 when normalized based on the\\ncomposition of MCM-41 in the composite particle with straws. The facile integration of nanostraws in MCM-41 leading to\\nhierarchical porosities could be effective toward the mitigation of diffusional restriction in porous materials with potential for other\\ncatalytic and adsorption technologies.'"

        "Title": "'Post-combustion CO2 capture and recovery by pure activated\\nmethyldiethanolamine in crossflow membrane contactors having coated\\nhollow fibers\\n'",
        "Abstract": "'A B S T R A C T\\nGas absorption and stripping using membrane contactors is one of a number of carbon capture and storage\\ntechnologies being investigated for separating CO2 from flue gas. Energy consumption in CO2 absorption-\\nstripping employing amine-containing aqueous absorbent solutions is strongly influenced by demanding strip-\\nping conditions involving higher temperatures. The utility of using pure methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) acti-\\nvated by piperazine as a reactive absorbent was studied using a compact hollow fiber device for the absorber as\\nwell as the stripper. Water needed for reactive absorption of CO2 in tertiary amine MDEA was obtained from\\nsimulated humidified flue gas stream which is saturated with moisture in actual practice. This study investigated\\nalso the absorption and stripping performances of aqueous absorbent solutions containing 80% and 90% acti-\\nvated MDEA (aMDEA). Considerable CO2 stripping from CO2-loaded pure aMDEA absorbent was achieved at\\n92 °C while absorption was carried out at 25–46 °C.

The \\nmost widely used and studied solvent for this purpose is 30% Monoethanolamine (MEA). The main \\nissue with the process is the use of energy for stripping CO2 out of the solvent. It is anticipated that \\nhigher concentrations of MEA can capture a higher amount of CO2 and thus reduce energy \\nconsumption but may also result in a worsening of the environmental emissions due to potential \\nincrease in corrosion and solvent degradation.  \\nIn order to study the impact of 40% MEA (as opposed to 30% MEA) on the capture plant \\nperformance, a test campaign was carried out at the Pilot Scale Advanced Capture Technology \\n(PACT) facilities of the UK Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre (UKCCSRC) using 30% \\nand 40% MEA. The absorber (9 m height x 0.3 m dia.) is packed with 28 sections (6.5 m) of Mellapak \\nCC3 structured packing. The absorption column temperature profile is measured by 10 RTDs \\ninstalled around 48 cm apart along the column length. The performance of the capture plant in terms \\nof reboiler duty, capture efficiency, loading capacity and liquid to gas ratio is evaluated at different \\noperating conditions.  \\nIt has been found that specific reboiler duty using 40% MEA drops by up to 14% as compared \\nto that with 30% MEA under similar test conditions.

Moreover, similar energy and capture performance can be achieved \\nat different reboiler temperatures with right combination of temperature and pressure in the \\nreboiler/stripper.

Compared to the bulk liquid, the encapsulated liquid\\nshows improved thermal stability over cycles of absorption at 25 °C, and desorption at 75\\n°C. The capsules with core of [BMIM][BF4]-MEA show 0.2 mol CO2/kg of capsules at 1\\nbar CO2, compared to the bulk liquid, which has 0.05 mol CO2/kg of sorbent.

Cross-association interactions between the \\nhydroxyl and amine groups were allowed in the model, with the cross- \\nassociation parameters directly predicted from mixing rules in Eq. (3). \\nThe examined physical co-solvents include water (forming conven\\xad\\ntional aqueous amines), and polar aprotic solvents, namely, N-methyl-2- \\npyrrolidone (NMP), and sulfolane (SFL) (forming water-free hybrid \\nsolvents). Water was modeled as an associating LJ sphere (m = 1) with \\nfour association sites, two sites for the two hydrogen atoms, and two \\nsites for the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom [57]. Conversely, \\naprotic dipolar fluids such as NMP,[58] and SFL, were explicitly \\nmodeled as dipolar fluids, accounting for their experimental dipole, and \\nfixing their dipolar segments a priori based on the physical argument \\npresented in previous contributions [49]. \\nThe molecular parameters for all studied pure fluids, except for SFL, \\nwere transferred from earlier contributions [51,53–55,57,58], while \\nthose for SFL were developed in this work using pure fluid saturated \\nliquid density and vapor pressure, and are included in Table S1 in the \\nSupporting Information (SI) for completeness. Additionally, FVT pa\\xad\\nrameters for viscosity computations are included in Table S2 in the SI, \\nwith those for NMP and SFL developed in this work. The performance of \\npolar soft-SAFT in characterizing the pure fluid behavior for SFL, and the \\nviscosity of NMP and SFL using FVT treatment are shown in Figure S1 in \\nthe SI. \\nNotwithstanding, the most critical element in describing the chem\\xad\\nisorption of acid gases in amine-based solvents using a molecular-based \\nEoSs, is the development of a simplified modeling approach that \\nimplicitly transitions the chemical reactivity of amines towards acid \\ngases to a physical-based model, such as polar soft-SAFT. This modeling \\napproach has been successfully developed in our previous works for \\nmodeling the solubility of single and mixed acid gases (CO2 and H2S) in \\naqueous amines [35,36,55], and CO2 absorption in water-free hybrid \\nsolvents using soft-SAFT EoS [37,38]. \\nThe application of this approach depends on understanding the main \\nchemical reactions in acid gas absorption. It is generally accepted that \\nthe reaction mechanisms governing the absorption of CO2 in primary \\nand secondary amines, such as MEA and DEA, respectively, undergoes \\nthe formation of carbamate (R1R2NCOO−) with a stochiometric ratio of \\nFig. 3.

These reaction mechanisms are \\napplicable irrespective of the co-solvent utilized, being aqueous or non- \\naqueous systems [66–70]. However, the co-solvent plays a major role in \\nthe progression of the reaction and stabilization of the resulting reaction \\nproduct [71]. Mediating the formation of these reaction products using a \\nphysical based model such as polar soft-SAFT is implicitly mimicked \\nthrough the formation of [acid gas-amine] molecular agglomerates \\nconnected through strong and highly directional association in\\xad\\nteractions, as shown in Fig. 3. This is done through adding specific as\\xad\\nsociation “reactive” sites in the acid gas molecule capable of only \\nforming strong localized intermolecular interactions with the lone pair \\nof electrons in the nitrogen atom in the amines, emulating the formation \\nof the reaction product [35,37,38,55]. The number of association \\n“reactive” sites depends on the reaction stoichiometry of the acid gas \\nwith the primary and secondary amines examined in this work, as such \\ntwo sites, α1 and α2, were added on CO2 for the formation of carbamate, \\nwhile one site, α1, was added on H2S for the formation of bisulfide. The \\nadded reaction sites are characterized by cross-association parameters, \\nwith the cross-association volume fixed to a value representative of well- \\nlocalized short-range interactions (i.e., κHB\\nN−αi = 500 ˙A3) [35,55], while \\nthe cross-association energy for each reactive site was fitted to available \\ndata for the solubility of acid gas in the examined amine solvents. This \\napproach is used to model acid gas solubilities in solvents including \\naqueous MEA and aqueous DEA, along with hybrid solvents of MEA, or \\nDEA chemical solvents mixed with NMP or SFL physical co-solvents. \\n2.4. Multi-criteria solvent evaluation framework \\nThe implemented multi-criteria assessment accounts on solvent \\nproperties reflective of their potentiality for acid gas removal. These \\ncriteria are divided into three categories: (1) relevant solvent physico- \\nchemical properties, (2) standard key performance indicators, and (3) \\nsustainability metrics, and are applied to the hybrid solvents and their \\naqueous equivalents. The breakdown for each category, and assessment \\nmethods are summarized in Table 1. \\n2.4.1. Relevant solvent thermophysical and transport properties \\nIn this category, a large set of properties of the solvents are included, \\nwhich are obtained from polar soft-SAFT predictions at relevant condi\\xad\\ntions, once the models have been validated with available experimental \\ndata. For the investigated solvents (chemical solvent + physical co- \\nsolvent), the density and viscosity are of critical importance. The den\\xad\\nsity of the solvent affects the sizing of the equipment within the process, \\nsolvent circulation rate, and pumping requirements, and should be \\nmaximized to reduce these processing aspects, and consequently, \\ndecrease the CAPEX and OPEX of the process. Alternatively, the vis\\xad\\ncosity of the solvent affects the mass transfer within the absorption \\ncolumn and the energy requirements for pumping, and should be \\nminimized to reduce the associated CAPEX and OPEX of the process \\n[44], respectively. \\nHeat of vaporization and heat capacity are two relevant properties \\nfor both chemical solvent and physical co-solvent. The heat of vapor\\xad\\nization is one of the components affecting the total energy of regener\\xad\\nation, and is related to the amount of energy required to vaporize the \\nphysical co-solvent and provide required driving force within the \\nregeneration column. Similarly, heat capacity contributes to the total \\nregeneration energy, and affects the amount of energy required to in\\xad\\ncrease the temperature of the solvent to that of the reboiler. Both \\nproperties should be minimized to reduce the total regeneration energy \\nand consequently the OPEX of the process [72]. \\n2.4.2. Standard key performance indicators \\nThis category includes acid gas cyclic capacity, CO2 ideal selectivity, \\nand solvent regeneration energy. The cyclic capacity (ΔαAG) is defined \\nas the amount of acid gas effectively removed from the feed gas stream, \\nwhich has direct implications on all technical and economic aspects of \\nthe absorption process. The cyclic capacity for each acid gas is computed \\nas the difference between the acid gas loading at absorption conditions \\n(rich), and the acid gas loading at desorption conditions (lean) [76], as: \\nΔαAG(T, P) = αAG,Rich(T, P)abs −αAG,Lean(T, P)des\\n(6) \\nThe cyclic capacity is inclusive of the acid gas absorption/desorption \\nloadings (αAG), which signifies the amount of acid gas (CO2 or H2S) in \\nthe solvent at absorption/desorption conditions, typically reported on \\nthe basis of moles of absorbed acid gas per mole amine, which is ob\\xad\\ntained using polar soft-SAFT predictions at representative absorption \\nconditions. \\nConversely, CO2 ideal selectivity (SCO2) measures the maximum af\\xad\\nfinity of the solvent towards absorbing CO2 rather than H2S, which in\\xad\\nfluences the design of the absorption column and required solvent \\nregeneration energy. The CO2 ideal selectivity, on the basis of moles of \\nabsorbed CO2 per moles of absorbed H2S, can be computed from polar \\nsoft-SAFT predicted acid gas loading at particular absorption conditions, \\nas follows: \\nSCO2(T, P) = αCO2(T, P)abs\\nαH2S(T, P)abs\\n(7) \\nLastly, solvent regeneration energy (Qreg) is typically the focal point \\nof solvent assessment which should be minimized due to its massive \\neffect on the OPEX of the process. It is typically reported on the basis of \\nMJ per ton of acid gas captured, and it is effectively related to the total \\namount of energy needed to remove the absorbed acid gas in the rich \\nsolvent, bringing it back to lean conditions, written as [77–79]: \\nQreg = Qvap + Qsen + Qabs\\n(8) \\nwhere, Qvap, is the latent energy required to vaporize the physical co- \\nsolvent which depends on the physical co-solvent enthalpy of vapor\\xad\\nization, Qsen, is the sensible energy required to increase the temperature \\nof the solvent to that of the reboiler which depends on the heat capac\\xad\\nities of the chemical solvent and physical co-solvents, while Qabs, is the \\nenergy needed to reverse the absorption reaction and liberate the \\nabsorbed acid gas from the rich solvent which depends on the enthalpy \\nof absorption.

[72], in a manner consistent with our \\nprevious contributions [35,37,38]. The reader is referred to the original \\npaper for additional details on the implementation of this method [72]. \\nPreferred solvents are those with high cyclic capacity and CO2 ideal \\nselectivity, and low solvent regeneration energy due to their impact on \\nincreasing the efficiency of the process and reducing associated CAPEX \\nand OPEX [72]. \\nAs previously highlighted, all required information to compute these \\ncriteria (using Eqs. (6) – (9)) are obtained directly from polar soft-SAFT \\npredictions for the examined solvents (aqueous MEA/DEA, NMP +\\nMEA/DEA, and SFL + MEA/DEA) once the developed models are vali\\xad\\ndated with experimental data. Additionally, these criteria are affected \\nby the choice of operating conditions of the absorption process such as, \\nconcentration of CO2 and H2S in the raw feed gas, absorber/reboiler \\ntemperatures, and absorber/ stripper operating pressures. It was \\nassumed that the feed gas had equimolar composition of both acid gases \\n(PCO2 = PH2S), with their individual partial pressures changing in the \\nrange of 10 – 50 kPa, to examine the acid gas absorption capabilities of \\nthese solvents at conditions representative of different feed gas sources. \\nThe absorber temperature was fixed to Tabs = 313 K, while the absorber \\noperating pressure was fixed to Pabs = 100 kPa. Conversely, the stripper \\nwas assumed to operate at a total pressure of 200 kPa, while the reboiler \\ntemperature in the stripper was allowed to change depending on the \\ndesorption temperature for each acid gas solubility in each solvent \\nrequired to obtain 50% reduction in rich loading, and as such the cyclic \\ncapacity can be obtained as ΔαAG = 0.5αAG,Rich, consistent with our \\nprevious works [35,37]. It should be noted that for the purpose of this \\nwork, the chosen conditions were those mimicking post-combustion \\ncapture, however, the approach developed in this work has sufficient \\nflexibility to examine other conditions such as those encountered for \\nnatural gas processing, biogas upgrading, and syngas separation. \\n2.4.3. Sustainability assessment criteria \\nThe inclusion of sustainability-related assessment criteria is usually \\noverlooked, but highly needed as it provides insights on the associated \\nenvironmental burdens with solvent production, along with required \\nsafety measures to ensure safe operation and handling of the utilized \\nsolvent [30,47,48]. In this work, the sustainability metrics included in \\nthe solvent assessment are divided into health and safety (HS) hazard \\nassessment, and a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) on the cu\\xad\\nmulative environmental impact of solvent production. \\nThe HS index represents the collective health hazards due to long- \\nterm effects on personnel, and safety hazards from accidental material \\nor energy release. In the safety category, the properties include mobility, \\nfire and explosion, and reaction/decomposition. In the health category, \\nproperties include acute toxicity, irritation, and chronic toxicity effects. \\nThe quantification of the associated HS indices was performed based on \\nthe methodology of Koller et al.,[73] wherein a list of physical and \\nchemical properties of the substances are used to estimate a compre\\xad\\nhensive list of dangerous properties for each hazard category. \\nAs mentioned, the LCA metrics included in this work are based on a \\ncradle-to-gate life cycle for the production of the solvents, from \\nextraction of raw material till solvent delivery to the process gate, \\nexcluding impact associated with the operation of the absorption pro\\xad\\ncess and any associated wastes. The chosen LCA metrics include the \\ncumulative energy demand (CED), the global warming potential (GWP), \\nand the Eco-indicator 99 (EI-99). CED is a resource-oriented indicator \\nreflecting the total primary energy demand during the solvent produc\\xad\\ntion cycle. GWP quantifies the effect of greenhouse gas emissions, \\nconsidered here for a period of 100 years. Lastly, EI-99 provides an \\naggregated score for the end-point impact categories of human health, \\necosystem quality and resource consumption. These metrics were ob\\xad\\ntained directly from the FineChem tool [74,75], using molecular de\\xad\\nscriptors for each pure substance in the examined hybrid solvents. It \\nshould be noted that a more detailed assessment is needed; however, this \\nis too extensive for the purpose of an initial solvent assessment, and \\nhence, it is out of the scope of this work. \\n3. Results and discussions \\n3.1. Polar soft-SAFT thermodynamic modeling for acid gas removal using \\nhybrid solvents \\nAs previously highlighted, polar soft-SAFT is the main element in \\nobtaining the relevant thermodynamic properties to assess the potenti\\xad\\nality of the examined hybrid solvents. Prior to using the model for the \\nintended assessment, its accuracy and robustness has to be systemati\\xad\\ncally validated with available experimental data from pure fluids (as \\nalready presented in Section 2.3), relevant binary mixtures, and finally, \\nabsorption of acid gases in the examined hybrid solvents. \\n3.1.1. Acid gas + physical co-solvent binary mixtures \\nThe modeling accuracy of polar soft-SAFT in capturing the solubility \\nof CO2 and H2S in pure physical co-solvents, NMP and SFL, was first \\nexamined and relevant results are presented here. This is needed to build \\nthe thermodynamic model for acid gas absorption in the investigated \\nhybrid solvents formulated from the addition of these physical co- \\nsolvents. The highest modeling accuracy, with an average absolute de\\xad\\nviation (AAD) of 1.5%, was obtained using a temperature independent \\nbinary energy interaction parameter, ξ (Eq. (2b)), for each binary \\nmixture regressed to experimental data [80] at an intermediate \\nisotherm, T = 323 K, and transferred to other isotherms, as shown in \\nFig. 4. The values for binary energy interaction parameters describing \\nsolubility of CO2 in NMP and SFL were very close to unity indicating the \\nability of the model to accurately capture the molecular interactions \\ngoverning acid gas physical solubility in these solvents. NMP is generally \\na better physical solvent than SFL due to its higher CO2 and H2S solu\\xad\\nbilities at similar conditions. Binary interaction parameters needed to \\ndescribe the solubility of these acid gases in water co-solvent, for the \\nformulation of aqueous amines, were transferred from previous works \\n[35,36]. All binary interaction parameters for CO2 and H2S solubility in \\nthe examined physical co-solvents (NMP, SFL, and water) are included \\nin Table S3 in the SI. \\n3.1.2. Chemical solvent + physical co-solvent binary mixtures \\nThe thermodynamic behavior of the binary mixtures of the studied \\nhybrid solvents MEA + NMP, MEA + SFL, DEA + NMP, and DEA + SFL \\nwas performed using the polar soft-SAFT approach and results are pre\\xad\\nsented in the SI, where the modeling approach for the crossed in\\xad\\nteractions is also explained (see Figure S2 and associated comments in \\nthe SI). For the case of MEA + NMP, the highest modeling accuracy was \\nobtained when the cross-association between NMP’s carbonyl group \\nwith the hydrogen bond donor sites in either ethanol or MEA were \\naccounted for in the model, with AADs of 1.2% and 0.9% for NMP +\\nethanol [83], and NMP + MEA [81], respectively, modeled with the \\nsame transferable cross-association energy correction factor of αHB\\nij \\n=\\n1.075 (see Eq. (3b)). The same approach was employed for binary \\nmixture of NMP with DEA, using the cross-association parameters be\\xad\\ntween NMP’s carbonyl group and DEA’s secondary group transferred \\nfrom diethylamine [51]. \\nIn the case of binary mixtures of MEA or DEA with SFL, due to the \\nI.I.I. Alkhatib et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\nSeparation and Purification Technology 277 (2021) 119516\\n8\\nsteric hindrance of SFL, each SFL carbonyl group was modeled with one \\nassociation site. Employing the same approach, cross association be\\xad\\ntween SFL’s carbonyl groups with the amine groups from MEA and DEA \\nwere transferred from ethylamine and diethylamine, respectively. \\nConversely, cross-association between SFL’s carbonyl groups and the \\nhydroxyl groups of MEA and DEA were transferred from those fitted for \\nbinary mixtures of SFL + ethanol with a cross-association energy \\ncorrection factor,αHB\\nij = 1.045, fitted to experimental VLE data [81], in a \\nmanner consistent with that for NMP + ethanol. The VLE behavior of \\nSFL + ethanol binary mixture is included in Figure S3 in the SI, along \\nwith cross-association parameters for chemical + physical co-solvents \\nprovided in Table S4 in the SI, with those for aqueous amines trans\\xad\\nferred from earlier works [51,55]. \\nWith the cross-association interactions developed for the examined \\nhybrid solvents, polar soft-SAFT was used to estimate other thermody\\xad\\nnamic properties such as molar liquid density and viscosity, highlighted \\nin Fig. 5. The quantitative agreement between predictions from the \\nmodel and experimental data [82], with an AAD of 2.5% for all mixtures, \\nfor both properties further attest the accuracy of the model in evaluating \\nthe thermodynamic behavior of the investigated systems. \\n3.1.3. CO2 absorption in hybrid solvents \\nModeling the chemisorption of CO2 in the examined hybrid solvents \\nwas done based on the modeling framework from our previous contri\\xad\\nbutions [35–38,55] as explained in Section 2.4. The most feasible \\napproach, consistent with previous works [35,37], was regressing \\nasymmetrical \\ncross-association \\nenergies \\nfor \\nboth \\nsites \\n(εHB\\nN−α1/kB ∕= εHB\\nN−α2/kB) to available CO2 solubility isotherms in the \\nstudied solvents, with the energy for one site fixed to a constant value, \\nwhile the energy for the other site was allowed to change as a function of \\ntemperature. The optimized cross-association energy parameters for N- \\nαi interactions for the hybrid solvents, along with those for aqueous \\namines transferred from earlier contribution [35], are provided in \\nTable S5 in the SI. \\nHighlighted in Fig. 6 are polar soft-SAFT calculations for the solu\\xad\\nbility of CO2 in hybrid solvents of MEA or DEA as chemical solvents, \\nwith NMP or SFL as physical co-solvents, for 30 wt% amine, and DEA +\\nSFL with 50 wt% DEA (Fig. 6d), depending on the available experi\\xad\\nmental data. The model computations were consistently capable of \\ncapturing the shape of the CO2 solubility isotherm exhibited by the \\nexperimental data for each hybrid solvent [83–86]. It should be noted \\nthat for MEA-based hybrid mixtures, a loss of modeling accuracy was \\nFig. 4.

H2S absorption in hybrid solvents \\nThe chemisorption of H2S in the examined hybrid solvents was done \\nemploying the same modeling approach provided in Section 2.4. The \\ncross-association energies for the single reactive sites governing H2S \\nchemisorption in MEA + NMP and DEA + NMP hybrid solvents were \\noptimized to available experimental H2S solubility isotherms in these \\nsolvents [85–87], as provided in Table S6 in the SI. In the case of SFL- \\nbased hybrid solvents, an additional site was added to H2S to model its \\nsolubility in these hybrid solvents, requiring two symmetrical temper\\xad\\nature dependent sites (εHB\\nN−α1/kB = εHB\\nN−α2/kB) for H2S chemisorption in \\nMEA + SFL, while two asymmetrical sites (εHB\\nN−α1/kB ∕= εHB\\nN−α2/kB) were \\nneeded to model H2S solubility in DEA + SFL, also included in Table S6 \\nin the SI. Provided in Fig. 7 is the comparison between experimental \\ndata [85–87] and polar soft-SAFT calculations for H2S solubility in the \\nexamined hybrid solvents at different temperatures as a function of H2S \\nmolar composition, in excellent agreement with each other, attesting the \\naccuracy of the modeling approach. It should be noted that all examined \\nhybrid solvents were at an amine concentration of 30 wt%, except for \\nMEA + NMP, which was at 15 wt% MEA, depending on the availability \\nof experimental data. Additionally, it was previously shown that the \\ntransferability of these parameters was still preserved if the amine \\nconcentration is within acceptable limits, ± 15 wt% of the concentration \\nused in parameter optimization [36]. The prime advantage of molecular- \\nbased models is that they offer sufficient flexibility to predict the \\nbehavior of these solvents at conditions not included in the fitting, \\nfacilitating assessing the performance of these solvents at conditions of \\nindustrial relevance. \\n3.2. Multi-criteria assessment of hybrid solvents for acid gas removal \\nAfter developing and validating the polar soft-SAFT thermodynamic \\nmodels for the concerned hybrid solvents using available experimental \\ndata, the solvents were assessed based on the multi-criteria approach \\nexplained in Section 2.4 and Table 1. The solvents are ranked based on \\ntheir performance in a stepwise assessment separately for each category. \\nSubsequently, the ranking from each category is examined to determine \\nthe overall potentiality of hybrid solvents compared to their aqueous \\ncounterparts for acid gas removal. \\nFig. 5. a) Liquid density of MEA + NMP (black) and DEA + NMP (red) hybrid solvents, b) liquid density of MEA + SFL (black) and SFL + DEA (red) hybrid solvents, \\nc) viscosity of NMP-hybrid solvents, and d) viscosity of SFL-hybrid solvents.

Assessment based on relevant solvent properties \\nThe first criteria category, namely, relevant physico-chemical prop\\xad\\nerties of the examined solvents, includes solvent density and viscosity, \\nalong with heat capacity and enthalpy of vaporization of chemical sol\\xad\\nvents and physical co-solvents. Once the robustness of the polar soft- \\nSAFT performance was assessed (see Figs. 4-7), the model was used to \\npredict these properties at typical processing conditions, for the \\ndifferent solvents with 30 wt% amine. \\nThe trends for the mass liquid density and viscosity of the hybrid \\nsolvents at 30 wt% amine, shown in Fig. 8a and 8b, are consistent with \\nthe type of chemical solvents and physical co-solvents. In terms of \\nchemical solvents, DEA-based solvents had higher liquid density and \\nviscosity compared to MEA-based solvents. In terms of physical co- \\nsolvents, the descending order for both properties depends on the \\nphysical co-solvent, as SFL > NMP > H2O. The trade-off between both \\nproperties is directly observed, that solvents with higher mass liquid \\ndensity tend to have higher viscosity. The work of Mota-Martinez et al. \\n[44] highlighted the significant contribution of solvent viscosity (from \\nsensitivity analysis for properties of 30 wt% aqueous MEA) to the overall \\neconomics of the absorption process, being of higher order of impor\\xad\\ntance compared to liquid density. As such, the observed increase in \\nliquid density for hybrid solvents over their aqueous benchmarks will \\nhave a marginal effect on reducing the CAPEX of the process (roughly \\n5% reduction). Conversely, the large increase in viscosity for hybrid \\nsolvents will have a larger contribution to the CAPEX of the process with \\nCAPEX increasing at least by 20%. Per se, judging solely based on sol\\xad\\nvent viscosities, aqueous amines had the lowest viscosities, promising \\nmore efficient mass transfer among the solvents studied here, which \\ntranslates to lower CAPEX associated with the height of the absorption \\ncolumn, and lower OPEX due to less energy requirements for solvent \\npumping. \\nThe solvent thermal properties, i.e., heat capacity and enthalpy of \\nvaporization, depicted in Fig. 8c and 8d, reveal that among both \\nchemical solvents, DEA has lower heat capacity and enthalpy of \\nvaporization than MEA. Similarly, for physical co-solvents, the benefit of \\nusing alternative organic diluents is clearly asserted with NMP and SFL \\nhaving more than 80% lower heat capacity, and more than 60% lower \\nenthalpy of vaporization, as compared to water. This clearly demon\\xad\\nstrates the potential of water-free hybrid solvents in reducing solvent \\nregeneration energy, due to the lower thermal properties of alternative \\nphysical co-solvents. This reduction should be manifested in the sensible \\nand latent energy components of the solvent regeneration energy (Eq. \\n(8)), with expected reductions in OPEX. \\nProvided in Fig. 9 is a comparative ranking of the four solvent \\nproperties highlighted earlier, with the ranking obtained based on polar \\nsoft-SAFT predicted properties at T = 313 as shown in Fig. 8.

Conversely, hybrid \\nsolvents using NMP or SFL as co-solvents are more beneficial in terms of \\nlower thermal properties, and higher densities. Considering these \\ndiverging tendencies, the best compromise for solvent properties would \\nbe with NMP-based hybrid solvents, as they promise significant reduc\\xad\\ntion in solvent regeneration energy due to the reduced thermal prop\\xad\\nerties of the co-solvent, albeit on the expense of increased solvent \\nviscosity (double that of aqueous amines) which could potentially in\\xad\\ncrease the CAPEX of the process by 20%. This is still better than \\nemploying SFL as a physical co-solvent, as it increases the viscosity of \\nthe solvent almost 4 times higher than its aqueous equivalent, which \\ncould potentially result in doubling the capital cost of the absorption \\nprocess [44] and making it unpractical from the operational point of \\nview. Notwithstanding, these general properties are often overlooked \\nfrom the selection of solvents for acid gas removal, particularly, solvent \\nviscosities, but still remain indecisive, on their own, to determine an \\noptimal solvent for such an application. \\n3.2.2. Assessment based on standard key performance indicators \\nAs previously highlighted, the criteria in this category include acid \\ngas cyclic capacity, CO2 ideal selectivity, and solvent regeneration en\\xad\\nergy, which are typical metrics to evaluate the potential of solvents. The \\nmost promising solvent is the one with high acid gas cyclic capacity, \\nhigh CO2 ideal selectivity, and low solvent regeneration energy. All \\nrequired properties to evaluate these criteria were predicted directly \\nfrom polar soft-SAFT under the same conditions, along with using \\nthermodynamic relations from Eqs. (6) – (9). \\nPolar soft-SAFT was used to predict CO2 and H2S absorption capacity \\nin the selected solvents (aqueous and hybrid) as a function of acid gas \\npartial pressure were done at T = 313 K, and 30 wt% amine, as shown in \\nFig. 10. As inferred from the figure, irrespective of the absorbed acid gas, \\nhybrid solvents have a higher absorption capacity than their aqueous \\ncounterparts at high acid gas partial pressures greater than 100 kPa, \\nhinting at their aptness for high pressure absorption rather than low \\npressure, similar to those encountered in pre-combustion capture, or \\nnatural gas sweetening. Conversely, aqueous amines are more effective \\nfor low pressure absorption, such as that encountered for post- \\ncombustion capture. Under the imposed acid gas partial pressures (see \\nSection 2.4.2), in the range of 10 – 50 kPa, CO2 absorption, irrespective \\nFig. 7.

(7) from polar soft-SAFT \\npredicted absorption isotherms shown in Fig. 10. As mentioned in \\nSection 2.4.2, the feed gas was assumed to have equimolar composition \\nof both CO2 and H2S, with their individual partial pressure varying in the \\nrange of 10 – 50 kPa, with an absorber total pressure of 100 kPa. Of \\ncourse, this is one particular condition, and the results obtained herein \\ncan be different depending on the imposed absorption conditions, \\nhowever, this is done to showcase the capabilities of the predictive \\nthermodynamic model in obtaining such information for the assessment \\nof solvents for acid gas removal. Additionally, the CO2 selectivity can be \\nlower than the ones reported herein in the case of examining mixed acid \\ngas absorption. It can be seen that for MEA-based solvents, shown in \\nFig. 11a, the CO2 ideal selectivity is below 1.0, which indicates that \\nthese solvents have a slightly higher affinity towards H2S than CO2 ab\\xad\\nsorption. Increasing acid gas partial pressures, has a higher impact on \\nreducing the CO2 ideal selectivity in the case of MEA + NMP, with H2S \\nabsorption becoming more favorable. Conversely, the reduction in CO2 \\nideal selectivity with aqueous MEA and MEA + SFL, is marginal shifting \\nto almost plateau with increased acid gas concentrations. It can be \\ngenerally inferred that the order of CO2 ideal selectivity for MEA-based \\nsolvents is with SFL > NMP > H2O. \\nSimilar tendencies are observed with DEA-based solvents (provided \\nin Fig. 11b); however, the order of CO2 ideal selectivity is more \\nconsistent with the change in acid gas concentration, with NMP > SFL >\\nH2O. These general trends indicate that water-free amines have a higher \\nmaximum affinity to CO2 compared to their aqueous counterparts, at the \\nexamined conditions. \\nThe absorption enthalpy for each acid gas, illustrated in Fig. 12, were \\nassessed based on the thermodynamic relation shown in Eq. (9), using \\nthe predicted solubility isotherms depicted in Fig. 10. The relevance of \\nthis criteria relies on the fact that absorption enthalpy contributes to the \\ntotal solvent regeneration energy (see Eq. (8)). Irrespective of the sol\\xad\\nvent, increasing the acid gas loading decreases the absorption enthalpy \\nfor the solvent. Regardless of the absorbed acid gas, MEA-based solvents \\nconsistently had higher absorption enthalpies compared to DEA-based \\nsolvents. Additionally, aqueous solvents had the higher absorption \\nenthalpy compared to their hybrid counterparts, except in the case of \\nFig. 8. Polar soft-SAFT predicted thermodynamic properties of aqueous and water-free solvents included in this work, for a) mass liquid density of solvent at 30 wt% \\namine, b) viscosity of solvent at 30 wt% amine, c) pure fluid enthalpy of vaporization, and d) pure fluid heat capacity. \\nI.I.I.

Focusing solely on CO2, the order of \\nabsorption enthalpy in terms of utilized physical co-solvents is H2O >\\nNMP > SFL, for both MEA and DEA chemical solvents, which is \\nconsistent with their absorption capacities at low CO2 partial pressure, \\nshown in Fig. 10a and 10b. Conversely, for H2S absorption in MEA-based \\nsolvents, the highest enthalpy was observed for MEA + SFL, while the \\nlowest was for MEA + NMP, up to H2S loading of 0.6 molH2S.mol−1\\nAmine, \\nconsistent with the inflection point observed in H2S absorption in MEA- \\nbased solvents, depicted in Fig. 10c. Contrary to that, the highest H2S \\nabsorption enthalpy in DEA-based solvents was for aqueous DEA, while \\nthe lowest was for DEA + NMP. \\nTowards effectively assessing the potentiality of hybrid solvents for \\nacid gas removal, the trade-offs between the three standard KPIs, \\nnamely, acid gas cyclic capacity, CO2 ideal selectivity, and solvent \\nregeneration energy as shown in Fig. 13, was assessed based on the \\npreviously obtained results shown in Figs. 10 – 12, and by using Eqs. (6) \\n– (8). For acid gas absorption, increasing the partial pressure of the acid \\ngas in the incoming feed gas, irrespective of the solvent, makes the ab\\xad\\nsorption process more efficient, in terms of increased cyclic capacity, \\nand decreased regeneration energy. Additionally, for both MEA and \\nDEA-based solvents, the aqueous solvents demonstrated higher cyclic \\ncapacity, but on the expense of higher solvent regeneration energy. \\nContrary to that, the hybrid solvents demonstrated reduced cyclic ca\\xad\\npacities, however, they are associated with much higher reduction in \\nregeneration energy. In terms of CO2 ideal selectivity, all the solvents \\ndemonstrated relatively similar selectivity towards CO2, except for DEA \\n+ NMP which had a higher affinity to absorb CO2 compared to H2S. \\nThe incremental change for each KPI for the hybrid solvents with \\nrespect to their aqueous counterparts, are relatively large at low acid gas \\npartial pressures, however, these differences slowly diminish with \\nincreased acid gas partial pressure. Judging based on incremental \\nchanges, the highest gain (reduced regeneration energy) compared to \\nthe lowest loss (reduced cyclic capacity and CO2 ideal selectivity) is \\nobtained using NMP as a physical co-solvent compared to water in the \\ncase of CO2 and H2S absorption. This is due to the inherent compromise \\nbetween reducing the absorption energy and increasing the cyclic ca\\xad\\npacity. As such, it can be seen that the most promising solvent based on \\nthese KPIs would be the MEA + NMP hybrid solvent. \\n3.2.3. Assessment based on sustainability metrics \\nIn addition to the technical performance previously explained, the \\nsolvents were also assessed using sustainability metrics, including HS \\nindex based on the work of Koller et al. [73], along with LCA metrics \\nobtained from FineChem tool [74,75]. The estimated values for each \\nsolvent, chemical and physical are included in Table S7 in the SI. The \\nsolvents were ranked based on aggregated performance in each metric \\nassuming 30 wt% amine, with the goal of minimizing environmental, \\nhealth, and safety impacts as included in Fig. 14. \\nAmong the examined solvents, the sustainability performance of \\naqueous amines is far greater than their hybrid equivalents, this mainly \\ndue to the type of physical co-solvents, i.e., water, with its more benign \\nand environmentally friendly production and handling, as water is the \\ngreenest available solvent. The picture is completely changed with the \\nuse of other physical co-solvents such as NMP and SFL, resulting in \\nincreased safety and health hazards, along with larger environmental \\nimpact with solvent production. Focusing solely on both physical co- \\nsolvents, NMP outperforms SFL as a co-solvent in terms of GWP asso\\xad\\nciated with solvent production, and its health index, due to its higher \\ndosage limits for acute toxicity and irritation. Conversely, SFL can be \\ndeemed better than NMP in terms of lower CED for solvent production, \\nbetter safety index due to its higher boiling point, flash point, and auto- \\nignition temperature, which are precursors for hazards such as mobility, \\nfire and explosion, and reaction decomposition. Exploring opportunities \\nfor “greener” organic diluents such as alcohols or ketones might be \\nnoteworthy [88], albeit their performance in the other assessment cat\\xad\\negories. For the examined chemical solvents, the use of DEA as opposed \\nto MEA presented better overall performance with the imposed sus\\xad\\ntainability metrics. Notwithstanding, the results of this simplified anal\\xad\\nysis, though carrying some level of errors, still can help guide the \\nsynthesis of new emerging solvents and shed light on an extremely \\nunder-examined solvent selection criterion. \\n3.2.4. Overall comparison and assessment \\nIn this session we present and discuss the ranking of the solvents \\nbased on their performance in each of the three categories. For the sake \\nof simplicity, all criteria were given an equal contribution, and ranked \\naccordingly. Please, notice that the results will be completely different if \\ndifferent weights were given to each contribution (for instance, double \\nweight to technical performance versus HS, or other options), however, \\nthis is the first approach on considering all these categories to rank \\nsolvents for acid gas removal. \\nFor simplicity, the solvent ranking based on solvent properties was \\nlimited to viscosity due to its higher contribution to CAPEX and OPEX \\ncompared to density. Additionally, the effect of thermal properties such \\nas heat capacity and enthalpy of vaporization were implicitly accounted \\nfor in computing the solvent regeneration energy, which is one of the \\nstandard KPIs. The solvents ranking per each category is presented in \\nFig. 15. The hybrid solvents MEA + NMP and MEA + SFL were the best \\nperforming solvents in terms of standard KPIs for CO2 and H2S absorp\\xad\\ntion, due to the trade-off between the slight reduction in cyclic capacity \\nas compared to the larger reduction in solvent regeneration energy. \\nConversely, aqueous amines had the best performance in terms of sol\\xad\\nvent properties, in particular, due to their lower viscosities. With this \\ntaken into account, the intermediate viscosity of MEA + NMP along with \\nits best performance in terms of KPIs for acid gas removal might deem \\nthis solvent as a potential replacement for aqueous MEA. \\nAlbeit that, the inclusion of sustainability metrics was a game \\nchanger that altered the entire ranking of the solvents, with MEA + NMP \\nbeing the most hazardous in terms of environmental, health and safety \\nfactors, while aqueous MEA is one of the most environmentally benign \\nsolvents. However, the addition of these metrics shed a light on an \\nFig. 9.

This is somehow expected, being water an environ\\xad\\nmentally friendly solvent, but the approach offers a path to take into \\naccount sustainability metrics when searching for alternative solvents. \\nHence, the question remains to the actual importance regarding the \\ninclusion of sustainability metrics. The current trend in choosing sol\\xad\\nvents for acid gas removal reduces all of the possible metrics to a single \\nvalue, being the unit cost of acid gas removal based on techno-economic \\nassessment. One can argue that the importance of sustainability metrics \\ncan be restricted to limited stages throughout the acid gas removal value \\nchain, mainly during solvent production, along with any possible \\nemissions or wastes during process deployment. However, such con\\xad\\nsiderations are still needed as they can dictate the design of safety layers \\nfor process operation, waste disposal, and other aspects that can detract \\nfrom the possible benefits of deploying these alternative solvents. \\nWith this, the inclusion of sustainability metrics should be enforced \\neven during solvent selection stages, and the search for “greener” co- \\nsolvents might open the path for finding promising hybrid solvents \\ncapable of usurping the golden standard, aqueous MEA. \\n4. Conclusions \\nIn this work, a multi-criteria assessment framework, considering \\ntechnical performance and sustainability metrics, has been employed to \\nassess the potentiality of hybrid solvents for acid gas removal. The \\nexamined solvents were formed from the combination of chemical sol\\xad\\nvents, such as MEA and DEA, with physical co-solvents, such as NMP and \\nSFL. Polar soft-SAFT was used a thermodynamic model, validated using \\navailable experimental data in a systematic manner from pure fluids, \\nrelevant binary mixtures, and acid gas (CO2 and H2S) absorption in the \\ninvestigated hybrid solvents, and used to predict the required thermo\\xad\\nphysical properties at process separation conditions. Subsequently, the \\nperformance of the selected hybrid solvents and their aqueous equiva\\xad\\nlents were assessed for acid gas removal in terms of three general cat\\xad\\negories, (1) solvent properties, (2) standard key performance indicators, \\nand (3) sustainability metrics. The solvent assessment was carried out \\nstepwise for each category, revealing trade-offs between the different \\ncriteria. \\nFor solvent properties, the reduced thermal properties of hybrid \\nsolvents offered an opportunity to reduce the overall regeneration en\\xad\\nergy, yet on the expense of increased solvent viscosity.

The\\nperformance of the QD-driven system greatly exceeds that of the benchmark aqueous system (926 turnovers with a quantum yield of\\n0.81% and selectivity of 82%), due primarily to (i) electrostatic attraction of the QD to the catalyst, which promotes fast\\nmultielectron delivery and colocalization of protons, CO2, and catalyst at the source of photoelectrons, and (ii) termination of the\\nQD’s ligand shell with free amines, which capture CO2 as carbamic acid that serves as a reservoir for CO2, eﬀectively increasing its\\nsolubility in water, and lowers the onset potential for catalytic CO2 reduction by the Co-porphyrin.

Since Rate-Based model, compared to Equilibrium model, gives more \\naccurate simulations of CO2 capture processes by amine solvent, it is used in this study. Mass transfer \\ncorrelations are significant parameters in Rate-Based model, and using them improperly will lead to \\nconsiderable disagreement between real and simulated results.   \\nIn the present work, mass transfer coefficients in CO2 capture processes are evaluated using an aqueous \\nblend of piperazine activated 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (a-AMP) solution for the first time.

In the first evaluation, 12 sets of data are achieved following the changes of the operational \\nparameters, gas flow rate and CO2 partial pressure, while other parameters such as operational \\nabsorption temperature, solvent flow rate and solvent blends of AMP+PZ remain constant. The studies \\nindicate that considering the amount of CO2 absorbed, the Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of Onda et al., \\nBravo-Fair, and Billet-Schultes mass transfer coefficients are 12 %, 7.63 %, and 3.2 % respectively in \\ncomparison with Khan et al. results.

The CO2 capture by aqueous\\nsolutions of 3 is expected to occur via Path II (see Supporting\\nInformation, Figure S11 and Table S2 for more details). The\\ncross-peak interaction between H7 and H11 of the phenolate\\nwith HDO observed on NOESY results (Figure 3a) and the strong\\nhydrogen bonds between the zwitterions and the surrounding\\nwater molecules calculated by DFT (Figure 5a) support our\\nhypothesis of the mechanism via Path II.

It is worth noting\\nthat CO2 loading in the first cycle is greater than subsequent\\ncycles for the solutions of 3 and 4, especially 3.

There are some reasons for the lower\\nestimated value of enthalpy for CO2 desorption in aqueous\\nsolutions of 3 compared to MDEA (Figure 8) and the value\\ncalculated in Scheme 2. The desorption process involves the\\ndeprotonation of the conjugated acid of the applied base, and\\nthe bond dissociation energy (BDE) of O\\x00H bonds of phenols[31]\\ndiffers from that of amino N\\x00H bonds.[32] Additionally, to fully\\nunderstand the thermodynamic origin of the enthalpy of\\ndesorption, the solvation enthalpies of the ionic species present\\nin the media should be considered. The value of the solution\\nenthalpy is determined by breaking solute-solute and solvent-\\nsolvent intermolecular interactions (endothermic terms) and\\nforming solute-solvent interactions (exothermic term). It is well\\nknown that the solvation enthalpies of salts in water vary\\nsignificantly with the anions[33] and cations.[34] In the case of\\nzwitterionic compounds, the absorption process also involves\\nneutralizing the charge of the phenolate group, which probably\\ndisrupt the structure of dimeric forms and reduce the net\\nenergy released.

Recent theoretical work indicates\\nthat phenoxides solutions exhibit a faster CO2 hydration\\nreaction kinetics compared to amine solutions.[35] However, a\\ncomprehensive assessment of the overall adsorption rate\\nnecessitates additional experimental data, including mass trans-\\nfer information for CO2 absorption in zwitterionic phenolate\\nsolutions. The obtained HP-13C NMR data clearly show the 13C\\nsignals of chemosorbed CO2 are separated from those of\\nphysiosorbed CO2. Therefore, it allows the estimation of Henry’s\\nsolubility law[36] that was determined (without the interference\\nof other CO2 species that may be present in the aqueous\\nsolution),[37] by the quotient of the aqueous phase molality (m)\\nto that of the gas phase and determined via inversed gated\\ndecoupling 13C NMR analysis of the solutions with molality of\\n3.5 m (\\x060.1) at different pressures.

This represents a huge advantage of the basic\\naqueous zwitterionic solutions compared with other systems\\nbased on amines, carboxylates and phenolates reported so far\\nthat generally also generate CO2 adducts.[23a,38]\\nThe chemisorption of CO2 (formation of bicarbonate) is\\nalmost constant (1.0 mol/mol; see Figure S8) from 10 to 40 bar,\\nindicating that from 10 bar the base was completely consumed\\nand the acid-base equilibrium is established. Only the amount\\nof physiosorbed CO2 increases with pressure (Figure 9). The\\ntotal amount of chemo- and physiosorbed CO2 of up to\\n1.3 mol/mol can be attained for aqueous solutions of 3 (3.5\\nmolal) at 40°C and 40 bar (Figure 9b).\\nThe slope of the fitted curves for physiosorbed CO2 data as\\na function of the pressure corresponds to Henry’s solubility\\nconstant: 1.8×10\\x007, 2.6×10\\x007 and 2.3×10\\x007 mol/kg/Pa for MDEA,\\n3 and 4, respectively.

A depiction of\\nthe apparatus and set-up is given in Figure S12. The pressure\\ncontrol valve was adjusted to maintain the pressure of the sorption\\nvessel at 1.3 bar absolute during the absorption test. The temper-\\nature of the reaction vessel was adjusted to the absorption\\ntemperature (T1), typically 40°C. Then, 5 mL of 1 M aqueous salt of\\n1,3-dimethyl-2-(3-oxy-phenyl)-imidazolium or 1,3-dimethyl-2-(4-oxy-\\nphenyl)-imidazolium was added to the reaction vessel. The system\\nwas purged with CO2 for 5 s, closed and the reservoir filled with\\nCO2 at 4 bar (absolute). The magnetic stirrer was initiated, and the\\npressure drop in the CO2 reservoir monitored to determine the\\nnumber of moles of CO2 consumed. For the calculations, the ideal\\ngas state equation and the previously calibrated volume of the\\nreservoir were considered. The end point of absorption was\\ndetermined when a plateau was observed for at least 10 min on\\nthe reservoir pressure graph as a function of time. At the end of the\\nabsorption stage, the system was opened, and the temperature of\\nthe thermostatic bath adjusted to the desorption temperature (T2),\\ntypically 100°C.

The synthesis process involves the preparation of highly porous magnetic nano-\\ncomposites, followed by functionalization with dithiocarbamate functional groups through a reaction with carbon disulfide \\nand amine. The synthesized nanocomposite was thoroughly characterized using various techniques, including X-ray dif-\\nfraction analysis, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, \\nand thermogravimetric analysis. The performance of the mesoporous nanocomposite as an adsorbent for removing Pb(II), \\nCd(II), and Cu(II) cations from contaminated water was evaluated. The study finds that the maximum removal efficiency for \\nPb(II), Cd(II), and Cu(II) cations is achieved at pH values above 4.

Additionally, the appropriate amount of adsorbent required \\nfor complete elimination of the heavy metal cations is determined.

To overcome these challenges, three \\nmodified heterogeneous mesoporous catalysts, CMK-3-SiO2, CMK-3-MCM-41, CMK-3-SBA-15, \\nand SO42-/ZrO2 solid acid catalyst were initially synthesized and investigated to determine their \\ncatalytic effectiveness in the process of CO2 and MEA solvent regeneration with CO2 loading of \\n0.5±0.02 mol CO2/mol MEA at 97oC. According to the experimental results, the CMK-3 modified \\ncatalyst significantly decreases the energy requirement for CO2 desorption. The catalytic \\nperformance of the synthesized catalysts was in the order of CMK-3-SiO2 > CMK-3-MCM-\\n41>CMK-3-SBA-15>SZ respectively. CMK-3-SiO2 exhibited the best catalytic performance by \\nenhancing desorption rate by 195%, and decreasing the energy requirement by 37.41% compared \\nwith the monoethanol amine as a blank run. Furthermore, the CMK-3-SiO2 catalyst exhibited the \\nbest catalytic performance compared to the literature with an excellent stability and with no \\nunfavorable effects on the MEA-CO2 absorption activity for the regenerated amine solvent. This \\nperformance seems to be a result of the large mesoporous surface area (BET) and large number of \\nBrϕnsted and Lewis acid sites. In addition, a reasonable reaction mechanism for the amine solvent \\nregeneration with the CMK-3 heterogeneous catalyst is proposed. \\nKeywords: CO2 capture process, Amine solvent regeneration, Energy penalty, Modified \\nheterogeneous catalysts, desorption rate. \\n \\n \\nPage 2 of 35\\nACS Paragon Plus Environment\\nACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\n46\\n47\\n48\\n49\\n50\\n51\\n52\\n53\\n54\\n55\\n56\\n57\\n58\\n59\\n60\\n \\n3\""

        "Abstract": "'a b s t r a c t\\nIonic-liquids are considered alternatives to conventional aqueous-amines absorption solvents due to\\ntheir carbon dioxide afﬁnity, low vapor-pressure, high thermal stability and low heat-ratio. In this\\ncontext, this work ﬁrstly approaches a new natural gas decarbonation process based on ionic-liquid\\n[Bmim][NTf2] absorption and selective solute stripping at high-pressure and high-temperature (2-\\nstaged-stripping initiating at 50 bar and 250 \\x01C) taking advantage of the high thermal resistance of\\nhalogenated ionic-liquids. Its strong points have to do with its high-pressure stripping (50 bar) which\\nimpressively lowers carbon dioxide compression power for enhanced oil recovery destinations. Conse-\\nquently, such new process burns less fuel for power production and is a cleaner production alternative to\\ntraditional aqueous-amine-based decarbonation processes which strip carbon dioxide at only 1e2 bar.\\nSecondly, the positive aspects of new ionic-liquid decarbonation process were conﬁrmed in two new\\nmulti-criterial sustainability-related implemented procedures: (i) new ionic-liquid multi-criterial\\nscreening for natural gas decarbonation; and (ii) new multi-criterial sustainability assessment of natural\\ngas decarbonation processes. The new multi-criterial screening conﬁrmed the same [Bmim][NTf2] as the\\nmost suited ionic-liquid from environment/engineering relevant properties (e.g., carbon dioxide loading,\\nabsorption-related properties, toxicology and cost), while the multi-criterial sustainability assessment\\nproved that the new [Bmim][NTf2] decarbonation process is ﬁve times cleaner and more sustainable than\\nthe amine-based counterpart, both respectively attaining sustainability degrees of 5.17 and 1.0. In this\\nsustainability assessment, the two decarbonation processes were designed for cleaning natural gas with\\n45%mol carbon dioxide at 60 bar. Processes were scored in terms of compliance to qualitative heuristic\\ncriteria and quantitative sustainability metrics for environmental-economic-social aspects.

The high CO2 absorption capacity of amino acid-based ionic liquids (AAILs) makes them a more\\nplausible carbon capture system than conventional amine solutions. We synthesized an ionic liquid derived from arginine,\\ntriethylmethylammonium argininate ([N2221][Arg]), and utilized it to capture pure CO2 and CO2 from the open air. Although\\nAAILs have some notable advantages for CO2 capture, like low toxicity, biocompatibility, and superior stability, they also have\\nimportant drawbacks, such as high viscosity and low mass transfer. Now, in order to resolve these problems, we blended\\n[N2221][Arg] with a binary mixture of water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a variable volume ratio. On increasing the volume\\nof DMSO in water−DMSO binary mixtures, the CO2 uptake gradually decreased, reaching a minimum in a pure DMSO medium\\nand the maximum in an aqueous solution, which was obtained from the vapor−liquid equilibrium (VLE) experiment.

        "Title": "'Stability of Structurally Varied Aqueous Amines for CO2 Capture\\n'",
        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: Eighteen structurally varied amines were subjected to harsh oxidative conditions, and their stability was assessed and\\nseen in the context of biological and thermal stability. Steric eﬀects play a large role in the stabilization of amines under oxidative\\nconditions, and the presence of carbon dioxide plays a vital role in the degradation pathway of ethanolamine (MEA). Tertiary amines\\nare generally very stable, and are known not to form carbamates to any large extent. Many steric eﬀects play a vital role in\\nstabilization, such as chain length, substituents located both close to and farther from the nitrogen atom, and bond strain. A\\ncorrelation is seen between biodegradability and oxidative degradability, giving similar degradability in both cases. There are,\\nhowever, promising exceptions to this, such as 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine (DMAPA) and 2-dimethylaminoethanol\\n(DMMEA), which are stable under oxidative conditions, but also biodegradable. Direct correlations between oxidative stability and\\necotoxicity or thermal stability are not seen.\\nabstraction mechanism,21,22 although hydrogen abstraction\\nand the less commonly assumed reaction between amine\\nradicals (aminium) and water are also described as possible\\npathways. Following these, primary degradation compounds\\nare a range of secondary products, formed by the reaction\\nbetween these and the amines.17,23−26 Thermal degradation\\npathways also occur due to the increased temperatures in the\\ndesorber column. These pathways seem to be better\\nunderstood than oxidative degradation pathways.27−30\\nThis work does not attempt to fully understand the\\ndegradation mechanisms of every single amine compound\\nstudied, but rather aims to identify features that can allow a fast\\nassessment of amine stability under oxidative conditions.\\nDespite the harsh degradation conditions in these experiments,\\nincluding higher concentrations of oxygen and dissolved iron\\nthan can be expected in reality, an overall picture of\\ndegradability can still be formed. Stability of the amine is a\\ncritical aspect to be considered before moving toward large-\\nscale testing or implementation of a novel amine. It is also\\npotentially a showstopper for upscaling, and, therefore,\\noxidative and thermal stability should be considered in an\\nearly stage of solvent development.\\nWhen upscaling amine-based CO2 removal to the industrial\\nlevel, potential environmental impacts must, also, be\\nconsidered. Environmental persistence of emitted compounds\\nmay result in potential long-term eﬀects and accumulation in\\nthe biota. Thus, ensuring that organic solvents enzymatically\\ndecompose by microbial digestion (often called biodegrada-\\ntion) is essential.\\nThis study is divided into three main parts:\\n• First, the oxidative degradability at absorber conditions\\nof a series of structurally diﬀerent amines is measured\\nunder identical conditions. Also, the inﬂuence of the\\npresence of CO2 on oxidative stability is assessed in\\nethanolamine (MEA).\\n• Second, the biodegradability of some new amines is\\nstudied and compared to the literature data for amine\\nbiodegradation in seawater.31\\n• Finally, the oxidative degradation results are compared\\nto the literature data for biological and thermal stability\\nto discuss whether oxidative degradability can be used to\\nassess these key properties of the amines and vice versa.\\nTitration, ion chromatography (IC), total nitrogen (TN),\\nand total inorganic carbon (TIC) analyses as well as liquid\\nchromatography coupled with mass spectrometry have been\\nFigure 1.

Res. 2021, 60, 5627−5638\\n5629\\nused as means of detection and quantiﬁcation of the degraded\\namines.\\nMechanisms and pathways of oxidative degradation have\\nbeen studied for many years but are yet to be completely\\nunderstood. This work contributes to the existing knowledge\\nbase about the oxidative degradation reactions of amines but\\ndoes not contain mechanistic studies to conclude on the\\npathways of the reactions. The results do, however, point out\\nreasons for considering the carbamate route to have a higher\\nsigniﬁcance in these reactions than earlier assumed.\\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS\\n2.1. Chemicals. All solutions were prepared gravimetrically\\nusing deionized water from an in-house puriﬁcation system at\\nNTNU unless otherwise speciﬁed. Oxygen (O2) and carbon\\ndioxide (CO2) gas were purchased from AGA in N5.0 purity.\\nMillipore water for analytical use was obtained from a Dionex\\nICW-3000 water puriﬁcation system from Merck Millipore,\\nand methanesulfonic acid (MSA, CAS: 75-75-2, ≥99.0%) for\\ncation ion chromatography (IC) was purchased from Merck\\nLife Science/Sigma-Aldrich Norway. Supplier and purity\\ninformation of the tested amines is given in Table 1. Analytical\\nstandards for the anion IC analyses were prepared from\\nsodium formate (CHO2Na, ≥99.0%, CAS: 141-53-7) and\\nsodium oxalate (C2O4Na2, ≥99.5%, CAS: 62-76-0) obtained\\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich, and sodium acetate (C2H3O2Na, ≥99.0%,\\nCAS: 127-09-3) was obtained from Merck. Potassium\\nhydroxide (EGC III KOH, CAS: 1310-58-3) was purchased\\nfrom Thermo Scientiﬁc in eluent generator cartridges.\\n2.2. Oxidative Degradation Experiments. Oxidative\\ndegradation experiments were performed at simulated absorber\\nconditions in custom-made open, water bath-heated, double-\\njacketed glass reactors with magnetic stirring (approximately\\n250 mL), as shown in Figure 1. The reactor temperature was\\nmaintained at 60 °C and the water bath-cooled Graham\\ncondensers at 5 °C. Each reactor was ﬁlled with 200 mL of the\\ngravimetrically prepared 30 wt % (aq.) amine solvent mixture,\\nwhich was preloaded to 0.4 mol of CO2 per mol amine and\\ncontained 0.5 mM iron sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O). A mixture of\\nO2 and CO2 gas was sparged through the solutions from Alicat\\nmass ﬂow controllers (MFC) and through Pyrex glass gas\\ndistribution tubes of porosity grade 1, under constant magnetic\\nstirring for the total experimental time of three weeks. Empty\\ngas wash bottles were used as safety solvent traps between the\\nmass ﬂow controllers and the gas distribution tubes in case of\\npower outage. Sampling from the liquid phase was performed\\nregularly through a septum on top of each reactor. Each\\nexperiment was performed in two or three parallels, and the\\ndata presented in this work are given as the average values,\\nwith the standard deviation of the sample average given as the\\nuncertainty. Uncertainty within each analytical method is given\\nin the description of each method and is additional to the\\nstandard deviation of the sample average.\\nThe initial experimental procedure was designed for\\nmaintaining the loading of the primary amines at 0.4 mol\\nCO2 per mol amine. For this, a total of 60 mL min−1 of gas was\\nused, containing 2% CO2 and 98% O2. This CO2 pressure was\\nnot high enough to maintain the loading of 0.4 of the tertiary\\namines; as a result, the ﬁrst experiments conducted with\\ntertiary amines had a lower CO2 loading. Some experiments\\nwere, therefore, run with a total of 60 mL min−1 gas ﬂow\\ncontaining 16.5% CO2 and 83.5% O2 to keep the loading\\nconstant. Finally, the oxidative degradation of tertiary amines\\nwas performed using a higher total ﬂow of gas. In these\\nexperiments, the same O2 ﬂow as for primary and secondary\\namines (58.8 mL min−1) was used, but the CO2 ﬂow was\\nincreased to achieve the required CO2 partial pressure to\\nmaintain a loading of 0.4 mol CO2 per mol amine, resulting in\\na higher ﬂow. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence in degradation could be\\nseen in the tertiary amines tested under diﬀerent conditions, so\\nsome of these experiments were not repeated.\\n2.3. Marine Biodegradability Tests. Closed bottle\\nbiodegradation tests of amines were performed by SINTEF\\nOcean, according to the OECD guideline 306 “Biodegrad-\\nability in seawater”.32 Natural seawater was collected from a\\nlocal Norwegian fjord (Trondheimsfjorden; 63°26′N,\\n10°24′E). The seawater was transported to the laboratory of\\nSINTEF Ocean through a polyethylene pipeline system from a\\ndepth of 80 m, well below the thermocline, and securing stable\\ntemperatures the year around. The seawater had a salinity of\\n34‰, and the water source was considered to be nonpolluted.\\nThe seawater was ﬁltered (50 μm), acclimated (20 °C) for 5\\ndays, aerated for 20 min (bubbling of sterile-ﬁltered air), and\\namended with inorganic nutrients (N, P, Ca, Mg, and Fe\\nsources) (OECD).32 Biological oxygen demand (BOD) bottles\\n(275 mL) were completely ﬁlled (no headspace) with\\nacclimated, ﬁltered, and nutrient-amended seawater with 2\\nmg L−1 test substances, aniline (positive control), or nutrient-\\namended seawater without test- or control substance (seawater\\nblank). Biocide test solutions (50 mg L−1 HgCl2) were\\nincluded to determine potential abiotic degradation. The\\nsolutions were incubated at 20 °C for up to 28 days, and\\nbottles were sacriﬁced for dissolved oxygen (DO) analyses on\\ndays 0, 7, 14, and 28 (duplicate samples except on day 0). The\\nBOD of each substrate was determined by calculating the\\ndiﬀerences between DO concentrations in blank and test\\nsolutions. The ultimate biodegradability of each substance was\\ndetermined as the percentage of its theoretical oxygen demand\\n(ThOD). ThOD was calculated assuming complete mineral-\\nization to CO2 of the test substance and release of nitrogen in\\nthe form of ammonia (NH3) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2).32\\nNO2 is formed in the further reaction of NH3 with oxygen,\\nresulting in ThOD of NH3 being lower than that of NO2.\\n2.4. Analytical Methods. The concentration of amine in\\nthe solutions was determined by titration with sulfuric acid\\n(H2SO4, 0.2 N) according to Ma’mun et al.,33 a procedure with\\nan uncertainty of ≤2%. For all of the samples, the\\nconcentration of amine was back-calculated to the solution\\nwithout CO2 and corrected for evaporation of water and\\ndegradation products, assuming a linear loss throughout the\\nexperiment, as the total mass of the solution is only known for\\nthe start and end solutions.\\nThe total concentration of heat-stable salts (HSS) was\\ndetermined according to a method described by Reynolds et\\nal.34 by adding approximately 2 g of the sample to 40 mL of\\nactivated Dowex 50W-X8 ion-exchange resin (Merck, CAS:\\n69011-20-7) and 40 mL of deionized water. The mixture was\\npartly covered and heated to 70 °C under magnetic stirring for\\nan hour and then left to cool to room temperature and settle.\\nThe supernatant was carefully transferred to another container\\nthrough a frit, and the ion-exchange resin was extracted\\nrepeatedly by the addition of 40 mL of water, stirring for 1\\nmin, leaving the resin to settle, and combining the resulting\\nsupernatant by ﬁltering, until the supernatant attained the pH\\nof the deionized water. The combined supernatants were\\ntitrated with 0.05 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH, CAS: 1310-\\nIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research\\npubs.acs.org/IECR\\nArticle\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c00502\\nInd. Eng. Chem. Res. 2021, 60, 5627−5638\\n5630\\n73-2) to determine the molar concentration of cationic species.\\nAnalysis of 30 wt % (aq.) MEA with known concentrations of\\noxalic, formic, and acetic acids showed deviations of ±0.007\\nmol kg−1 (max 7%).\\nQuantiﬁcation of amine concentrations by ion chromatog-\\nraphy (IC) was performed on a Thermo Scientiﬁc Dionex ICS-\\n5000 system, using a Thermo Scientiﬁc Dionex IonPac CS19\\nanalytical column (2 × 250 mm), with a CG19 guard column\\n(2 × 50 mm) and an eluent consisting of 15 mM\\nmethanesulfonic acid (MSA) in ultrapure water from an\\nICW-3000 Millipore puriﬁcation system. Calibration was\\nperformed with each compound for every analysis, and all\\ndata were processed using the chromatography processing\\nsoftware Chromeleon 7. The method used for cation\\nchromatography was based on that developed and used by\\nFytianos et al.35 Standard solutions of concentrations between\\n10 and 100 ppm of the compound (amine) to be quantiﬁed\\nwere prepared and analyzed along with the diluted samples.\\nThe standards were used to construct a calibration curve for\\neach individual amine and each individual analytical procedure,\\nand their conductivity signals (peak areas) were used to\\ncalculate the concentration of the original samples.\\nAcetate, formate, and oxalate were quantiﬁed using a\\nThermo Scientiﬁc Dionex ICS-5000 system located at USN\\nPorsgrunn, with a Dionex AG11-HC RFIC analytical (4 × 250\\nmm) and guard column (2 × 50 mm) and conductivity\\ndetection. The column compartment was kept at 35 °C and\\nthe cell temperature at 30 °C. A gradient of potassium\\nhydroxide (KOH), generated by an eluent generation (EG)\\nsystem, was used as the eluent, with the program given in\\nTable 2. Standards of the organic acids were prepared in the\\nconcentration range from 1 to 30 ppm, and the degraded\\namine samples were diluted between 1:100 and 1:350 with\\ndeionized water, depending on their known total content of\\nheat-stable salts (HSS). All standards and samples were ﬁltered\\nfrom any remaining particulate matter before analysis.\\nQuantiﬁcation of the concentrations of some alkanolamines\\nwas performed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass\\nspectrometry (LC-MS), performed by SINTEF Industry on a\\nUHPLC Agilent 1290 Inﬁnity System with an Agilent 6490\\nTriple Quadrupole detector. An Ascentis Express Phenyl-\\nHexyl, 2.7 μm HPLC Column and a Discovery HS F5 HPLC\\nColumn, both from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC, were used for\\nanalyte separation. MEA and N-methylaminoethanol (MMEA)\\nwere quantiﬁed using an isotope-labeled internal standard, and\\nthe results exhibited a typical uncertainty of 3%. Quantiﬁcation\\nof 3-(methylamino)propylamine (MAPA) and diisopropyl-\\nmethyl amine (DMPA) in samples analyzed without isotope-\\nlabeled standards exhibited an uncertainty of 5%.\\nA Shimadzu TOC-LCPH analyzer equipped with a TN unit\\nand an auto sample injector (ASI) was used for the\\nquantiﬁcation of CO2 loading as total inorganic carbon\\n(TIC) and total nitrogen (TN). The instrument was calibrated\\nwith sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) for the CO2 analysis and\\npotassium nitrate (KNO3) for the nitrogen analysis. The\\nuncertainty of the CO2 quantiﬁcation was ≤2%, when used in\\nthe range of 10−500 ppm carbon. The TN analysis was only\\nused to compare the nitrogen content in the start and end\\nsamples, as matrix eﬀects have proven to impact the ability of\\nthe method to quantify diﬀerent amines with a universal\\ncalibration. Both the TIC and TN analyses were performed in\\nthe range of <500 ppm N to avoid saturating the detector\\nsignal. The principle of quantiﬁcation of inorganic carbon in\\nthe sample is based on acidiﬁcation with phosphoric acid\\n(H3PO4, 25 wt %), releasing the inorganic carbon, including\\nthat bound as carbamate, as CO2. The detection is then made\\nwith a nondispersive infrared detector (NDIR), selectively\\nmeasuring at the wavelength of bond vibrations in the CO2\\nmolecule. Nitrogen can be combusted over a platinum catalyst\\nat 720 °C and fully converted to NO2, which is detected and\\nquantiﬁed by a chemiluminescence detector.\\nTable 2.

Eng. Chem. Res. 2021, 60, 5627−5638\\n5631\\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\n3.1. Oxidative Degradation. Oxidative degradation of\\namines was primarily quantiﬁed as the loss of alkalinity\\nthroughout the experiments, as this reﬂects the CO2 capture\\neﬃciency of the solvent. TN analysis, IC, and LC-MS were\\nused both for validation and for supporting information about\\nthe degradation patterns of the amines. The eﬀect of the amine\\nstructure on oxidative stability is shown in Figures 2 and 3.\\nOverall, the trend shows that all tertiary amines are generally\\nstable under oxidative conditions, secondary and primary\\namines less so, in agreement with the studies of Lepaumier et\\nal.,17 Voice and Rochelle,36 and Voice et al.37 This is, however,\\nonly true if no additional steric hindrance is present in the\\nproximity of the nitrogen group(s), such as Lepaumier17\\npostulated for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP). If the\\noxidative degradation mechanisms mainly take place via\\ncarbamates and not pure amines reacting with the oxidant,\\nthis pattern can partly be explained by the lack of carbamate\\nformation from tertiary amines. The most stable primary amine\\nstudied in this work, the sterically hindered AMP, is also\\nknown for forming bicarbonate over carbamate in aqueous\\nsolutions.38 Next, a more detailed discussion is given.\\nAs mentioned earlier (Section 2.2), the experimental\\nconditions needed adjustment to the vapor−liquid equilibrium\\nproperties of the tertiary amines, and several tests with ﬁve\\ndiﬀerent amines hardly gave signiﬁcant diﬀerences in\\ndegradability regardless of CO2 or O2 concentrations and\\nend loading of CO2. A comparison of the diﬀerent tested\\nexperimental conditions can be seen in Table 3, where each\\ngiven amine was subjected to the oxidative degradation\\nconditions for three weeks, with two diﬀerent compositions\\nof the gas phase or diﬀerent total gas ﬂows. The table shows\\nthe total loss of amine (alkalinity) at the end of the experiment.\\nAll experiments had a loading of 0.4 mol CO2 per mol amine at\\nthe start of the experiment. As shown in Table 3, all tertiary\\namines tested, except for 1DMA2P, had losses of <5%\\nalkalinity during three weeks under highly oxidizing conditions.\\nIf the compounds studied have comparable structures, apart\\nfrom a small substituent on the nitrogen atom, increasing the\\norder of the amine, a general increase of stability can be seen\\nwith increasing order. This can be seen for the three amines in\\nthe center of Figure 2, MEA, MMEA, and 2-dimethylamino-\\nethanol (DMMEA). The only structural feature diﬀering is the\\nsubstitution of hydrogen by methyl groups on the nitrogen\\natom, which increases the stability from 53% amine loss\\n(MEA), through 41% (MMEA) to only 4% (DMMEA). A\\nsimilar trend can be observed when comparing 2-\\n(ethylamino)ethanol (EAE) and N,N-diethylethanolamine\\n(DEEA). A combination of the carbamate formation reaction\\nof tertiary amines and an exposed amine group can make the\\nprimary amines more prone to degrade oxidatively than amines\\nof higher substitution. Moreover, other structural features also\\nincrease oxidative stability. Figure 4 shows the degradation of a\\nselection of primary amines over time and shows that all\\namines with more complexity degrade slower than MEA.\\nAddition of steric hindrance in β-position relative to the amine\\ngroup, such as in amino-2-propanol (MIPA), increases\\noxidative stability. Increasing steric hindrance by addition on\\nthe α-position, such as in AMP, increases the oxidative stability\\nof a primary amine to the range of tertiary amines in this study.\\nEven just extending the chain length relative to MEA, looking\\nat the primary amine 3-aminopropanol (AP) and 2-(2-\\naminoethoxy)ethanol (DGA), increases the stability signiﬁ-\\ncantly. The results of this study suggest that the carbamate of\\nthe amine may play a more signiﬁcant role in the oxidative\\ndegradation pathways than previously assumed. This assump-\\ntion is further supported by an oxidative degradation\\nexperiment with MEA, identical with the other experiments,\\nbut without the addition of CO2. In this case, the amine loss is\\nFigure 3.

Thus, the\\nresults are not conclusive, and more mechanistic studies are\\nneeded to fully understand the role carbamate may play in the\\ndegradation mechanisms of amines.\\nFigure 6 shows that secondary amines can also be relatively\\nunstable under oxidative conditions; both MMEA and EAE as\\nwell as MAPA, a diamine with one secondary and one primary\\namine group, gave a high relative amine loss after 21 days\\nunder oxidative conditions. However, the diamine piperazine\\n(PZ) containing two secondary amine groups is very stable\\nthroughout the whole experiment. With its cyclic form, the\\nlower ﬂexibility of the C−N bond compared to MMEA, EAE,\\nand MAPA can explain this stabilizing eﬀect. The step in a\\nradical reaction where electron transfer can take place requires\\nthe reactants to arrange the position of its atoms to the\\nconﬁguration of the products since this reaction is very fast.40\\nThis means that certain ﬂexibility within the bonds of\\nmolecules being oxidized is required for the oxidation to\\noccur. The rigidity of the C−N bonds in PZ may be less likely\\nto enter a conﬁguration where the radical oxidation reaction\\ncan take place. The high oxidative stability observed for PZ in\\nthis work is in agreement with that of Voice and Rochelle.36\\nAs discussed earlier, most of the studied tertiary amines\\nshowed amine losses <5% after three weeks under oxidative\\nconditions. Even the diamine 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propyl-\\namine (DMAPA), which contains a primary amine function-\\nality, and the cyclic 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine (AEP),\\ncontaining both a primary and a secondary amine function.\\nIn the case of AEP, the secondary amine group is incorporated\\nin the cyclic structure, like PZ, so this group is protected by the\\nrigidity of the ring structure. The primary groups of DMAPA\\nand AEP are likely shielded by steric eﬀects that protect the\\nmolecules from attack or constructing a lower compatibility\\nwith the radical donor, potentially favoring termination rather\\nthan propagation. A sterically hindered molecule has less bond\\nﬂexibility and less possibility to exist in many conﬁgurations,\\nsuch as resonance forms and rotational isomerism. 1DMA2P\\npresented itself as an outlier among the tertiary amines, with a\\ntotal amine loss of 31% after 21 days under oxidative\\nconditions. Despite being tertiary, this amine behaves more\\nlike the structurally similar, although primary, MIPA. It can be\\nspeculated whether a hydroxy substituent in the β-position to\\nthe nitrogen on a secondary carbon may be unfavorable for\\nstability, allowing for the mechanism shown in Figure 7 to take\\nplace. In this suggested mechanism, both amines form acetone,\\nand additionally, 1DMA2P forms dimethylamine and MIPA\\nammonia, all volatile degradation compounds. This may be the\\npredominant degradation mechanism for 1DMA2P, but in\\nMIPA, the content of nonalkaline nitrogen, as seen in Figure 8,\\nindicates that other pathways may be more or as dominant.\\nFigure 5.

Res. 2021, 60, 5627−5638\\n5633\\nTo introduce further structural variance to the study, we\\nwanted to see the eﬀect of adding an aromatic functionality to\\nthe amine. Therefore, we attempted to study the aromatic\\namine benzylamine (BzA) under oxidative conditions, both in\\n30 and 15 wt % (aq.) concentrations. In both cases, phase\\nseparation occurred before a week had passed. A thick, viscous,\\nand dark organic phase with a higher density than water was\\nformed, and no alkalinity could be detected in the aqueous\\nphase anymore. At 60 °C, the benzylamine carbamate was\\nsoluble in water, although it precipitated at room temperature,\\nas reported in Richner et al.41 Therefore, the attempt to study\\nBzA, an aromatic amine, under these conditions was\\nabandoned.\\nThe analysis of total nitrogen content after three weeks of\\noxidative degradation, compared to the start, as well as\\ncomparing it to the remaining alkalinity of the solutions, gives\\nan impression of the type of degradation compounds formed,\\nas shown in Figure 8. It is evident that volatile nitrogen-\\ncontaining degradation compounds, such as ammonia (NH3),\\nhave been formed where the nitrogen content of the initial\\nsolution has not been conserved throughout the experiment.\\nThis approach does not identify the volatile, nor the less-\\nvolatile, degradation compounds, but it allows an assessment of\\nthe amount of emissions that can be expected from a given\\namine. The primary amines form a more or less equal amount\\nof volatile and less-volatile nitrogen-containing degradation\\nproducts. This is probably due to the cleavage of the C−N\\nbond forming NH3 that escapes the liquid phase. Secondary\\namines like MMEA and EAE are known to form volatile\\nalkylamines,42 so at least for these, we can assume that a\\nsigniﬁcant part of the nitrogen lost is not in the form of NH3.\\nFor the secondary amines, more of the nitrogen is contained in\\nthe liquid phase in the form of nonalkaline degradation\\nproducts. No correlation between nitrogen loss and amine\\nvolatility could be found when looking at the respective boiling\\npoints. This can be seen illustrated in the Supporting\\nInformation, in Figure S1. The high loss of nitrogen from\\nMAPA correlates with what was observed by Vevelstad et al.43\\nwhen using a similar open-batch oxidative degradation setup.\\n3.2. Comparison of Diﬀerent Methods of Amine\\nAnalysis. For control and comparison, the concentration of\\namine was measured by cation ion chromatography (IC) in\\naddition to amine titration to validate the results obtained by\\nthe titration by an independent method. IC separates ionic\\ncomponents based on their charge density and aﬃnity to the\\nmobile and stationary phases of the chromatographic system.\\nThe signal obtained from each component in the form of a\\npeak, which can be integrated and quantiﬁed by comparison to\\na calibration curve, is characteristic for the amine but can also\\noverlap with other compounds of similar charge densities.\\nOther compounds can also falsify the titration results, as all\\nalkaline components will give the same signal. Comparing the\\nresults from the two methods increases the certainty of the\\nmeasured concentrations originating from the desired com-\\npound.\\nFor four amines, a time series was also sent for LC-MS\\nanalysis at an external laboratory, for further validation and\\ncomparison. A visual representation of the results from the\\nthree diﬀerent analytical methods is shown in Figure 9. The\\ndiﬀerent methods show some deviations from one another, but\\noverall, the same trends. Throughout the experimental period,\\nthe remaining alkalinity measured by titration in MAPA is\\nhigher than the amount of MAPA quantiﬁed by cation IC and\\nLC-MS, although the standard error of the average of the two\\nFigure 9.

MAPA with its two amine\\nfunctionalities is likely to degrade on just one of them and\\nremain active or alkaline despite being degraded. A deviation\\nbetween titration and IC/LC-MS is, therefore, expected in this\\ncase. The relatively large deviation between LC-MS and IC/\\ntitration for DMPA may be due to the lack of an internal\\ndeuterated standard of DMPA, also yielding a higher\\nuncertainty for this amine and MAPA, than for MEA and\\nMMEA, where internal standards were used for quantiﬁcation.\\n3.3. Heat-Stable Salts (HSS). Anion IC analyses were\\nperformed on the end samples after 21 days of oxidative\\ndegradation of the amines. Formate, acetate, and oxalate were\\nmeasured in diluted samples of all amines, and Figure 10 shows\\nthe concentrations of these in the amines where a quantiﬁable\\namount of at least one of the acids was found.\\nFormate could be quantiﬁed in all of the amine samples that\\ndegraded signiﬁcantly during the three-week experiments and\\nin DMMEA and DMPA, both of which had low relative amine\\nlosses. Since most of the amines that are unstable under\\noxidative conditions also are carbamate-forming amines, it\\nseems likely that carbamate plays a more signiﬁcant role than it\\nhad in the earlier suggested degradation mechanisms. The\\npossibility of formate originating from the carbonyl group of\\nthe amine carbamate, as illustrated in Figure 11, should\\ntherefore be considered.\\nAcetate was only found in concentrations above the\\nquantiﬁcation limit in two of the degraded solutions, EAE\\nand MIPA, and oxalate in three, EAE, MEA, and MMEA.\\nAcetate and formate have both been observed to be formed in\\nother oxidation studies of MIPA.44 EAE or similar structures\\nhave not been seen to be particularly prone to form acetate\\nunder oxidative conditions, but we suggest that the reaction\\nmay take place as depicted in Figure 12, where the positively\\ncharged nitrogen in EAE allows for an attack by an oxygen\\nradical or a superoxide ion formed in the solution. Following\\nan analogous mechanism, DMPA, MAPA, and MMEA would\\nform formate.\\nThe total heat-stable salt analysis shows that there are other\\nionizable degradation products present than the three, which\\nwere quantiﬁed by ion chromatography, some of which could\\nalso be observed in the anion chromatograms, although not\\nidentiﬁed. The ion chromatogram of the degraded MEA can be\\nfound in the Supporting Information, as depicted in Figure S2.\\n3.4. Biodegradation. Since alkanolamines may not\\nevaporate in the environment and have poor aﬃnities for\\nsoil,45 these compounds may end up in aquatic systems and\\neventually in seawater. Since biodegradation of several\\nalkanolamines was faster in fresh water than in sea-\\nwater,31,46−48 biodegradability in seawater may also be used\\nas a good representation of biodegradability limitations of\\namines in this work.\\nFive amines were tested for ultimate biodegradation in\\nseawater, and the results are presented in Table 4, where the\\namines are also classiﬁed as natural or synthetic. The results\\nshow that 1-(2HE)PP, 1DMA2P, and AEP have low marine\\nbiodegradability, below 20%, whereas DMMEA and DMAPA\\nare highly biodegradable. As expected, and also observed in\\nprevious studies, the naturally occurring amines have a higher\\nbiodegradability than synthetic amines. In addition to the\\nresults given here, abiotic tests were performed for all amines,\\nall showing that they do not degrade in the absence of\\nmicrobes under the given conditions (results given in Table\\nS8).\\nPiperazine and piperidine (AEP and 1-(2HE)PP) showed\\npoor degradabilities, as previously seen with some other cyclic\\namines.31 The two degradable amines (DMMEA and\\nDMAPA) were associated with terminal alcohol or amine\\ngroups, typically subjected to enzymatic attack during amine\\nbiodegradation.50,51\\n3.5. Comparison of Oxidative, Thermal, and Biode-\\ngradation. Since one of the most common pathways of\\nbiological amine degradation reactions occurs through catalysis\\nby the monoamine oxidase enzymes,52 it is not unexpected to\\nﬁnd a correlation between oxidative and aerobic biological\\ndegradability (Figure 13). Most of the amines that were\\nunstable under oxidative conditions in the experiments\\nperformed in this work also showed a high biodegradability\\nwhen compared to the results of marine biodegradability\\nstudied both in this work and in previous studies.31 There are,\\nhowever, some amines that are stable under oxidative\\nconditions and still have a high biodegradability, properties\\nthat are favorable from a combined industrial and environ-\\nmental perspective. Another observed trend in Figure 13 is that\\nmost of the highly degradable amines are of natural origin and\\nthe ones showing low degradability are of synthetic origin. In\\nthe case of biodegradability, this makes sense, as there is a\\ncompatibility between natural compounds and enzymes, but it\\ncan interestingly also be seen as a trend for oxidative\\ndegradability in the absence of microorganisms. Ideally, for\\nindustrial use, one would want an amine that would be stable\\nunder oxidative conditions but biologically unstable so that it\\ncan degrade in nature in case of a spill. This is the case for two\\nof the tested amines, DMMEA (94% of ThOD) and DMAPA\\n(55% of ThOD). DMMEA was pointed out as a promising\\nFigure 10.

All compounds with a biodegradability above 60%\\nof ThOD are considered readily biodegradable.\\nThe knowledge of biological degradability is insuﬃcient for\\nassessing the total impact of an amine in case of a spill in\\nnature. Ecotoxicity tests provide additional information that\\nallows assessing the amines potential eﬀect on the local\\nenvironment if leaked. Eide-Haugmo et al.31 also studied this\\nin a marine environment and the ecotoxicity was tested\\naccording to the ISO/DIS guideline 10253, with the marine\\ndiatom Skeletonema costatum.54 There is no visible correlation\\nbetween biological degradability and ecotoxicity in this case.\\nNone of the amines from this study were deemed acutely toxic\\nto marine life, but many of them fall into the category of\\n“slightly toxic.”\\nIn addition to the conditions with high oxygen availability\\nand relatively low temperatures, as simulated in these oxidative\\ndegradation experiments, thermally aggravating conditions are\\nmet in the desorber and reboiler of a CO2 capture plant. To\\nassess the overall stability of the amines tested, a comparison\\nwith thermal degradation data from Davis et al.28 and Eide-\\nHaugmo53 is given in this section. Because the experiments\\nwere performed under slightly diﬀerent conditions, the\\ndegradability is normalized in regard to the amine with the\\nhighest amine loss at the end of the experiment as shown in\\nFigure 14, which was MEA in the study of Davis et al.28 and\\nMMEA in Eide-Haugmo,53 since small diﬀerences in\\nexperimental conditions make a direct comparison and\\nvisualization diﬃcult. The oxidative degradability has also\\nbeen normalized in relation to the amine loss of MEA. Exact\\namine losses can be found in Table S5. The comparison shows\\nthat oxidative stability not necessarily means thermal stability,\\nas AEP, MDEA, and DMAPA all seem very promising after\\nstudying their stability under oxidative conditions but have\\nproven to have a low relative thermal stability.\\n4. CONCLUSIONS\\nAfter nearly 3 decades of studies focusing on mechanistic\\nunderstanding of oxidative degradation of amines, there are\\nstill many unknowns when it comes to its reaction pathways.\\nThis work contributes to the existing knowledge with some\\nnew insights from laboratory-scale degradation experiments.\\nEthanolamine (MEA) has a high oxidative stability in the\\nabsence of CO2, indicating that MEA carbamate partakes in\\nthe initiation step of the oxidative degradation reaction. In\\ncontrast, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), which is a\\nsimilar but sterically hindered primary amine known to form\\nbicarbonate over carbamate in reaction with CO2, hardly\\ndegrades under oxidative conditions.

        "Title": "'Kinetic evaluation of sterically hindered\\namines under partial oxy-combustion\\nconditions\\n'",
        "Abstract": "'Abstract\\nBACKGROUND: Carbon capture and storage is considered one of the pillars that should support greenhouse gas (GHG) emission\\nmitigation by 2050. In this sense, partial oxy-combustion emerges as a promising alternative. Its advantages rely on the produc-\\ntion of a higher CO2 concentration ﬂue gas than these provided by conventional air-ﬁring processes. The use of higher CO2 con-\\ncentrations should improve the solvent kinetic and the CO2 cyclic capacity.\\nRESULTS: The kinetic behaviour of two representative sterically hindered amines, namely 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP)\\nand isophrondiamine (IF), were studied under partial oxy-combustion conditions in a laboratory-scale semi-batch reactor. The\\nCO2 concentration varied from 15%v/v to 60%v/v. The kinetic enhancement experienced by AMP at high CO2 concentration was\\nslightly >60%, instead of 70–80% for IF. AMP also improved its CO2 absorption capacity by 24.7%, from 15%v/v to 60%v/v,\\nalmost doubled the improvements achieved by monoethanolamine (MEA). In the case of IF experiments, the CO2 loading\\nincreased ≈10% from 15%v/v to 60%v/v CO2 and it changed from 1.10 to 1.34 mol CO2 mol–1 solvent, representing a >20%\\nincrease.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The presence of higher CO2 concentrations accelerated CO2 absorption and provided higher CO2 absorption\\nrates. In addition, the evolution of the CO2 loading also exhibited higher values in the experiments using higher CO2 concen-\\ntration ﬂue gas. The steric hindrance causes a hybrid behaviour in these solvents, between both fast and slow kinetic solvents.\\nThe kinetic rates observed using AMP were slightly higher than MEA, but lower than IF which showed the fastest kinetics.\\n© 2020 Society of Chemical Industry\\nKeywords: carbon capture; kinetics; clean processes; separation; emissions; pollution control\\nNOMENCLATURE\\nChemicals\\nAMP, (−)\\n2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol\\nIF, (−)\\nisophorondiamine\\nMEA, (−)\\nmonoethanolamine\\nSymbols - Reactions\\nAmH (−)\\nAmine\\nAmH2\\n+ (−)\\nAmine protonated\\nAmCOO−(−)\\nCarbamate\\nAmH+COO−(−)\\nZwitterion intermediate\\nB (−)\\nBase\\nBH+ (−)\\nBase protonated\\nCO2 (−)\\nCarbon dioxide\\nH+ (−)\\nHydron\\nHCO3\\n−(−)\\nBicarbonate\\nH2O (−)\\nWater\\nOH−(−)\\nHydroxide ion\\nSymbols – Equations\\n[AmH]\\n(kmol m–3)\\nAmine concentration\\n[B] (kmol m–3)\\nBase concentration\\n[CO2] (kmol m–3)\\nCarbon dioxide concentration\\n[CO2]IN (vol%)\\nCarbon dioxide inlet concentration\\n[CO2]OUT (vol%)\\nCarbon dioxide outlet concentration\\n[H2O] (kmol m–3)\\nWater concentration\\n[OH−] (kmol m–3)\\nHydroxide ion concentration\\n⊍(mol CO2 mol–1\\nsolvent)\\nCO2 loading\\n⊍* (mol CO2 mol–\\n1 solvent)\\nCO2 loading at equilibrium\\nk1 (m3 kmol•s–1)\\nForward reaction rate constant for CO2\\nabsorption reaction via zwitterion\\nk-1 (s−1)\\nBackward reaction rate constant for CO2\\nabsorption reaction via zwitterion\\nkb (m3 kmol•s–1)\\nForward reaction rate constant for zwitter-\\nion hydrolysis reaction\\n* Corresponding to: Fernando Vega, Chemical and Environmental Engineering\\nDepartment, School of Engineering, University of Seville, C/ Camino de los Des-\\ncubrimientos, s/n 41092 Sevilla, Spain.

        "Abstract": "'Abstract: Capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from post-combustion gas \\nstreams is an energy-intensive process that is required prior to either \\nconverting or sequestering CO2. There are a few commercial offerings \\nof 1st and 2nd generation aqueous amine technologies, however the \\ncost of capturing CO2 with these technologies remains high. To \\ndecrease costs of capture, researchers are designing efficient solvent \\nsystems with the goal of being drop-in replacements for 1st and 2nd \\ngeneration infrastructure. One approach has seen the development of \\nwater-lean solvents that aim to increase efficiency by reducing the \\nwater content in solution. Water-lean solvents such as GE’s GAP/TEG \\n(Gamma Amino Propyl aminosilicone/TetraEthylene Glycol) are \\npromising technologies, with potential to halve the parasitic load to a \\ncoal-fired power plant, only if the intrinsically high solution viscosities \\nand hydrolysis of the siloxane moieties could be mitigated. We \\npresent here, an integrated multidisciplinary approach to overhaul the \\nGAP/TEG solvent system at the molecular level to mitigate hydrolysis \\nwhile also reducing viscosity. We present molecular-level insights into \\nchemical speciation of CO2-containing ions, showing that co-solvents \\nand diluents have a negligible effect on reducing viscosity and are not \\nneeded. This finding allowed for the design of single-component \\nsiloxane-free diamine derivatives with site-specific incorporation of \\nselective chemical moieties for direct placement and orientation of \\nhydrogen bonding to reduce viscosity. Ultimately, these new single-\\ncomponent diamine formulations are less susceptible to hydrolysis \\nand exhibit up to a 98% reduction in viscosity compared to the initial \\nGAP/TEG formulation.   \\nAvailable at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3366219 \\n[10] \\nF.

A 2D mathematical model based on ﬁnite element method (FEM) was established to\\nsolve the steady-state continuity equations for the shell, tube and membrane sides simultaneously. The inﬂu-\\nences of the operating parameters on the CO2 absorption ﬂux in HFMC including liquid and gas velocity and CO2\\npartial pressure were comprehensively investigated. The numerical results show that the CO2 absorption ﬂux can\\nincrease with the increasing liquid velocity and CO2 partial pressure, and slightly increases with the increasing\\ngas velocity. Moreover, the CO2 absorption performance of aqueous DEAB solution was further compared with\\ndiﬀerent amine solutions, which reveals that the CO2 absorption ﬂux of DEAB is higher than those of DEA, MDEA\\nand AMP, and is also comparable to MEA. The analysis on the mass transfer resistance indicates that the pro-\\nportion of the membrane mass transfer resistance increased rapidly from 13.7% to 75.3% as membrane wetting\\nratio increased from 0% to 20%. Instead of the liquid phase, the mass transfer in wetted membrane phase\\nbecomes the rate-controlling step ultimately. The increase in the membrane wetting leads to the signiﬁcant\\ndecrease in CO2 absorption performance with 49.4% and 80.5% decrease in CO2 absorption ﬂux and the overall\\nmass transfer coeﬃcient at membrane wetting ratio of 5% and 50%, respectively.

This work proposes and assesses an \\nalternative high-pressure temperature-swing hydrogen decarbonation that promotes stripping at high-pressure \\nreducing carbon dioxide compression costs. Such new hydrogen decarbonation uses 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazo\\xad\\nlium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide ionic-liquid physical-absorption due to its solute affinity, low vapor- \\npressure, high thermal stability and low heat consumption for carbon dioxide stripping at high-temperature \\nand high-pressure.

Though assessments have been published regarding \\nwhich technologies are more cost-effective and energetically efficient, these often either neglect inspecting the \\nimpact of raw biogas concentrations and biomethane delivery pressures on the overall performance of the plant, \\nor they do not consider that the separated CO2 has to be conditioned for transportation for properly fulfilling the \\nrequirements of BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage).

However, complexity and nonlinearity of the capture processes hinder the incorporation of \\ntheir first principles models into analyses and optimizations of overall carbon management strategies. \\nAccordingly, it is desirable to have a systematic method to develop a computationally less demanding \\nsurrogate model, which can replace the rigorous CO2 capture process model, for use in a high-level \\ndecision-making environment. For such purposes, the surrogate model should be able to provide \\nmultiple information needed to connect to subsequent processing steps under varying source stream \\nconditions. This research addresses the development of surrogate models for CO2 capture processes that \\nenjoy significantly lowered complexity while preserving the key information. A surrogate model can \\nbe constructed by fitting the input-output data generated by process simulation and optimization with \\nthe rigorous model. Following the proposed method, surrogate models for the amine-based CO2 capture \\nprocesses with two representative types of amines, monoethanolamine (MEA) and piperazine (PZ), are \\nconstructed and validated. The constructed surrogate models predict the specific steam consumption \\nrate and total equipment purchase cost based on the input information of desired capture rate and CO2 \\nsource stream condition. The predicted information is shown to agree well with the simulation result of \\nthe rigorous first principles model. This surrogate modeling approach can be applied to compare \\ndifferent capture technologies in the context of analyzing and synthesizing a larger CCUS processing \\nnetwork.\\nKeywords: carbon capture, surrogate model, amine scrubbing, process optimization, techno-economic \\nevaluation\\nPage 2 of 40\\nACS Paragon Plus Environment\\nIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\n46\\n47\\n48\\n49\\n50\\n51\\n52\\n53\\n54\\n55\\n56\\n57\\n58\\n59\\n60\\n3\\n\\uf06e'"

        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: Capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere is a scientific and\\ntechnological challenge. CO2 can be captured by forming carbamate bonds with amines,\\nmost notably monoethanolamine (MEA). Regenerating MEA by releasing captured CO2\\nrequires that the carbamate solution be heated. Recently, photoacids were used to induce a\\npH change to release CO2 from aqueous carbonate solutions. We report a merocyanine\\nphotoacid that releases CO2 from nonaqueous carbamate solutions of MEA, which has a\\nCO2 loading capacity that is higher than that of water. On the basis of the absorption spectra\\nof the photoacid in the presence of acids and CO2, we show that the photoacid cycle and the\\nCO2 capture of MEA are two separate equilibria coupled to each other via protons. We\\ndemonstrate that irradiating the sample with 405 nm light induces the release of CO2, which\\nwe detect using an in-line mass spectrometer. This work highlights an alternative path for\\noptimizing a photoinduced CO2 capture and release system.\\nC\\nontrol over the atmospheric CO2 concentration is an\\nimportant contemporary scientific and technological\\nchallenge. A number of direct air capture (DAC) technologies\\nhave emerged recently, including some that convert CO2 into\\norganic or inorganic carbonates and carbamates during\\nabsorption.1 Concurrent with DAC technologies, it is also\\nnecessary to develop methods to desorb and release a pure\\nCO2 stream for potential conversion to fuels or other products.\\nThis challenge is especially important when CO2 adsorption is\\nhighly exothermic, which requires significant energy for its\\ndesorption. For example, the capture of CO2 by the well-\\nknown reagent monoethanolamine (MEA) is highly exother-\\nmic (ΔH = −80 to −100 kJ/mol);2 hence, expelling CO2 from\\nthis reagent requires that the solution be heated to temper-\\natures of >400 K,3 which also greatly enhances water\\nvaporization and amine degradation. Taken together, the\\ntotal energetic cost to thermally regenerate an aqueous amine\\ncapturing solution is split among the heat required to increase\\nthe temperature of the solution, the heat of water vaporization,\\nand the heat required to desorb CO2.3 As such, isothermal\\ndesorption methods would more precisely target CO2\\ndesorption to decrease the cost of regeneration.\\nAn alternative approach takes advantage of the pH\\ndependence of the dissolved CO2 vapor−liquid phase\\nequilibrium. In prototypical capture solutions, a primary or\\nsecondary amine is deprotonated by self-exchange with\\nanother amine or by a separate Brønsted base. This enables\\nthe deprotonated amine to act as a strong base and attack the\\nLewis acidic carbon on CO2, making a carbamate bond (Figure\\n1).4,5 Acidifying the solution reprotonates the amine and shifts\\nthe equilibrium to favor the release of CO2. Subsequently, the\\nexcess acid is removed to regenerate the starting sorbent.

A\\nconnection between light excitation and pH swing is achieved\\nby using photoacids, which are molecules that release protons\\nupon absorbing light. It is important for the photoreleased\\nprotons to remain in solution with sufficient lifetimes to induce\\nchemical changes in the environment and not recombine with\\nthe conjugate base. A class of photoacids, metastable\\nphotoacids, have been recently studied as the active agents\\nfor photoinduced pH swing desorption because of the long\\nlifetime (greater than microseconds) of their conjugate\\nbase.9−15 A prime example of this kind of class is the\\nmerocyanine dyes (Figure 1). Upon irradiation, the protonated\\nmerocyanine form (MCH) releases H+ and undergoes\\ncyclization to form spiropyran (SP). In the dark, the MCH\\n⇆SP + H+ equilibrium is dependent on pH, with MCH\\nfavored at low pH and SP favored at high pH. When MCH\\nabsorbs light, the equilibrium is further shifted to favor the SP\\nform and the release of a proton. A rich body of literature\\nspanning many years has reported the synthesis, chemical\\nmodification, solvatochromism, and dynamics of this family of\\nphotoacids.10,16−18 A major application of this class of\\nphotoacids for controlling the CO2 concentration in aqueous\\nand binary dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water solutions was\\nrecently reported by Alfaraidi and co-workers13 and de Vries\\nand co-workers.14 Similar photoacids in basic aqueous\\nsolutions have also been studied for CO2 capture and\\nphotoinduced release.12,19,20 These seminal studies clearly\\ndemonstrated the release of CO2 by light and opened the path\\nfor generalizing and broadening the concept.\\nThere are two reasons to extend the concept of light-\\ncontrolled CO2 release in nonaqueous environments. First,\\nalthough water can adsorb CO2, the loading efficiency is not\\nremotely comparable to those of the commonly used capture\\nagents that are based on amines. Hence, amines such as\\nmonoethanolamine (MEA) are widely used in commercial\\nCO2 capture. Second, the merocyanine photoacid that is the\\nfunctional agent of photocontrol is known to irreversibly\\nhydrolyze into indolium and salicylic acid derivatives10,14,21−23\\nwith a half-life on the order of hours. Therefore, to make the\\nphotocontrol of CO2 release practical, it is crucially necessary\\nto extend the concept to nonaqueous environments.\\nHere, we report the use of a merocyanine photoacid for the\\nrelease of CO2 from the archetypal CO2 capture agent MEA in\\nthe absence of water. Amine-based systems have been\\nextensively studied24−26 for CO2 capture due to their favorable\\nthermodynamics and kinetics.3,26 However, the relevant\\nequilibria and kinetics for photoacids remain understudied in\\nthese nonaqueous solvents. We tested whether a canonical\\nmerocyanine-based metastable photoacid (hereafter termed\\nPA1), first reported by the Liao group (Figure 1),16 could\\nsuccessfully drive pH swing desorption in a CO2-saturated\\nMEA solution (see Section S1 of the Supporting Information\\nand Figure S1 for synthetic details).\\nFigure 1 illustrates the coupled equilibria of PA1 and CO2\\ncaptured by MEA. For amines to capture CO2, a deprotonating\\nbase is necessary. In MEA, deprotonation occurs via proton\\nself-exchange with another MEA molecule, generating\\nammonium. The deprotonated amine forms a carbamate\\nbond with the CO2, while the ammonium, which is effectively a\\nreservoir of protons in the solution, is in equilibrium with the\\nphotoacid. The relevant states of PA1 are the protonated\\nMCH and the deprotonated SP forms, which are in\\nequilibrium with each other and the proton reservoir in the\\nsolution in the dark. When MCH absorbs light, it releases its\\nproton and is converted into the SP form. The released proton\\nadds to the proton reservoir in the solution, which in turn\\nshifts the CO2 capture equilibrium by protonating the\\ncarbamates and releasing the CO2. Note that unlike pH-\\njump experiments in aqueous solutions, MCH should not re-\\nform on its own without further addition of CO2 to repeat the\\ncycle.\\nIn Figure 2, we provide evidence that the CO2−PA1\\nequilibria, as shown in Figure 1, are linked via protons. Because\\nMEA is a base, the photoacid MCH is deprotonated in MEA,\\nmaking the SP form the dominant species. This is identified by\\nthe known ultraviolet absorption of the SP form, with a peak at\\n370 nm (black line, Figure 2a). When CO2 is added to the\\nsolution, carbamate is formed and the solution is acidified\\naccording to the equilibrium illustrated in Figure 1. The\\nreleased protons shift the PA1 equilibrium toward MCH, as\\nevidenced by the characteristic absorption peak near 400 nm\\n(blue line, Figure 2a). To ensure that the observed absorption\\nis truly caused by the addition of free protons, we acidified a\\nsolution of MEA containing PA1 without adding any CO2 and\\nobtained a similar absorption spectrum (dashed blue line,\\nFigure 2a). The acidification was done with glacial acetic acid'"

Les flux d’absorption de CO2 mesurés dans des solutions aqueuses de MDEA-PZ à une \\ncomposition d’intérêt industriel permettent d’étudier la synergie des deux amines vis-à-vis de \\nl’absorption de CO2.  \\nPar ailleurs, un modèle d’absorption avec réactions chimiques – de vitesse finie ou à l’équilibre – a été \\ndéveloppé afin de comparer plusieurs hypothèses de mécanismes réactionnels. Son utilisation est \\nillustrée sur les mesures de flux d’absorption initiale pour comparer des mécanismes réactionnels. Les \\nrésultats indiquent que les mécanismes simplifiés de la littérature ne rendent pas compte de l’ampleur \\nde la synergie entre les deux amines, en solutions non chargées. Pour améliorer la représentation du \\nmodèle, une réaction de type catalyse pour la PZ pourrait être considérée. \\nRéférences bibliographiques \\nBishnoi, S. & Rochelle, G.T., Absorption of CO2 into aq.

The experimental \\nsetup’s schematic diagram of the absorption lab \\nunit is shown in Figure 1. The packed scrubber was \\nmade of acrylic with a 2 m total height and 40 mm \\ninner diameter, the packing scrubber height was \\n1.8 m, and the packed material was a glass Rash\\xad\\ning ring with a size of 6 mm diameter, and with \\n0.8 mm of a wall thickness which is dumped to the \\nscrubbed randomly, the percentage of free space in \\nthe packing section is 62%, and the contact surface \\narea is about 794 m2/m3. To control the lean alkanol \\namine solution temperature, it stores in a 1000 ml \\nglass flask; the 1000 ml glass flask was kept at a \\nconstant temperature set by an electric heater with \\na stirrer and temperature controller (Dragon Lab, \\nMS-H-Pro, China). The simulated exhaust gas is \\nprovided using a two-gas flow meter that mixes the \\ndesired concentration of carbon dioxide balanced \\nwith nitrogen; the feed pressure of gases pipeline \\nis set to 1.2 atm, which is controlled via pressure \\nregulator valves which then flow controlled with \\na flow meter; after that, fed two streams to a gas \\nmixing T shape connection to mix both gases \\nbefore feeding them to the packed scrubber. The \\nsimulated gas passed through the scrubber from its \\nbase to the top. The lean amine absorbent is pro\\xad\\nvided into the scrubber at the top of the scrubber; \\nit is pumped to the column top at a specific flow \\nrate via a diaphragm pump (Diaphragm pump, \\nTYP-2500NH, China); the rotameter and bypass \\nvalve are installed on the lean amine pipeline to \\ncontrol the liquid flow rate and the head of the \\npump. Thus, the simulated gas and alkanol amine \\nsolvent were in a counter-current flow pattern; it \\nis beneficial to make simulated gas and aqueous \\nalkanol amine solution contact and react effec\\xad\\ntively. When the scrubber\\xa0top outlet concentration \\nof carbon dioxide is constant (0.1 vol.%), a steady \\nstate is reached, which was approximately reached \\nafter 10 minutes of operation, IR gas analyzer \\n(Geotechnical Instruments, BIOGAS 5000, United \\nKingdom) by dual wavelength infrared sensor with \\nreference channel 0–100% vol, with an accuracy \\n±0.5% vol for the range 0–60%, and 60–100% is \\n1.5%, response time for measuring carbon diox\\xad\\nide gas ≤10 seconds, pump with a flow of 550 ml/\\nmin [38], gas analyzer typically was used during \\nthe tests to purge samples and measure the carbon \\ndioxide concentrations. All tests were performed \\nat the ambient pressure (1 atm).

The \\nenhancement of both KGav and ƞ, which may result \\nfrom a rise in the liquid flow rate, could lead to \\nan increase in the alkanol amine\\xa0flow that covers \\nthe packing elements’\\xa0outer surface; this is based \\non\\xa0our observations. According to Vaewhongs et \\nal. (2020), a packed column with a higher liquid \\nflow rate could additionally encounter turbulent \\nmixing of the liquid inside that case, a reduction \\nin the liquid film thickness [36]; another possible \\nexplanation is that the chemical enhancement in \\nthe absorbent, which is related to KGav values, in\\xad\\ncreased as a result of the greater number of chemi\\xad\\ncal molecules accessible to react with carbon \\ndioxide during absorption processes [39]. These \\nfindings were in line with research on carbon di\\xad\\noxide absorption via alkanol amine [36, 39, 40]. \\nHowever, a rise in the\\xa0liquid flow rate has a nega\\xad\\ntive impact on the system’s energy and costs [42]. \\nIn conclusion, the mass transfer performance of \\ncarbon dioxide capturing via alkanol amine is sig\\xad\\nnificantly influenced by the liquid flow rate. \\nEffect of gas flow rate\\nAs shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, both Car\\xad\\nbon dioxide removal efficiency (ƞ) and the over\\xad\\nall volumetric mass transfer coefficients based \\non the gas phase (KGav) were strongly affected \\nby changes in gas flow rate. The obtained ex\\xad\\nperimental results show an increase in the total \\ngas flow rate which was led to a slight increase \\nin KGav value with DETA absorbent for the gas \\nflow rate increased from 3.8408 kmol/m2·h to \\n7.6817 kmol/m2·h then decreased as gas flow rate \\nexceed 7.6817 kmol/m2·h, this slight increase can \\nbe due to many reasons one of them is that DETA \\nis categorized as a Polyamines, a class of poten\\xad\\ntial\\xa0amine absorbent; due to their unique structure \\nof two or more amino groups inside one molecule, \\nthey have been shown to have a high kinetics and, \\nabsorption capacity making them promising ab\\xad\\nsorbents for carbon dioxide capturing [42]; How\\xad\\never, turbulent column conditions are induced by \\na higher gas flow rate which is more favorable \\nto mass transfer; although to the fact that gas’s \\ndetention time in the solution decreased as the \\ngas flow rate increased; thus, the KGav increases \\nas the driving force between carbon dioxide and \\nthe amine is increased, where as there are more \\nmolecules of carbon dioxide available to move \\nfrom the gas bulk side to the gas-liquid bound\\xad\\nary layer [43].

On the \\nother hand, in terms of carbon dioxide removal \\nefficiency (ƞ), it followed a reduction trend for all \\ntypes of amine: in the case of DETA, the ƞ de\\xad\\ncreased from 99.59% to 72.19%, in the case of \\nTETA, ƞ decreased from 99.59% to 57.52%, and \\nin the case of MEA, ƞ decreased from 99.59% to \\n45.45%; this is due to a higher gas flow rates re\\xad\\nsulted in more molecules of carbon dioxide fed \\nto\\xa0 the column, while constant\\xa0 amine molecules \\nin the liquid; furthermore, the increased gas flow \\nrate further reduces the gas’s residence\\xa0 time in \\nthe absorption scrubber and lessens the possibil\\xad\\nity of\\xa0 the\\xa0 carbon dioxide and amine molecules \\nreacting [46].

In addition, a simulation of \\nan actual carbon dioxide capture process can be \\nobtained through research on mass transfer per\\xad\\nformance in a packed scrubber.\\nCONCLUSION \\nThree different absorbent solutions were used \\nin this study; DETA, TETA, and MEA as a sol\\xad\\nvent for carbon dioxide absorption in a randomly \\npacked bed scrubber with Rashing rings pack\\xad\\ning. The impact of operating conditions, includ\\xad\\ning amine inlet concentrations, liquid flow rates, \\ngas flow rate, lean amine loading, inlet carbon \\ndioxide concentration, absorbent temperature, \\nand alkanol amine type, were examined based \\non the two-film concept regarding\\xa0the\\xa0volumet\\xad\\nric overall mass transfer coefficient based on the \\ngas side (KGav), and carbon dioxide removal ef\\xad\\nficiency (ƞ); where\\xa0 the absorption performance \\nwas presented. The investigated outcomes dem\\xad\\nonstrate that DETA and TETA could enhance \\ncarbon dioxide capturing performance, the more \\nimpressive enhancing effects from the DETA \\nabsorbent than conventional MEA absorbent. In \\nline with the order of the absorption capacity and \\nreaction\\xa0rate constant, the carbon dioxide captur\\xad\\ning performance is ranked as follows: DETA > \\nTETA > MEA. The other operational parameters \\nsignificantly influence carbon dioxide absorption \\nperformance regardless of the type of absorbent, \\nwhich demonstrated that the performance of ab\\xad\\nsorption could be enhanced by increasing liquid \\nflow rate and total amine concentration while \\ndecreasing with increasing gas flow rate, lean \\namine loading, inlet carbon dioxide concentra\\xad\\ntion, and absorbent temperature. Additionally, \\nKGav first increased and then declined with a rise \\nin gas flow rate using the DETA solution. These \\ninvestigations show that a DETA solution could \\nbe an effective carbon dioxide absorbent.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe would like to express our deepest grati\\xad\\ntude to the Department of Chemical Engineering, \\nCollege of Engineering, University of Baghdad, \\nfor their invaluable support and resources in mak\\xad\\ning this research possible.

PILs are a class of materials capable of combining the favorable gas affinity\\nexhibited by ionic liquids (ILs) with the processability inherent in polymeric materials. In this\\ncontext, the synthesis of the IL GLYMIM[Cl] was performed, followed by ion exchange processes to\\nachieve GLYMIM variants with diverse counter anions (NTf2−, PF6−, and BF4). Subsequently, PIL\\nmembranes were fabricated from these tailored ILs and subjected to characterization, employing\\ntechniques such as SEC, FTIR, DSC, TGA, DMA, FEG-SEM, and CO2 sorption analysis using the\\npressure decay method. Furthermore, permeability and ideal selectivity assessments of CO2/CH4\\nmixture were performed to derive the diffusion and solubility coefficients for both CO2 and CH4.\\nPIL membranes exhibited adequate thermal and mechanical properties.

Herein, a simple\\nchemical modiﬁcation approach is employed to functionalize\\nbiomass ﬂy ash (BFA) with 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane\\n(APTES) to develop an inexpensive and eﬃcient adsorbent for\\nwater remediation. The amine-functionalized BFA (BFA−APTES)\\nwas fully characterized by employing a range of characterization\\ntechniques. Adsorption behavior of BFA−APTES was evaluated\\nagainst two anionic dyes, namely, alizarin red S (ARS) and\\nbromothymol blue (BTB). In the course of experimental data\\nanalysis, the computation tools of data ﬁtting for linear and\\nnonlinear form of Langmuir, Freundlich, and the modiﬁed\\nLangmuir−Freundlich adsorption isotherms were used with the aid of Matlab R2019b. In order to highlight the misuse of\\nlinearization of adsorption models, the sum of the squares of residues (SSE) values obtained from nonlinear models are compared\\nwith R2 values obtained from the linear regression. The accuracy of the data ﬁtting was checked by the use of SSE as an error\\nfunction instead of the coeﬃcient of determination, R2. The dye adsorption capacity of BFA−APTES was also compared with the\\nnonfunctionalized BFA. The maximum adsorption capacities of BFA−APTES for ARS and BTB dye molecules were calculated to be\\naround 13.42 and 15.44 mg/g, respectively. This value is approximately 2−3 times higher than the pristine BFA. A reasonable\\nagreement between the calculated and experimental values of qe obtained from the nonlinear form of kinetic models veriﬁed the\\nimportance of using equations in their original form. The experimentally calculated thermodynamic parameters including molar\\nstandard Gibbs free energy (ΔadGm\\n0 ) and molar standard enthalpy change (ΔadHm\\n0 ) reﬂected that the process of adsorption of dye\\nmolecules on the BFA−APTES adsorbent was spontaneous and exothermic in nature. Moreover, the used BFA−APTES adsorbent\\ncould be regenerated and reused for several cycles with signiﬁcant dye adsorption capacity. The remediation capability of the BFA−\\nAPTES adsorbent against ARS dye was also demonstrated by packing a small column ﬁlled with the BFA−APTES adsorbent and\\npassing a solution of ARS through it. Overall, we provide a simple and scalable route to convert BFA into an eﬃcient adsorbent for\\nwater remediation applications.'"

The principal products for\\nthe thermal degradation of MEA are recognized as\\nN-(2-hydroxyethyl)imidazole (HEI),\\n1-(2-hydroxyethyl) imidazolidone (HEIA),\\nN-(2-amino- ethyl)-N’-(2-hydroxyethyl)\\nimidazolidin-2-one (AHEIA), N-(2-hydroxethyl)\\nethylenediamine (HEEDA), and 2-oxazolidinone\\n(OZD).46,47 Kim and Sartori first proposed the\\nformation mechanisms of these compounds,48 before\\nDavis et al. further expanded on their findings.46 The\\ncarbamate species is believed to undergo cyclization\\nleading to the formation of OZD.

We shall therefore enumerate the operational\\nchallenges caused by HSSs in this subsection.\\nCorrosion/erosion\\nAs highlighted in the red segments of Fig. 2 (an\\nadaptation of Fig. 1), the locations in absorption units\\nthat are prone to corrosion attacks are usually those\\ninvolving high levels of acid gas loading and elevated\\ntemperatures, example are the absorber (lower\\nsection), condenser, regenerator (whole section), heat\\nexchangers, pumps, and valves.

The study inspired investigations\\nby Emori and coworkers,12,68–70 where they investigated\\nthe deterioration behavior of steel in HSS-containing\\nenvironments for CO2 capture systems. Of particular\\ninterest was time and temperature considerations on\\nthe effect of sodium sulfide for carbon steel corrosion.\\nThey noted that while sulfide impressively inhibited\\nthe corrosion of steel at low concentrations, the\\ncorrosion resistance automatically decreased as sulfide\\nconcentration increased. Moreover, temperature\\nincrement also declined the inhibitive effect of sulfide.\\nSimilarly, the corrosivity of six kinds of HSSs (namely,\\nformate, malonate, succinate, oxalate, glycolate, and\\nacetate) were investigated on carbon steel material by\\nTanthapanichakoon and coworkers, and they found\\nthat while all the tested salts increased the corrosion\\npotential of the absorbing solution to different extents,\\noxalate exhibited the most corrosiveness.15\\nMoreover, erosion–corrosion is another operational\\nproblem in alkanolamine units initiated by high\\nsolution speeds, solution turbulence, and the\\nimpinging gas streams and alkanolamine solutions on\\nthe surfaces of metal structures. These detach\\nprotective oxide layers originally shielding pipes and\\nother structures from corrosion.71–74 When HSS\\nanions are in excess in alkanolamine solutions they\\nmay crystallize and precipitate into several salts.75\\nHence, the consequence of erosion–corrosion is\\nfurther intensified by the existence of suspended\\nparticles like HSSs in alkanolamine solutions.\\nFoaming of absorbing solvent\\nFoaming has been studied recently as one of the\\noperational issues brought on by the production of\\nHSSs.

The most common approach to arresting\\nfoaming is the use of antifoaming agents, such as high\\nboiling alcohols and silicone oils.80–82\\nMansooria et al. investigated the foaming ability of\\nlean MDEA solutions to determine the specific design\\nparameters of an ion exchange resin procedure,25 and\\nthey reported that the presence of HSS was associated\\nwith increased foaming and reduced CO2 loading of\\nthe MDEA solutions. In their study on influence of\\nHSSs on the absorption–desorption capacity of\\naqueous MEA solvent for PCC, Ling and coworkers\\nfound that foaming properties play more superior roles\\nin the absorption rate of CO2 in contrast to the decline\\nof initial pH values or the declining levels of mobile\\namine molecules.83\\nEffect on operational conditions\\n(physicochemical properties) of the\\nabsorbing solvent\\nProcess equipment are designed to work with\\nabsorption liquids that fall within a certain range of\\nphysicochemical properties. Absorbing solvents\\nbecome more dense and viscous when HSSs and other\\ndegradation products are present in high\\nconcentrations,83–85 decreasing the efficiency of heat\\nand mass transmission in the existing equipment and\\nincreasing the power required to circulate solutions in\\nthe system. Changes in the surface tension of\\nalkanolamine may cause the foaming in the solution,\\nand the influence of foaming has been previously\\ndescribed.86 It is noteworthy that the presence of excess\\nof HSS anions in solution can trigger the precipitation\\nand crystallization of different salts.77 As solid particles\\nbecome excess in the solvent, the equipment’s\\ncomponents become fouled and plugged, producing\\nprecipitates in stagnant zones throughout the PCC\\nsystem. The accumulation of precipitates in the heat\\nexchanger and reboiler sections decreases heat transfer\\nefficiency, thereby increasing the overall power\\nrequired for the process. So as not to impair system\\nperformance, the content of HSSs and other\\ndegradation products should be maintained at specific\\nlevels. This is because high HSS concentrations cause\\nthe buildup of carbonate and bicarbonate as well as\\nmore dissolved iron in the solution. Because HSS\\nanions have chelating properties, an increase in HSS\\nconcentration can make amine absorbing solvents\\nmore corrosive. This, in turn, causes the pH of the\\nsolution to drop and its electrical conductivity to rise,\\nwhich damages the protective coating on metal\\nsurfaces within the PCC system, as previously\\nmentioned in this article.15,87–88 Additionally, iron and\\nchromium ions generated from equipment corrosion\\ncan reduce the thicknesses of pipes and equipment,\\nincreasing current densities on the anodic sites, and\\nnecessitating frequent filter replacements.89–91\\nAccording to Rooney and Bacon,92 the overall HSS\\namount should be maintained around 0.5% of the total\\nsolution. Experts from MPR Services Inc. advise\\nkeeping the maximum HSS concentration ≤5000 ppm.\\nIt is also important to note that with increasing\\ntemperature, the amount of HSS and other degradation\\nproducts also increases. Temperature is one of the most\\nextensively researched parameters in the reaction\\nkinetics of CO2 with chemical absorbents because it\\naffects a variety of reaction equilibria, such as those for\\nCO2 absorption, carbamate formation, carbamate\\nhydrolysis, solution pH, and solubility of chemical\\nspecies, and because it aids in resolving problems with\\namine solvent performances. Consequently, corrosion\\nreactions are sped up when solution temperature is\\nraised.15,93,94 One study stated that since the CO2\\nsolubility of AMP is lower than that of MEA, there was\\ntypically less CO2 loading while using AMP at higher\\ntemperatures compared with MEA.94 Ju et al.\\ncompared some physicochemical properties (e.g.\\ndensity, viscosity, refractive index, and electrical\\nconductivity) of lab-based and industry-based\\ndegraded MEA solutions at standard temperature\\nconditions to evaluate the influence of HSSs on the\\nphysical properties of the absorbing solvent.95 They\\nreported that the physicochemical properties displayed\\nmassive dependence on the mass fraction of MEA,\\nmass fraction of HSSs, and CO2 loading. They\\nconducted empirical correlations for the lab-based and\\nindustry-based degraded solutions and concluded that\\nthe correlation of the industry-based degraded solution\\noffered more reliability for density estimation\\ncompared with the lab-based solution.\\nEffect on CO2 absorption capacity\\nAccording to an analysis of the reactions shown in\\nFig. 3, at least 1 mol of the alkanolamine must be\\n884\\n© 2023 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\nGreenhouse.

The produced amine\\nwith water is removed as vapors, while the less-volatile\\nremaining products and HSSs are often settled within\\nthe bottoms.116\\nIn most cases, the distillation media relies on the\\nalkanolamine type as they influence the resistance to\\nthermal degradation. Unlike MDEA that is unlikely to\\ndegrade at temperatures around 182 °С, MEA and\\nDEA are often respectively stable under heating around\\n150 and 175 °С. Notwithstanding, under atmospheric\\npressure, the boiling points of most alkanolamines are\\nhigher than the temperatures at which they thermally\\ndegrade. Thus, distillation is expected to be carried out\\nwithin a vacuum as shown in Fig. 6(A).\\nFor vacuum distillation, the secondary reclamation of\\nMDEA and DEA alkanolamines is a complex\\nprocedure with strict implementation for specific kinds\\nof alkanolamines; however, this remains central to HSS\\nseparation processes. A related study by Golubeva et al.\\nalso presented the vacuum distillation process of\\nleftover amine within a vacuum, as required due to the\\nincrease in MEA and DEA boiling points.118 In view of\\nthis, alkanolamine solvent loss and decrease in heat\\nsteam are drastically reduced to an extent.

Adopting the same principle with strong\\nacid-strong base neutralization reactions, this\\nmethodology involves exchanging ions between solids\\nand liquids, such as the ion exchanges between HSS\\nanions (found in amine absorbing solutions) with\\nstrong base solutions like KOH and NaOH (from the\\nsolid resins). The process basically involves two steps as\\nillustrated in Eqns 11 and 12.11,122\\nAmine H++HSS−+[R]+OH−Amine+H2O + [R]+HSS−\\n(11)\\n[R]+HSS−+ NaOH →[R]+OH−+ Na+HSS−(12)\\nFirst step: Eqn (11) describes the reaction that occurs\\nwhen an alkanolamine solution is streamed over an\\nanionic resin bed ([R]+OH−) to afford the adsorption\\nof HSSs on the resin bed.\\nStep 2: Eqn (12) describes the regeneration process of\\nthe anionic resin bed using NaOH.\\nThe biodegradability of the produced Na salt\\ncharacterizes the advantages of the ion exchange\\nprocedure.122 Several studies have been successful in\\nremoving different anions from waste water solutions\\nusing ion exchange procedures, e.g. chloride.123–126\\nnitrate,127–132 sulfate,133–135 phosphate,136–138 and\\nacetate.123,139 Ion exchange procedures present a\\nchemically facile approach for alkanolamine\\nreclamation, and its performance is deemed\\nsatisfactory for HSS removal with regards to its less\\nchemical involvement, low energy requirement, and\\nsignificantly suppressed solution foaming.122,140 That\\nnotwithstanding, many drawbacks are still associated\\nwith the procedure. Earlier procedures were reported\\neither ineffectual or were characterized by the\\nproduction of enormous amounts of diluted waste\\nwhich necessitated secondary neutralization prior to\\ndisposal.\\nDespite being unsusceptible to chemical and physical\\nwear, Simister et al. reported that ion exchange resins\\nare prone to thermal degradation at elevated\\ntemperature conditions which impacts their\\nreclamation effectiveness.141 Hence, ion exchange\\nprocedures are ideal at low temperature conditions\\n(specifically below 45°C). This informs their strategic\\nlocation around the amine cooler unit. Ion exchange\\nprocedures are driven in semicontinuous, continuous\\nor batch modes, but scientists have favored their\\noperations under the continuous mode because it\\nensures the possibilities of anion treatments at their\\npoints of formation, hence instantaneously averting\\noperational challenges. Bayati et al. described a typical\\ncontinuous ion exchange system (as illustrated in\\nFig. 7) where lean alkanolamine solutions are sent into\\nthe system from the bottom section of the resin\\ncolumn before going through a packed bed and exiting\\nfrom the top.103\\nIn their reclamation testing applied in a PCC pilot\\nplant operation, Moser et al. investigated the potency\\nof ion exchange separation for the reclamation of a\\ndegrading absorbing solution composed of an aqueous\\nsolution of 3 M AMP and 1.5 M PZ at the lignite-fired\\npower plant in Niederaussem after 40 months’\\ncontinuous operation.142 They reported that although\\nion exchange was effective in removing both anions\\nand cations from the absorbing solution, but the effects\\non the degradation rate of the solution require careful\\nexamination.

To simulate HSS ions, total organic acid\\n(TOA) was used as a model contaminant. By using EM\\nforces via the Lorentz principle and a rectangular\\nconfiguration with parallel electrodes, TOA was\\nsuccessfully eradicated. The direction of the electric\\nfield was perpendicular to the path of flow down the\\nchannel to improve the separation of ions at the outlet.\\nThe authors considered the effects of flow rate, voltage,\\nand magnet position on the abstraction efficiency, and\\ndiscovered that the best operating conditions occurred\\nat 2 mL/min flow rate, 3 V applied potential, and\\nparallel-positioned 1T magnets to fluid flow. According\\nto the investigation, polarization took place when only\\nan electrical field was applied, whereas electrosorption\\nof ions onto the aluminum electrode happened when\\nEM forces were introduced. Moreover, in the parallel\\nflow cell, the removal rates of HSS without and with\\nmagnets were 3.2 % and 7.8 %, respectively.\\nMoreover, The EMSR process is operated under\\nvarious operating situations, and its effectiveness has\\nbeen investigated numerically.146 The Navier-Stokes\\nequations are solved using an Eulerian approach, and\\nthe HSS movement is solved using a Lagrangian\\napproach, according to the mathematical methodology\\nutilized for EMSR modeling. Using the developed\\nmodel, the significant factors that influence the\\nseparation process are explored. The study’s findings\\nindicate that raising the temperature of the MDEA\\nsolution improves the efficiency of the EMSR process.\\nIt was discovered that the removal of the HSS is\\nimproved by the drop in MDEA concentration. The\\nstudy discovered that by employing the EMSR, almost\\n70% of the HSS could be removed.\\nHai and coworkers designed an easy-to-use EMSR\\nprocedure for the extraction of HSS from industrial\\nlean amine solution.148 Instead of using\\nelectrosorption, HSS were separated in this procedure\\nusing an electro-polarization mechanism.

It allows the\\nextraction of HSSs even at very low concentrations and\\nthey are achieved with reduced energy utilization.151\\nThis is an improvement to the excessive energy\\ndemand and coevaporation problems associated with\\ndistillation, as well as the specificity for only the\\nseparation of ionic species associated with ion exchange\\ntechnique. The principle of solvent extraction has been\\npopularized in several industrial applications like\\nwastewater treatment, biochemistry and biotechnology,\\nbiofuel treatment, pharmaceutical purification, and\\nenvironment remediation.152–154 Using quaternary\\namine (tri-n-octylamine and aliquat 336) in 1-octanol\\ndiluent for the separation of HSSs resulting from the\\ndegradation of MEA, Akkarachalanont and coworkers\\nare credited with the pioneer work of solvent extraction\\nin CCS application.155 They reported decreased\\nextraction efficiency at elevated CO2 loading and the\\nprocess was not influenced by temperature. As an\\nextension of the study, Karnwiboon et al. substituted\\nthe straight-chained 1-octanol dilutant with a\\nbranched-chain 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and this sufficiently\\nincreased the extraction potency of the solvent.149 The\\nsolvent was also applied in the reclamation of AMP and\\nMDEA, and the extraction efficiency was\\ncomparatively better with MDEA with nearly 100%\\noxalate removal. Kostyanayaa et al. designed a new\\nmethod of combining liquid-liquid membranes with\\norganic solvents for HSS removal.156 The method\\nachieved selective HSS anion extraction by avoiding\\nthe direct mixture of liquid phases. Polypropylene,\\npolysulfone, and polyvinylidene fluoride were the\\ntested membranes, while the extractant contained\\n1-octanol and aliquat 336.

The goal of the adsorption system was\\nto treat the industrial lean MDEA solution and deliver\\nclean MDEA (without TOA) to the column’s exit. The\\nsystem was built such that the same column could be\\nused for both adsorption and regeneration. A known\\nquantity of adsorbent was used to fill the column, and a\\nperistaltic pump was used to pump MDEA solution\\nwith a known concentration of TOA through the\\ncolumn at the specified flow rate in either an upflow or\\ndown-flow mode. The column was manually loaded\\nwith lean MDEA solution and then operated in\\ndown-flow mode to prevent channeling or problems\\nwith viscous fingering. At predetermined intervals,\\ntreated MDEA effluent samples were taken from the\\ncolumn outlet, and the quantities of TOA ions in the\\neffluent were determined using a UV-vis\\nspectrophotometer. Once the concentration of TOA\\nions in the effluent samples equaled the influent\\nconcentration, the column’s operation was terminated.\\nAnalysis was done on the impact of process variables,\\nsuch as flow direction, feed flow rate, bed height, and\\nbed diameter, on the fixed-bed sorption system’s\\nadsorption capacity, breakthrough time, and\\nexhaustion time. The uptake capacity and\\nbreakthrough time were shown to increase with bigger\\nbed diameter and height, lower flow rate, and up-flow\\ncolumn mode, according to experimental data. The\\nadsorbent’s viability was validated by a gradual decline\\nin adsorption capacity after three cycles of adsorption\\nand desorption. Additionally, foaming investigations\\nsupported the crucial function of CAH composite in\\nlowering the foaming ability of lean MDEA solvents\\ndue to the synergy of consecutive biosorption and the\\ndurability of the saturated composites to many in-situ\\nregeneration using CaCl2.\\nTable 4 compares the most applied reclamation\\nmethods with an aim to provide quick and informative\\ndetails of their principles of operation, energy\\nrequirements, etc.\\nReclaimer waste management\\nThe choice of reclamation methodology is typically\\ndependent on both process cost and available waste\\nmanagement procedures.

Therefore, the \\ndevelopment of new methods for CO2 removal is still a challenge. Herein, we employed the \\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT) to explore the potential of different mixtures composed \\nof glycerol and nitrogen-containing bases to capture CO2. By combining glycerol, CO2 and \\nthe bases, it was possible to show that aliphatic amines are able to form intermolecular \\nhydrogen bonds with the primary hydroxyl groups of glycerol, increasing their \\nnucleophilicity and assisting the reaction with CO2 to form glycerol carbonate as the most \\nstable product. To confirm that glycerol carbonate would be experimentally obtained from \\nthe given mixture, we selected triethylamine (TEA) to assist glycerol (Gly) in its reaction \\nwith CO2. The resulting product was characterized by Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier \\nTransform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), 1D and 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance \\nspectroscopy (1H and 13C NMR) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The ATR-FTIR \\nresults showed that TEA is protonated after bubbling CO2 in the glycerol/TEA mixture, \\nsuggesting that the reaction with CO2 occurs after deprotonation of glycerol, forming \\norganic carbonates, as also indicated in the NMR spectra. The combined theoretical and \\nexperimental results indicate that TEA is able to activate glycerol in its reaction with CO2 \\nto form organic carbonates, being an alternative procedure for CO2 capture.\\nKeywords: CO2 capture, glycerol, triethylamine, organic carbonates, glycerol activation, \\nDFT calculation.\\n5\\nabstraction concerted with the nucleophilic attack of the resulting glyceroxide anion onto \\nCO2, is the preferred pathway. Because of the high basicity of compounds in entries 1-3, we \\nobserved a remarkable exothermic and exergonic profile for both reactions, formation of \\neither carbamate or carbonate may occur. This suggests a high-energy demand for the CO2 \\ndesorption step, which is one of the main drawbacks of using amine aqueous solutions for \\nCO2 capture, which must be avoided [6,9,31].\\nInterestingly however, while the formation of carbamates is not favored, the reaction \\nvia activated glycerol forming carbonate/bicarbonate may occur using bases weaker (entries \\n4-10) than TBD and DBU. The low exothermicity for the reaction forming a carbonate \\nintermediate, although still with negative change in the Gibbs free energy, points towards \\nan easily reversible process, a highly relevant requirement for CO2 release after capture. \\nBicarbonate formation after a proton transfer from the protonated base to the carbonate \\n(species 4, Scheme 1) was also investigated. However, excepting for ammonia (ΔH298 = -\\n2.1 kcal mol-1 and ΔG298 = 3.5 kcal mol-1), the bases are strong enough to capture the proton \\nback, even starting the geometry optimization with a structure favoring the bicarbonate \\nspecies, indicating that the bicarbonate derivatives are not stable for the other bases.\\nTo verify whether the reaction would also be possible from the kinetic point of view, \\nwe computed the activation energy for the conversion of 1 into 3. The activation energy \\nwas obtained as the difference between the Gibbs free energy of the transition structures \\n(for converting 1 into 3, Scheme 1) and the corresponding pre-reactive complexes (species \\n1, Scheme 1). For the bases in entries 4-10, the activation Gibbs free energy for the direct \\nreaction is below 5.5 kcal mol-1, an indication that the reactions may indeed be fast. In \\n14\\nparticular, the results indicate that the reaction should occur with the tertiary amines Me3N \\nand Et3N.\\nTo test the hypothesis that a low-cost tertiary aliphatic amine base is able to activate \\nglycerol for further reaction with CO2, we selected the triethylamine (Et3N, TEA) to \\nexperimentally investigate its behavior in the reaction between glycerol and CO2. From a \\npractical perspective, TEA shows interesting properties because it is liquid with low vapor \\npressure (51.75 mmHg at 20 °C), water soluble (112 g L-1 at 20 °C), and it has a boiling \\npoint (bp. 89.3 °C) that would allow work up at room temperature [56,57]. \\n3.2 Experimental studies: characterization of TEA-Gly-CO2 reaction product\\nThe reaction between CO2 and glycerol (Gly) in the presence of Et3N (TEA) was \\ncarried out in a system as represented in Fig. S1a. The product – named as TEA-Gly-CO2 – \\nwas prepared by bubbling CO2 (20 mL min-1) in a mixture of TEA and Gly with a 3:1 \\nmolar ratio at 30 (\\uf0b1 1) ºC under magnetic stirring for 30, 60 and 120 min. At the end of \\neach reaction time, the magnetic stirring and CO2 flow were stopped, and two phases were \\nobserved, the lower phase containing the desired product and the upper phase containing \\nthe remaining base (Fig. S1b). We collected the product at different reaction times (30, 60 \\nand 120 min) as well as before bubbling CO2 (control experiment, 0 min), and analyzed \\nthem by ATR-FTIR, H1 and C13 NMR and TGA. \\nFig. 1 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of the starting reagents (TEA and Gly) and the \\nTEA-Gly mixture (3:1) before and after bubbling CO2 for 30, 60 and 120 min. The spectra \\nof the TEA-Gly-CO2 product show a band at 3288 cm-1 assigned to the stretching \\n15\\nvibrations of O-H groups from glycerol. The protonation of TEA was associated with the \\nappearance of a new band at 1635 cm-1, due to the R3NH+ group. The band at 1287 cm-1 \\nwas assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration mode of C-O-C from the carbonate \\nformation. The bands at 1459 and 1395 cm-1 were associated with the asymmetric and \\nsymmetric stretching vibrations of COO– from carbonate [58,59]. A week band at 1728 cm-\\n1 in the spectra of the TEA-Gly-CO2 product for all reaction times might be assigned to the \\nC=O stretching mode due to bicarbonate species [58–60]. However, the theoretical \\ncalculations indicated that the bicarbonates are not stable in the presence of the bases. One \\nalternative is to assign this band to the carbonate group (species 3, Scheme 1) participating \\nin intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the remaining hydroxyl groups of glycerol [61].\\nThe spectra obtained in the reaction times 30, 60 and 120 min are all identical. The \\nbands at 1728 and 1287 cm-1, associated with C=O and C-O-C stretching vibrations, \\nrespectively, are absent in the mixture of TEA and Gly (3:1) (0 min). Also, the bands at \\n1459 and 1395 cm-1 due to the COO– group were not observed in the mixture of TEA and \\nGly (3:1), indicating that there is not any formation of carbonate before bubbling CO2 in the \\nmixture, as expected. \\n (Insert Fig. 1)\\nTo ensure that the bands assigned to the carbonate in the spectra of Fig. 1 were due \\nto the reaction between CO2 and the mixture of TEA and Gly (3:1), we measured the ATR-\\nFTIR spectrum of the mixture TEA and Gly (3:1) after 120 min (TEA-Gly-120min), \\n16\\nwithout bubbling CO2, under stirring and N2 atmosphere, Fig. 2a. No band due C-O-C \\nstretching vibrations of carbonate was detected. In addition, the absence of the band at 1635 \\ncm-1 due to the R3NH+ group in the TEA-Gly-120min spectrum suggests that the base \\nprotonation occurs only in the presence of CO2, indicating that TEA (pKb = 3.25) might not \\nbe strong enough to deprotonate glycerol. Instead, the free electron pair from TEA is \\nparticipating in an intermolecular hydrogen bond with glycerol and unavailable for the \\nnucleophilic attack on the CO2 molecule [19]. We also investigated the possibility for the \\nreaction between glycerol and CO2 in the absence of TEA, Fig. 2b. This was carried out by \\nbubbling CO2 through glycerol for 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. ATR-FTIR spectra of the \\nsamples were similar to the pure glycerol spectrum, indicating that there is no reaction \\nbetween CO2 and glycerol in the absence of TEA.\\n (Insert Fig. 2a-b)\\n1H NMR spectra of the TEA and Gly mixture (3:1) before and after bubbling CO2 \\nfor 120 min are shown in Fig. S2-S4. The signal assignments are in Table S1. 1H NMR \\nspectrum of the TEA and Gly mixture (3:1) (Fig. S2) before bubbling CO2 shows a quartet \\nat 2.45 ppm assigned to H4 and a triplet at 0.94 ppm due to H5 from TEA [62,63]. Two \\ndouble doublets at 3.30–3.41 ppm are assigned to H1 and H3 of glycerol, and a multiplet at \\n3.45–3.48 ppm is due to H2 of glycerol. The O-H groups appear as a broad singlet at 4.21 \\nppm [64].\\n17\\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of the product TEA-Gly-CO2-120min (Fig. S3) shows three \\nsets of multiplets in the range of 3.29–3.50 ppm, assigned to H1’, H2’ and H3’ of glycerol. \\nNew multiplets in the range of 1.30–1.39 and 0.84–0.91 ppm are assigned to H4’ and H5’, \\nrespectively, of TEA after protonation, showing an upfield shift of these signals after \\nbubbling CO2 in the TEA-Gly mixture [65]. A broad multiplet at 4.14–4.16 ppm, Fig. S4, \\nsuggests an overlapping of the signals due to O-H of glycerol and N-H of protonated TEA \\n[43]. The appearance of a multiplet at 7.66–7.70 ppm (Fig. S4) could be attributed to either \\nthe hydrogen of the bicarbonate group or to the O-H group of glycerol involved in an \\nintramolecular hydrogen bond with carbonate. As the theoretical calculations indicate that \\nonly ammonia can form bicarbonate species, this signal is most probably due to the OH \\ngroups of glycerol involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonds. \\nThe 13C NMR spectra of the TEA-Gly mixture (3:1) before and after bubbling CO2 \\nfor 120 min are shown in Fig. 3. The signal assignments are described in Table 2. For non-\\nhydrogenated carbon atoms, the 1H NMR in 2D 1H-13C – Heteronuclear Multiple Bond \\nCorrelation (HMBC) spectra are shown in Fig. 4. \\nSignals at 45.7 and 11.5 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum of the TEA-Gly mixture \\n(3:1) were assigned to C4 and C5, respectively, of TEA [62,63]. C1 and C3 of glycerol \\nwere related to the signal with the highest intensity at 63.0 ppm. The signal at 72.3 ppm \\nwas attributed to C2 of glycerol [44].\\nThe 13C NMR results (Fig. 3) indicate that part of glycerol did not react with CO2, \\nresulting in a mixture of the product and the initial reagents. Carbon signals in the HMBC \\nspectra were assigned based on the literature data for a similar system, Fig. 4 [54,57].  The \\n13C NMR spectrum of TEA-Gly-CO2-120min (Fig. 3) shows signals at 38.1 and 10.5 ppm, \\n18\\nassigned to C4’ and C5’ of protonated TEA. These signals were assigned considering the \\ncorrelations between H4’ and H5’, shown in Fig. 4b. The signal at 67.4 ppm was attributed \\nto C1’/3’ of glycerol after reaction with CO2. This result, in addition to the signal at 166.7 \\nppm, due to the carbonyl of the carbonate, suggests the formation of monocarbonate [66]. \\nCarbonate and bicarbonate species cannot be distinguished in this spectrum because of the \\nfast proton transfer between them, in addition to the low intensity of the signal of the \\nquaternary carbon. The concentration of the carbonate product after dilution in DMSO-d6 \\nmay also influence the signal intensity [67,68]. Signals in the range of 131.6–128.4 ppm \\nwere associated with the carbon of CO2 dissolved in the medium [66].\\n (Insert Fig. 3)\\n(Insert Table 2)\\nFig. 4a shows the partial HMBC 2D NMR spectrum of TEA-Gly-CO2-120min. \\nThe spectrum shows the carbon signal at 166.7 ppm attributed to carbonate species exhibits \\na long-range correlation with H1’/3’ of glycerol at 3.29–3.40 ppm. A second correlation is \\nrelated to the hydrogen signal of glycerol O-H at 4.14–4.16 ppm. This result suggests that \\nthe product formed is a C-1’/3’ monocarbonate interacting via hydrogen bonds with the \\nremaining hydroxyl groups of glycerol [61].\\nThe partial HMBC 2D NMR spectrum of TEA-Gly-CO2-120min (Fig. 4b) shows a \\ncorrelation between H4’ and H5’ of protonated TEA at 1.30–1.39 and 0.84–0.88 ppm, \\n19\\nrespectively, with C4’ and C5’ (38.1 and 10.5 ppm respectively), confirming that \\nprotonation of the base after bubbling CO2 in the TEA-Gly mixture (3:1) resulted in an \\nupfield shift of these carbon signals. The signals at 22.1–29.7 ppm, which appeared after \\nprotonation of TEA, could not be assigned.\\n(Insert Fig. 4a-b)\\nFig. S5 shows the TGA curves of glycerol, TEA and the TEA-Gly mixture (3:1) \\nbefore and after bubbling CO2 for 60 and 120 min. In the TGA/DTA curves of TEA-Gly-\\nCO2-60min (Fig. 5a) and TEA-Gly-CO2-120min (Fig. 5b) there are two main weight \\nlosses accompanied by two exothermic events. One weight loss is for the decomposition of \\nglycerol, occurring in the range of 150–250 ºC. The second one, in the range of 80–150 ºC \\nfor TEA-Gly-CO2-60min (23.0 %) and TEA-Gly-CO2-120min (23.3%), is for CO2 \\ndesorption. These comparable weight losses indicate that increasing the reaction time did \\nnot significantly improve CO2 absorption in the TEA-Gly mixture. They correspond to 6.6 \\nmol of CO2 per kg of solvent (TEA-Gly-CO2-60min) and 6.9 mol of CO2 per kg of solvent \\n(TEA-Gly-CO2-120min), respectively. This suggests ca. 3:1 stoichiometric ratio between \\nCO2 and glycerol. However, the HMBC 2D NMR spectrum of TEA-Gly-CO2-120min \\nindicates that only monocarbonate species is formed. Most likely the excess of CO2 in the \\nTGA experiment comes from CO2 dissolved in the TEA-Gly mixture, as dissolved CO2 \\nwas also identified in the 13C NMR spectrum. For comparison purpose, a 30 % (w/w) \\nmonoethanolamine water solution has an absorption capacity of 3.0 mol CO2 per kg of \\nsolution [69]. A ternary system composed by choline chloride, Gly and 1,1,3,3-\\n20\\ntetramethylguanidine (TMG) shows an absorption capacity of 2.4 mol of CO2 per kg of \\nsolvent [70]. \\n (Insert Fig. 5a-b)\\n4. Conclusions\\nComputation of a ternary combination of CO2, glycerol and organic bases indicates \\nthat it is possible to select bases of intermediate strength which, instead of directly reacting \\nwith the CO2 to form carbamates, they would preferentially activate glycerol, favoring \\nformation of an organic carbonate. Particularly, we could identify that tertiary amines, such \\nas trimethylamine and triethylamine (TEA) are strong enough to activate glycerol for \\nreaction with CO2, while they are not strong enough to directly react with CO2. These bases \\ncan form an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the primary hydroxyl groups of glycerol, \\nincreasing the glycerol nucleophilicity and favoring the CO2 capture. In addition, our \\nresults suggest that these weaker bases (as compared with guanidine, TBD, and DBU) are \\nassociated with less exothermic and exergonic reactions, pointing towards an easier \\nreversible process (CO2 desorption).\\nThe CO2 absorption experiments in a mixture of TEA and glycerol showed the \\nformation of an organic carbonate, confirming the theoretical prediction. The amount of \\nabsorbed CO2 is 6.6 ((TEA-Gly-CO2-60min) and 6.9 ((TEA-Gly-CO2-120min) mol of \\nCO2 per kg of solvent. Experimental optimization, for example changing the base and \\n21\\nreducing the medium viscosity, may lead to the development of a promising system for \\nCO2 capture.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was financially supported by the Brazilian agencies National Council for \\nScientific and Technological Development (CNPq, grant numbers 309080/2015-0 and \\n434955/2018-3, Universal grant numbers 434141/2018-6 and 423086/2018-9, C.

        "Title": "'Multiphase carbon mineralization for \\nthe reactive separation of CO2 and \\ndirected synthesis of H2\\n'",
        "Abstract": "'Abstract | There is a need to capture, convert and store CO2 by atom-\\u200befficient and energy-\\u200b\\nefficient pathways that use as few process configurations as possible. This need has motivated \\nstudies into multiphase reaction chemistries and this Review describes two such approaches  \\nin the context of carbon mineralization. The first approach uses aqueous alkaline solutions \\ncontaining amine nucleophiles that capture CO2 and eventually convert it into calcium and \\nmagnesium carbonates, thereby regenerating the nucleophiles. Gas–liquid–solid and liquid–solid \\nconfigurations of these reactions are explored. The second approach combines silicates such as \\nCaSiO3 or Mg2SiO4 with CO and H2O from the water-\\u200bgas shift reaction to give H2 and calcium  \\nor magnesium carbonates. Coupling carbonate formation to the water-\\u200bgas shift reaction shifts \\nthe latter equilibrium to afford more H2 as part of a single-\\u200bstep catalytic approach to carbon \\nmineralization. These pathways exploit the vast abundance of alkaline resources, including \\nnaturally occurring silicates and alkaline industrial residues. However, simple stoichiometries \\nbelie the complex, multiphase nature of the reactions, predictive control of which presents  \\na scientific opportunity and challenge. This Review describes this multiphase chemistry and  \\nthe knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to achieve ‘step-\\u200bchange’ advancements in the \\nreactive separation of CO2 by carbon mineralization.\\nSchool of Civil and \\nEnvironmental Engineering, \\nCornell University, Ithaca,  \\nNY, USA.\\ne-\\u200bmail: gg464@cornell.edu\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/ \\ns41570-019-0158-3\\nREVIEWS\\nNature Reviews | Chemistry\\nSuch experiments raise the larger scientific question \\nof how we might design multiphase reaction pathways \\nto capture, convert and store CO2 in a single carbon-\\u200b\\nmineralization process. Conceptualizing chemical path-\\nways to address this question yields two approaches.  \\nIn the first approach, the low aqueous solubility of CO2 \\nis overcome by using a solution in which one or more \\nnucleophilic components has a high affinity for CO2 at \\nroom temperature. The resulting CO2-bearing solution \\nis basic and also contains Ca2+ or Mg2+ ions, such that \\ncalcium and magnesium carbonates precipitate. Thus, \\nthe CO2-binding molecules are regenerated chemically \\ninstead of thermally, whereby the CO2 adduct is heated \\nto isolate CO2. The aim of coupling these reactions is to \\nuse CO2 from flue gas streams (1\\u2009atm) to produce cal-\\ncium and magnesium carbonates at T <100\\u2009°C. In the \\nsecond approach, reactive separation of CO2 by carbon \\nmineralization is used for the directed synthesis of clean \\nenergy carriers, such as H2. Specifically, CO and H2O \\n(steam) undergo the water-\\u200bgas shift reaction (WGSR) to \\ngive H2 and CO2, with the latter going on to react with \\nCaSiO3 or Mg2SiO4 to give calcium and magnesium car-\\nbonates. This means of removing CO2 from the WGSR \\nmeans that the equilibrium shifts to afford more H2 \\n(Table\\xa01), which is ideally produced at temperatures in \\nthe range 150–250\\u2009°C in a single catalytic carbon miner-\\nalization pathway — an alternative to the two-step cata\\xad\\nlytic approach in which one stage requires 310–450\\u2009°C \\nand the other 200–250\\u2009°C17. Several minerals and rocks \\nhave been explored for carbon mineralization (Table\\xa02).\\nThis Review describes the multiphase chemical \\ntransformations underlying the two above approaches \\nand identifies the scientific knowledge gaps associated \\nwith chemistry at solid interfaces. Indeed, the extents \\nof carbon mineralization are often unpredictable, and \\nit is difficult to direct the synthesis of calcium or mag-\\nnesium carbonates with structural and morphological \\nspecificity and characterize chemo-\\u200bmorphological cou-\\npling in multiphase reaction environments. Addressing \\nthese challenges will allow us to develop technologies \\nthat are preferable to the conventional approach of \\nindependently developing separation media for CO2 \\ncapture, designing catalytic pathways for CO2 conver-\\nsion and optimizing CO2 storage in subsurface environ-\\nments. According to the National Academies of Sciences, \\nEngineering, and Medicine (2019)12, carbon minerali-\\nzation of Mg-\\u200bcontaining or Ca-\\u200bcontaining ultramafic \\n(basic, O2−/OH−-rich materials such as serpentine, \\n(Mg,Fe)3Si2O5(OH)4) tailings, alkaline industrial res-\\nidues, construction and demolition waste, municipal \\nsolid waste and naturally occurring minerals such as  \\nperidotite, all together, can offset up to 30\\u2009Gt CO2 per year.  \\nThese assessments are based on conventional carbon- \\nmineralization approaches, the costs of which must \\nbe lowered to enable large-\\u200bscale implementation. This \\nis what motivates the exploration of novel reactive-\\u200b\\nseparation pathways of CO2 that use alkaline residues \\nand naturally occurring minerals.\\nAlkaline-\\u200bamine looping in carbon mineralization\\nI now detail the rational design of multiphase chemical \\nreaction pathways involved in the first CO2 processing \\napproach, whereby aqueous nucleophiles — amines \\nbeing the most prominent — bind CO2 en route to the \\nformation of carbonates in basic solution. Described first \\nare the early studies that led to these amine technologies.\\nEarly research motivating the design of integrated reac-\\ntion pathways. The desirability of an integrated chemi\\xadcal \\npathway — a single reaction environment for the direct \\ncapture, conversion and storage of CO2 as calcium or \\nmagnesium carbonates — led to the exploration of chemi\\xad\\ncally regenerable solvents containing amine or amino-\\u200b\\nacid groups that bind CO2.

Thus, \\neach sequential reaction step in low-\\u200btemperature carbon \\nmineralization can be tuned by adding reagents and \\nmaking the necessary pH adjustments. However, at the \\ntime, there was limited understanding of the energetics \\nassociated with using these reagents and the regeneration \\nefficiency. Accordingly, there has been a lot of research \\nconducted on chemically regenerable amine-\\u200bbearing or \\namino-acid-bearing solvents for integrated CO2 capture,  \\nconversion and storage.\\nCO2 capture with aqueous amines or amino acids. \\nAqueous solutions of amines can efficiently capture CO2 \\nat temperatures in the range 40–60\\u2009°C (ref.28). These CO2-\\nloaded solutions are regenerated at 120–140\\u2009°C to liber-\\nate high-purity CO2 (ref.28). The widespread use of these \\nsolutions and continued interest in novel solvents and \\nmixtures is motivated by their fast kinetics and ease of \\nregeneration29,30. The CO2 capture mechanism, capacity \\nand regeneration efficiency depend on the structure of \\nthe amine. For example, in terms of theoretical capacity, \\ntwo primary or secondary amine molecules are needed \\nto capture one CO2 molecule in the form of a carbamate \\n(with some ending up as HCO3\\n−)31. Tertiary amines and \\nsterically bulky secondary amines act as Brønsted rather \\nthan Lewis bases, and only one molecule of amine is \\nstoichiometrically required to capture CO2 and afford \\nHCO3\\n− and CO3\\n2− hydrolysis products31. Relative to pri-\\nmary and secondary amines, tertiary and cyclic amines \\nare more chemically and thermally stable31.\\nThe environmental problem with using amine-\\u200b\\nbearing solvents for CO2 capture is that their thermal \\nand chemical degradation affords harmful products, \\nsuch as nitrosamines, nitramines and ammonia31–38. \\nIndeed, many amines are not 100% regenerable from \\ntheir carbamate/bicarbonate forms, and their degrada-\\ntion products corrode carbon-\\u200bsteel infrastructure for \\nCO2 capture39–43. This led some to study amine mix-\\ntures to optimize CO2 capture and mineralization44,45 \\nor, preferably, the use of environmentally benign and \\nstable alternatives such as amino-\\u200bacid salts46–60 (Fig.\\xa01). \\nIndeed, potassium and sodium glycinate have faster \\nCO2-binding kinetics, lower binding energies, lower \\nvapour pressures, greater thermal stabilities and superior \\nO2 resistances relative to ethanolamine derivatives51,53,54. \\nGlycine reacts with CO2 to generate the correspond-\\ning carbamic acid, which is deprotonated by a second \\nequivalent of glycinate to produce the corresponding \\ncarbamate and zwitterionic glycine55. The carbamate \\nundergoes hydrolysis to afford glycinate and HCO3\\n− \\nions55. Not all amino-\\u200bacid salts are suitable for carbon \\nmineralization. For example, potassium sarcosinate \\n((methylamino)acetate) precipitates from aqueous solu-\\ntion on capturing CO2 (refs56–60) and is unsuitable as a \\nCO2 absorbent because the precipitate cannot quickly \\ncombine with the M2+ ions and base to give calcium or \\nmagnesium carbonates. Indeed, when using absorbents \\nin an alkaline aqueous phase to capture CO2 and release \\nit by chemical regeneration, the objective is to precipitate \\nonly calcium or magnesium carbonates while maintain-\\ning the CO2-binding nucleophile in the aqueous phase. \\nAside from capacity for CO2 and solubility of adducts, \\nseveral other criteria need to be considered when evalu-\\nating amine bases for carbon mineralization. Desirable \\nattributes for integrated CO2 capture, conversion and \\nstorage by carbon mineralization include the retention \\nof flowability without enhanced viscosity on CO2 capture \\nand regeneration, retention of activity through multiple \\ncycles of carbon mineralization, negligible generation of  \\nnon-\\u200bcarbonate precipitates as end products and ease  \\nof chemical regeneration by carbon mineralization.\\nIntegrated pathways for CO2 absorption and carbonate \\ncrystallization. Let us first consider CO2 absorption in the \\nabsence of an amine base. Carbon mineralization in natu\\xad\\nral systems often occurs over timescales of several years,  \\nand efforts to engineer this to occur over a few hours can \\ngo two ways. In one method, introducing CO2 (139\\u2009atm) \\ninto aqueous NaCl (1.0\\u2009M) and NaHCO3 (0.64\\u2009M) with \\n15\\u2009wt% Mg2SiO4 at temperatures up to 185\\u2009°C yielded \\n85% conversion in a single 3-h step9. As described above, \\nelevated p(CO2) aids dissolution into the aqueous phase, \\nwhile elevated T favours the kinetics of Mg2SiO4 disso-\\nlution61,62 and MgCO3 precipitation15,16. Analogously, \\nwhen CO2 (40\\u2009atm) is added to a mixture at 100\\u2009°C that \\ncontains CaSiO3 instead of Mg2SiO4, one observes com-\\nplete conversion into CaCO3 over the same period8. Life-\\u200b\\ncycle assessments show that, after accounting for energy \\nrequirements, substantial amounts of CO2 are seques-\\ntered using these pathways63. The second approach \\ninvolves dissolving the Ca-bearing and Mg-bearing \\nminerals to extract Ca2+ and Mg2+ into the aqueous \\nphase using strong acids, after which the pH must be \\nraised to above 9 before bubbling CO2 in to precipitate \\ncalcium or magnesium carbonates64–66.

However, the recycling efficiency of the \\naqueous amine solution was not quantified46. After this \\nstudy, it was found that aqueous solutions of CO2-loaded \\namines such as MEA (Fig.\\xa01), diethanolamine (DEA), \\npiperazine (PZ), 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) \\nand methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) enable complete \\nconversion of CaO into CaCO3 at 40\\u2009°C. PZ absorbed \\nthe most CO2 and exhibited the greatest regeneration \\nefficiency on a molar basis of amines — the percentage \\nof CO2-loaded absorbent converted back to the base on \\nmineralization47. The regeneration energy of PZ is lower \\nbecause it acts by coupling absorption and mineraliza-\\ntion, which contrasts the conventional thermal regen-\\neration of amines68. Similarly, CaCl2 solutions undergo \\ncomplete conversion into CaCO3 when combined with \\nCO2-loaded MEA, AMP or MDEA49. MEA, DEA and \\nMDEA favoured the formation of calcite (rhombohedral \\nCaCO3), while using AMP gave calcite, as well as the \\nhexagonal polymorph vaterite49.\\nThe carbon-\\u200bmineralization studies described above \\nused CO2-loaded amines in liquid–solid environments47, \\nas opposed to more realistic gas–liquid–solid environ-\\nments featuring CO2-containing flue gas. Recent stud-\\nies using CO2 gas, an amine-bearing solution and a \\nCa-bearing or Mg-bearing alkaline substrate show that \\none can directly use the gas and still have rapid carbon \\nmineralization with regeneration of the amine (Fig.\\xa02). \\nFor example, under CO2 (1\\u2009atm), one can vary the iden-\\ntity of the alkaline solid (15\\u2009wt% CaO69, CaSiO3 (ref.69) or \\nMgO70 in H2O) and the MEA concentration (0–50\\u2009wt%) \\nto study the effects on carbonate formation. In the case \\nof CaO and CaSiO3, the presence of MEA greatly accel-\\nerates mineralization69 (Fig.\\xa03a). Aqueous suspensions \\nof MgO with 50\\u2009wt% MEA afforded a gel-\\u200blike phase \\nunder CO2 that limited mass transfer and lowered the \\nextent of carbon mineralization70. The composition of \\nthe gel phase was not anticipated and mechanisms by \\nwhich these phases form are not well understood. The \\nformation of gels as a potential rate-\\u200blimiting step needs \\nmore detailed investigation. Each alkaline solid under-\\ngoes single-step carbon mineralization most readily at \\n50\\u2009°C (Fig.\\xa03b) — a moderate temperature amenable to \\nCO2 dissolution. Another parameter of amine-catalysed \\ncarbon mineralization is the enthalpy of the reaction, \\nand further studies should explore this parameter to \\ninform a more rational selection of amine. Nevertheless, \\nthese results show that CO2 solvation, dissolution of the \\nalkaline solids and carbonate precipitation can be cou-\\npled in a single gas–liquid–solid reaction environment, \\npresenting the possibility of an integrated pathway that \\ncan be coupled to point sources of CO2 or to an existing \\nCO2-capture plant that utilizes amine-bearing solvents.\\nThe nature of the alkaline solid affects which carbonate \\nphase forms.

Scalable H2 production first involves gasi\\xad\\nfication, whereby organic feedstocks such as carbona-\\nceous fuels or non-\\u200brecyclable plastics are reacted under \\nO2 or steam to produce CO, H2 and CO2 (ref.76).

Contrarily, other studies have suggested \\nthat reactions performed with slow flow rates see the  \\nprecipitation of secondary-reaction-limiting phases, \\nsuch as SiO2\\n109.\\nAside from the contrasting timescales of the pro-\\ncesses involved in carbon mineralization, one must also \\nconsider competing precipitation reactions, particularly \\nwhen multi-\\u200bmineral alkaline resources such as industrial \\nresidues are used. When starting with Ca-\\u200bbearing and \\nMg-\\u200bbearing rocks such as anorthosite and basalt as the \\nalkaline precursors101, carbon mineralization is hindered by  \\nthe precipitation of Mg-\\u200bbearing clays. For example, Mg2+ \\nions preferentially end up in Mg-\\u200bbearing clays as opposed \\nto the targeted magnesium carbonate phases, and the clay \\nprecipitates can contribute to mass-\\u200btransfer-limiting pas-\\nsivation behaviour. We must also consider the amines used \\nto capture and transfer CO2, which can be degraded by  \\nimpurities such as SOx or NOx and by thermal cycling at  \\nhigh temperatures. Despite the sensitivity of amines, the \\ninfluence of impurities on\\xa0the performance of amines in  \\nprocessing CO2 to give Ca-bearing and Mg-\\u200bbearing  \\ncarbonate precipitates is not well understood.\\nIt is important to distinguish the formation of car-\\nbonate phases and secondary phases including SiO2, \\na task that is, nowadays, often achieved using high-\\u200b\\nresolution scanning electron microscopy, transmission \\nelectron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. \\nLikewise, to understand the growth of crystalline phases \\nat solid interfaces, we turn to in operando grazing-\\u200b\\nincidence small-\\u200bangle X-\\u200bray scattering (GI-\\u200bSAXS)110,111. \\nLastly, to probe fluid-\\u200bdriven changes on solid interfaces, \\nwe can use in\\xa0situ sum-\\u200bfrequency vibrational spectros-\\ncopy112 and ambient-\\u200bpressure X-\\u200bray photoelectron spec-\\ntroscopy113, methods that have benefited from recent \\nadvancements. A more detailed description of analytical \\ntools is given in a later section.\\nDirecting synthesis of CaCO3 and MgCO3 with struc-\\ntural and morphological specificity. The complexity  \\nof multiphase reactions contributes to the challenge of  \\nproducing CaCO3 and MgCO3 with structural and  \\nmorphological specificity. Differences in fluid saturation \\nand chemical composition, chemistry and morphology \\nof the solid alkaline precursor, as well as temperature \\nand flow conditions, influence the emergence of sin-\\ngle or multiple crystalline phases. For example, carbon \\nmineralization by looping with alkaline MEA solution \\nconverts CaO to calcite, vaterite and aragonite as the \\ncarbonate phases, while precursors such as CaCl2 yield \\ncalcite alone49. Under similar experimental conditions, \\nstarting with MgO results in metastable hydrated phases \\nMgCO3·xH2O59. The higher likelihood of producing \\nstable CaCO3 as opposed to MgCO3 is attributed to the \\nlower charge density and less stable hydration spheres \\nof Ca2+ ions compared with Mg2+ ions — the enhanced \\nlability of Ca2+ helps the formation of the thermo\\xad\\ndynamic product (as noted above, CaCO3 precipitation \\nrates are about six orders of magnitude greater than \\nMgCO3)53,114. One suggested approach to disrupting \\nthe stable hydration shell of Mg2+ ions is to direct the \\nsynthesis of MgCO3 at room temperature with poly-\\nstyrene microspheres featuring carboxylate groups115. \\nThese carboxylate groups disrupt the hydration shell \\nand allow for the Mg2+ to bind to the carbonate species.\\nThis approach lowers kinetic barriers for carbonate \\nformation115. Such innovative approaches allow us to \\nexplore the feasibility of directing the synthesis of stable \\ncarbonate phases in ‘realistic’ multiphase environments \\ncomprising multiple ionic species.\\nBeing Brønsted bases, it will not come as a surprise \\nthat the formation of solid carbonates is pH depend-\\nent. In the case of Ca2+, when pH >12, one observes \\nthe formation of stable calcite phases, with metastable \\naragonite and vaterite being favoured at pH ~11 and \\npH <10, respectively116,117. The phase obtained also \\ndepends on where it grows and, in amorphous cylin-\\ndrical pores of track-\\u200betch membranes, one can observe \\namorphous CaCO3 converting into rod-\\u200bshaped single \\ncalcite crystals118. In contrast, crosslinked gelatin films \\ncontaining peptides such as poly(l-\\u200baspartate) and \\npoly(l-\\u200bglutamate) template the synthesis of metasta-\\nble vaterite119, as does mixing CaCl2 and urea (a CO3\\n2− \\nsource) in the presence of solvents such as ethylene \\nglycol, 1,2-propanediol and glycerol at temperatures in \\nthe range 80–190\\u2009°C (ref.120). Instead, metastable arago-\\nnite can be synthesized by ultrasonication of Ca(HCO3)2 \\n(ref.121) using reverse surfactant microemulsions122 or \\nself-\\u200bassembled monolayers as substrates123 or by diffu-\\nsion of CO2 into a solution of CaCl2 mixed with par-\\nticles of a hydrophilic triblock copolymer. The latter \\nprocess mimics biomineralization124 of aragonite and, \\naside from using synthetic poly\\xadmers, it is also possible \\nto use biopolymers (proteins) to direct the formation \\nof the metastable aragonite product125–128. Hydrophilic, \\naspartic-\\u200bacid-rich macromolecules on the surfaces  \\nof shells have been known to influence the formation of \\naragonite125. Understanding these biomacromolecular \\ninfluences on the directed synthesis of aragonite phases \\nmay allow us to develop advanced insights into the use \\nof similar molecules for the reactive separation of CO2 \\nvia carbonate formation.\\nWith respect to carbon mineralization using Mg2+-\\ncontaining materials, under ambient temperature and \\npressure, one obtains hydrated MgCO3 phases such as \\nMgCO3·3H2O129–133, and only subsequent heating affords \\nanhydrous MgCO3 (magnesite) as the thermodynamic \\nproduct134. Indeed, hydrothermal environments (high \\nT, p(CO2) and salinity) accelerate the conversion of \\nhydrated and metastable MgCO3·xH2O species into \\nstable magnesite27,130,135,136. It is, thus, possible to selec-\\ntively make a carbonate phase by starting with materi-\\nals of known morphologies and fluid environments of \\nknown compositions. However, when carbon mineral-\\nization occurs in multiphase chemical environments, \\nit becomes challenging to predict which carbonate \\nphase will form. Thus, if we are to generate H2 from the \\nWGSR by the present carbon-\\u200bmineralization method, \\nwe need a detailed understanding of how the multiple \\nand different solid interfaces influence the growth of \\ncarbonate phases. For example, as mentioned above, \\ncarbonate growth on MgCO3 is favoured over Mg(OH)2 \\ndue to higher self-\\u200badhesion and larger misfit between \\nthe two phases71. In systems starting with Mg2SiO4  \\nand/or CaSiO3, we must consider how the SiO2-bearing \\nwww.nature.com/natrevchem\\nReviews\\nco-\\u200bproduct surfaces and their evolving porosity will \\naffect the synthesis of carbonate phases. For exam-\\nple, experiments using nanoporous, amorphous SiO2 \\nallow one to study how coating the pores with a self-\\u200b\\nassembled monolayer of organic groups with pen-\\ndant anhydrides (which, like carboxylates, bind metal \\nions\\xa0and accelerate mineralization) affects the pore \\nsizes in which calcite chooses to crystallize137. Being \\nnow aware of the need to identify the evolving and \\ntransient nature of the solid interfaces and the fluidic \\nenvironment, let us turn our attention to in operando \\ncharacterization\\xa0approaches.\\nCharacterizing chemo-\\u200bmorphological coupling in multi\\xad\\nphase reaction environments. Identifying and tuning \\nthe rate-\\u200blimiting steps is essential for any chemical \\nprocess and the same goes for designing multiphase \\nchemical reaction pathways for reactive separation of \\nCO2 and directed synthesis of clean energy carriers. \\nThe conventional approach of inferring underlying \\nmechanisms from bulk kinetics measurements does \\nnot enable direct characterization of transient species \\nand the transformations that give metastable or stable \\nphases. I have, so far, discussed the chemistry at play \\nbut have not described many of the analytical tools \\nrequired to arrive at these conclusions. It turns out that \\nadvancements in cross-\\u200bscale synchrotron characteriza-\\ntion techniques now allow us to probe the structural \\nand microstructural changes in materials from the sub-\\u200b\\nnanometre to the micrometre scales (Fig.\\xa07). These X-\\u200bray \\ntechniques, in conjunction with neutron scattering and \\nmicroscopy, afford us many capabilities. For example, \\nrecent advancements in ultrafast simultaneous char-\\nacterization of structure and microstructure from the \\nsub-\\u200bnanometre to micrometre scales in less than 3\\u2009min \\nusing synchrotron ultra-\\u200bsmall-angle, small-\\u200bangle and \\nwide-\\u200bangle X-\\u200bray scattering (USAXS/SAXS/WAXS) \\nmeasurements allow us to follow rapid kinetics over \\nfour orders of magnitude in space138–141. Local structural \\nchanges associated with Ca2+ and Mg2+ coordination in \\nsolid samples due to the presence of various aqueous \\nsolvents142–147 are conveniently probed using X-\\u200bray \\nabsorption spectroscopy. The influence of surface chem-\\nistry and morphology on the nucleation and growth \\nof carbonate phases under reaction conditions can be \\nevaluated using GI-\\u200bSAXS. Collectively, total scattering, \\nX-\\u200bray absorption spectroscopy and GI-\\u200bSAXS measure-\\nments can explain why hydrated phases MgCO3·xH2O \\nare favoured at temperatures below 100\\u2009°C, while anhy-\\ndrous MgCO3 is formed at higher temperatures. Atom-\\u200b\\nefficient utilization of silicate-\\u200bbearing resources calls for \\nexploring the chemical and morphological fate of SiO2 \\nin relation to its influence in limiting or enhancing the \\nreactivity of Ca-\\u200bbearing or Mg-\\u200bbearing minerals. These \\ninsights will be developed by probing reacted interfacial \\nstructures using in\\xa0situ X-\\u200bray reflectivity, crystal trunca-\\ntion rod measurements and layer-\\u200bby-layer evolution in \\nthe morphology and thickness of SiO2 layers as deter-\\nmined using atomic force microscopy and transmission \\nelectron microscopy. The evolution of the pore–solid \\nnetworks and its dynamic influence on reactivity are \\nbest imaged using in operando microtomography \\nand USAXS/SAXS. Lastly, to simultaneously evaluate \\nchanges in the solid-\\u200bstate chemistry, morphology and \\nfluid composition, we need novel, multiphase reactors \\ncompatible with synchrotron measurements of the solid \\nenvironment, as well as with online gas chromatogra-\\nphy and mass spectrometry.

Integrated single-\\u200bstep \\npathways of CO2 capture and conversion pathways have \\nconventionally been explored for the synthesis of organic \\nchemicals142,143. In this Review, we discuss cohesive and \\nrational approaches to design reaction pathways for the \\ncapture and conversion of CO2 into inorganic calcium \\nand magnesium carbonates, and the directed synthesis \\nof H2. The thermodynamically downhill nature of car-\\nbon mineralization can only be exploited with kineti-\\ncally accessible reaction pathways. In one approach, the \\nuse of nucleophiles such as amines or amino-\\u200bacid salts \\nallows us to overcome challenges associated with the \\nlow solubility of CO2 in the aqueous phase. High con-\\ncentrations of dissolved carbonate aid the precipitation \\nof calcium and magnesium carbonates at temperatures \\nbelow 50\\u2009°C. The regeneration of the amine or amino-\\u200b\\nacid nucleophile accompanies carbonate precipitation \\nand allows reuse of the aqueous medium. In another \\ndistinct approach, the feasibility of achieving high \\nconversions of CaSiO3 and Mg2SiO4 into calcium and \\nmagnesium carbonates under conditions that favour the \\nWGSR allows us to couple these reactions to the directed \\nsynthesis of H2 with the capture of CO2. Older studies \\nexplored the use of oxides and hydroxides of Ca and \\nMg as alkaline sources to trap CO2 and accompany H2 \\nsynthesis. More recent work exploits the high reactiv-\\nity of CaSiO3 and Mg2SiO4 under relevant experimental \\nconditions to demonstrate the promising potential for \\nusing these earth-\\u200babundant minerals. To broaden the \\nscope of these reaction pathways to incorporate a wide \\nrange of alkaline feedstocks with varying chemistries, we \\nrequire improvements of present in operando spectros-\\ncopy and scattering characterization methods to develop \\nthe interfacial chemical basis for the observed structures \\nand morphologies of carbonates. This will allow us to \\nunravel the mechanisms operative in multiphase reac-\\ntion pathways and, in the present case, enable atom-\\u200b\\nefficient and energy-\\u200befficient capture, conversion and \\nstorage of CO2 and the directed synthesis of H2, along \\nwith the formation of CaCO3 or MgCO3.\\nPublished online xx xx xxxx\\n1.\\t\\nKelemen, P.

        "Title": "'CO2 Absorption from Gas Turbine Flue Gas by Aqueous Piperazine\\nwith Intercooling\\n'",
        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: Amine scrubbing is the most mature technology for postcombustion\\ncarbon capture. Much bench- and pilot-scale work has been focused on CO2\\ncapture from coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. Because natural gas is inexpensive and readily\\navailable in the United States and other countries, the natural gas combined-cycle\\n(NGCC) has been replacing coal for electricity generation. Carbon capture for\\nNGCC is therefore an important technology for the modern power plants. The\\nPiperazine (PZ) Advanced Stripper (PZAS) technology has been established as a\\nbenchmark system for second-generation amine scrubbing for CO2 capture from\\ncoal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. It has a fast absorption rate, good energy performance, and\\nstrong resistance to thermal degradation and oxidation. PZAS was operated with\\nsimulated NGCC ﬂue gas (4.3 mol % (dry) CO2) at the National Carbon Capture\\nCenter (NCCC) in Wilsonville, Alabama in 2019. This paper presents the absorber\\nperformance and model validation for the campaign. The absorber was tested with\\nin-and-out and with pump-around intercooling. The variable operating conditions\\nincluded lean loading (0.19−0.25 m CO2/mol alkalinity), gas temperature (40, 78 °C), and intercooling temperature (35, 40\\n°C). Using 5 m PZ CO2 removal from 82% to 96% was achieved with intercooling and only 12 m of packing. A rigorous, rate-\\nbased absorber model accurately predicted the CO2 removal and temperature proﬁle. The model shows that the delta loading of\\nthe solvent at NGCC conditions for 90% removal is greater than at coal conditions, but high CO2 removal (99%) is more\\ndiﬃcult to achieve with NGCC gas than with coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. The pump-around intercooling was eﬀective, and the\\nintercooling temperature had a large impact on the absorber performance. With pump-around, the delta loading penalty for hot\\ngas feed into absorber without a direct contact cooler was less than 5%.'"

        "Abstract": "'A B S T R A C T\\nThe amine blends as the potential carbon dioxide (CO2) capture absorbents have been received much attention in\\nrecent years, but this amines interaction mechanism remains unclear. In the present work, the kinetics of CO2\\nabsorption into aqueous solutions of a secondary amine (Ethylethanolamine, EAE), a tertiary amine (1-\\nDimethylamino-2-propanol, 1DMA2P) and their blend were investigated by using a stopped-ﬂow setup. The\\nkinetic data of aqueous EAE solution can be interpreted well by the zwitterion mechanism, and the reaction rate\\nof 1DMA2P can be ﬁtted well using the base-catalyzed hydration mechanism. Experimental results showed that\\nthe pseudo ﬁrst-order rate constants (k0) of EAE/1DMA2P is much higher than the calculated values of in-\\ndividual EAE and 1DMA2P using the parallel reaction mechanism. It has been accepted that the tertiary amine\\n(i.e. 1DMA2P) can attract the CO2 from the zwitterion to release the free EAE molecules or the 1DMA2P as a base\\njoin the reaction of the CO2 and EAE. Then, the reaction pathway was proposed and the kinetic model with\\nacceptable AARD% values of 6.642 was developed. Therefore, it can be concluded that the addition of EAE into\\n1DMA2P with low energy consumption can importantly enhance the absorption performance to solve the\\ncontradiction between low absorption heats and high CO2 absorption rates.'"

The selected engine for the study\\nis an M936G, widely used in freight and passenger transport. A primary and a tertiary amine were\\nchosen for the simulations.

The comparison\\nhighlights that a combined cycle integrated with MCFCs looks the most attractive technology, both in\\nterms of energy penalty and economics, i.e., CO2 avoided cost of 49 $/tCO2 avoided, and the speciﬁc\\nprimary energy consumption per unit of CO2 avoided (SPECCA) equal to 0.31 MJLHV/kgCO2 avoided.\\nThe second-best capture technology is PZ scrubbing (SPECCA = 2.73 MJLHV/kgCO2 avoided and\\ncost of CO2 avoided = 68 $/tCO2 avoided), followed by the monoethanolamine (MEA) base case\\n(SPECCA = 3.34 MJLHV/kgCO2 avoided and cost of CO2 avoided = 75 $/tCO2 avoided), and the\\nsupersonic ﬂow driven CO2 anti-sublimation and inertial separation system and CO2 permeable\\nmembranes.

Here, we present classical\\nand first-principles molecular dynamics results on CO2 capture at the\\ngas/amine solution interfaces using solvents of diﬀerent polarities.\\nEven if it is apolar, carbon dioxide is absorbed at the gas/\\nmonoethanolamine (MEA) aqueous solution interface, forming\\nstable and interfacial [CO2·MEA] complexes, which are the ﬁrst\\nreaction intermediate toward the chemical conversion of CO2 to\\ncarbamate ions. We report that the stability of the interfacial [CO2·\\nMEA] precomplex depends on the nature and polarity of the\\nsolution, as well as on the conformer population of MEA. By changing the polarity of the solvent, using chloroform, we observed a\\nshift in the interfacial MEA population toward conformers that form more stable [CO2·MEA] complexes and, at the same time, a\\nfurther stabilization of the complex induced by the solvent environment. Thus, while lowering the polarity of the solvent could\\ndecrease the solubility of MEA, at the same time, it favors conformers that are more prone to CO2 capture and mineralization.

Absorption performance is significantly affected\\nby the molecular structure and water concentration in the amine solution. The absorption performance\\nof the MDEA system is better than that of TEA, which is basically ascribed to the MDEA molecule’s\\nmore asymmetric and irregular shape than that of TEA, which thus enhances the catalytic activity of\\nMDEA and the reactivity of the −OH moiety in water. The difference of electrical properties such as\\nionic conductivities (ICs) of the two protonated amines and real ionic activity coefficients (RIAC)\\nbetween the two systems might be also caused by the different molecular structures of the two amines.\\nThe IC of protonated MDEA is estimated to be 23.70% higher than that of protonated TEA, because of\\nthe higher ionic mobility and charge density of MDEA. The RIAC of the MDEA system is higher than that\\nof TEA, which is explained by the different physicochemical interactions between the molecules in the\\ntwo systems. Since water is one of the reactants in the absorption, its concentration in solution\\nsignificantly affects the results of the systems.

        "Abstract": "'Abstract \\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) is an important technology to reduce CO2 emissions from power and industry. \\nTo accelerate large-scale CCS deployment, further reduction of the cost to implement the full technology chain \\nis necessary. Full chain CCS cost depends on multiple technological, market, and societal factors. Therefore, \\ncase-specific cost analysis is important. This study estimates the CCS cost in Japan, which can be considered as \\na case study for specific countries where offshore sites are more suitable for CO2 storage than onshore sites \\nregarding geological reasons and barrier reduction of public/political acceptance. With the phasedown of \\nunabated coal power, retrofitting amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture system is a realistic way for \\npulverized coal-fired power plants. Capture cost was determined by the process simulation of coal-fired power \\nplant retrofits. Current political realities in Japan suggest that CO2 transport will be done by ship. Transport cost \\nwas estimated via a bottom-up analysis of each sub-process. Injection and monitoring cost was based on the \\nvalues reported by the Tomakomai demonstration project, which are applicable to onshore injection into an \\noffshore storage site. We find the full chain CCS cost to be 99–111 USD/t-CO2. Though changing the solution \\nin the CO2 capture process from monoethanolamine to the blend of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and piperazine \\nreduces the regeneration energy by 0.85 GJ/t-CO2, the CCS cost was only reduced by ~9 USD/t-CO2. Likewise, \\neven when the regeneration energy was reduced to 2.0 GJ/t-CO2 using a hypothetical amine solution embedded \\nin a highly optimized PCC system, the CCS cost was still ~93 USD/t-CO2. Considering that capital expenditure \\naccounts for ~65% of capture cost, downsizing capture facilities may provide further cost reduction. Since \\ntransport and storage costs were roughly equivalent to capture costs, full chain CCS implementation is likely \\nnecessary to reduce costs through learning-by-doing, scale-out, and market effects. \\nKeywords : Economic analysis, Chemical absorption, Carbon neutral, Rate-based simulation, CO2 avoided cost \\n \\n© The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers\\ncarbon price) is less than the cost of implementing CCS, then no company can be expected to choose the later. While \\ncarbon prices have climbed recently (Intercontinental Exchange, 2021), increasing the cost of polluting relative to the \\ncost of CCS through research and development will only help to expedite CO2 emissions reductions. The cost structure \\nof CCS contains capital costs (CAPEX) and operating costs (OPEX) which are determined by the mix of technologies \\nused to create the CCS chain, case-specific engineering decisions (e.g., CO2 capture rate, CO2 transport mass flow rate), \\nand factors outside of the control of engineers (e.g., fuel price). As such, the full chain CCS cost should be evaluated at \\na national to regional-level, accounting for engineering, geographical, and political realities at a minimum. \\nDespite the inherent requirement of transport and storage to realize CO2 emissions reductions, many cost analyses \\nof CCS seem to focus only on the CO2 capture process (Abu-Zahra et al., 2007; Feron et al., 2020) or assume simplified \\ntransport and storage costs without analysis of the interdependence between the subprocesses (Zoelle et al., 2015; GCCSI, \\n2017). Such analyses often assume particularly cheap transport and storage costs (e.g., 7–11 USD/t-CO2); this reduces \\nthe full chain CCS cost and makes the capture cost appear relatively important. Recently, this discrepancy in the quality \\nand depth of cost analysis has become apparent with more detailed, bottom-up analyses such as Psarras et al. (2020) \\nfinding that CCS cost is highly-dependent on the transportation mode, transportation distance, and storage methodology. \\nEven with these promising improvements in full chain CCS analysis, there remains a dearth of case-specific cost analyses \\nfor CCS with offshore transport and storage. \\nThis study estimates the cost of full chain CCS in Japan as a model case of countries without geologically or \\npolitically viable onshore CO2 transport or storage sites. In the capture process, CO2 removal from supercritical coal-\\nfired pulverized power plant (PCPP) via chemical absorption using aqueous amine solutions is considered. In Japan, \\nPCPP are the largest CO2 emission source in power sector and represent a large risk of stranded assets in the face of \\nJapan’s net zero emissions pledge. Given the write-down of nuclear power assets following the Fukushima Daiichi \\nnuclear accident, power companies will have difficulty in absorbing a complete shuttering of PCPP units. Being the most \\nmature post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) technology, amine-based chemical absorption is chosen for evaluation. In \\nthe research field of amine-based PCC, much effort has been put into developing new amine and its blends to reduce the \\nregeneration energy in the PCC process (Feron et al., 2020). We take this bottom-up analysis as an opportunity to assess \\nthe influence of the regeneration energy on the cost of full chain CCS. We evaluate a PCC system using the old-school \\ngold standard amine solution (i.e., 30wt% monoethanolamine: MEA) and the new-school gold-standard (i.e., 27wt% 2-\\namino-2-methyl-1-propanol and 13wt% piperazine: AMP-PZ) (Feron et al., 2020). We further include evaluation of a \\nhypothetical PCC system which can almost achieve the thermodynamically minimum regeneration energy. \\n \\n2. Methods \\n2.1 Assumed CCS chain \\nFigure 1a), b), and c) provides a map of thermal power plants and potential storage area in Japan (Ministry of the \\nEnvironment, 2021a). Though this analysis focuses on PCPP, CO2 storage sites are likely to be shared between emitters; \\ntherefore, proximity to the aggregate of major point source emitters is likely to influence where CO2 storage occurs. As \\nshown in Fig. 1a), most of thermal power plants are located near coastlines but remote from potential subseafloor storage \\nsites. Japanese law requires approval from each prefecture for the construction and operation of a pipeline (METI, 2021b). \\nThe seismically active nature of Japan suppresses positive pipeline construction in comparison with the central US, \\nCanada, and Australia (Baroudi et al., 2021). The relative lack of pipelines in Japan may to some degree be explained by \\nthese political and geological realities. Taking these into account, we have selected shipping as a practical option to \\ntransport CO2 in Japan. Note that the coastlines are highly complicated and that many gulfs or islands are scattered as \\nshown in Fig. 1b) and c), making the ships meander. \\n© The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers\\n \\nFig. 1a) Map of thermal power plants in Japan (dots) and potential storage areas (blue regions), b) the enlarged view of the \\nnorthern Kyushu, Setouchi, and western Kansai area represented as ‘*’ in Fig. 1a), and c) the enlarged view of southern Kanto \\narea represented as ‘**’ in Fig. 1a). \\n \\nFigure 2 shows the technologies chosen to create the CCS chain in this study. The logic supporting PCPP as the \\nemission source was provided in section 1. Given the recent trends of project cancelation for new build coal-based power \\nand the need to firm the grid against a growing share of renewable energy sources (METI, 2021a), we have selected \\nPCPP retrofitted with PCC as a potential CCS pathway in Japan. It was assumed that the captured CO2 from the PCC \\nfacility is non-pressurized and is sent to the onshore ‘export terminal’ of captured CO2 via a short-distance onshore \\npipeline. The export terminal consists of a liquefaction plant, an intermediate storage tank, and facilities for loading CO2 \\nonto ships, and its capacity is 5.67 million tonnes per year in accordance with the PCPP capacity. As a baseline scenario, \\ntransport distance between the export terminal and the onshore ‘import terminal’ of transported CO2 was set to be 1,000 \\nkm. The import terminal consists of equipment to unload CO2 from ships, an intermediate storage tank, a CO2 \\nconditioning facility, and a CO2 injection facility with multiple injection wells, and its capacity is the same as the export \\nterminal. The CO2 injection was assumed to be operated onshore into a subseafloor geological formation as demonstrated \\nin the JCCS Tomakomai project (METI, 2020). In the following sections, cost estimation methodology for CO2 capture, \\ntransport, and storage are explained in detail. \\n \\n \\nFig. 2 CCS chain used in this study. \\n© The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers\\n2.2 CO2 capture method and cost \\n \\nThe CO2 capture cost was calculated from the cost of electricity (COE) with and without retrofit PCC. To estimate \\nthe COE and CO2 capture cost, process performance indices (e.g., fuel consumption rate, gross power output, and \\nauxiliary load) were needed. These results were obtained using the commercial process simulator Aspen Plus® along with \\nseveral auxiliary power estimation referencing Zoelle et al. (2015). \\n \\n2.2.1 PCPP configuration and modelling \\n \\nUsing the commercial process simulator Aspen Plus®, a model of a 1,000 MW net power output PCPP without PCC \\nwas developed based on the report of the US DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) (Zoelle et al., 2015). \\nThe PCPP model consists of several sub-processes: boiler, steam turbines, condenser, feedwater system, selective \\ncatalytic reduction (SCR), baghouse, flue gas desulfurization (FGD), and boiler feed pump turbine drives (BFPTD). \\nFigure 3a) shows the process flow diagram (PFD) of the PCPP system; examples of the boiler and steam turbine sub-\\nprocesses are provided in Fig. 3b) and Fig. 3c), respectively. As shown in Table 1, the configuration and operating \\nconditions of the PCPP are based on current generation PCPP designs used in Japan; the main steam condition was set to \\n25.4 MPa and 607 °C while the reheated steam condition was set to 4.87 MPa and 605 °C. Other configuration and \\noperating conditions (e.g., split fraction of steam extracted for feedwater heating, low pressure turbine inlet pressure) \\nwere basically set to the same value as the NETL report with a few minor modifications. The fuel used in this study was \\n‘Bituminous Illinois No.6’; its higher heating value (HHV) is 27,113 kJ/kg (Zoelle et al., 2015). Gross electrical power \\noutput was calculated from the irreversible adiabatic heat drop in the turbines. Auxiliary electric power consumption \\ncomputable in Aspen Plus® (e.g., induced fan, primary fan, feedwater pump) was calculated within the simulation. \\nAuxiliary power that cannot be computed in Aspen Plus® (e.g., pulverizer, FGD) was calculated using the estimation \\nvalues of the NETL report. In the report, the mass flow rate of the main material streams was reported, and auxiliary \\npower required for the main facilities were estimated. Using these values and the mass flow rate of the main material \\nstreams in this study, we estimated the auxiliary power; we approximated that the required electric power relevant to the \\nfeedwater system (e.g., cooling tower) are proportional to the main steam flow rate and that electric power relevant to \\nfuel use and treatment (e.g., pulverizer, FGD) are proportional to the fuel consumption rate. The main steam flow rate, \\nand necessary adjustment of fuel consumption rate, were set to achieve a net electrical power output of 1,000 MW. At \\nthe rated condition, the main steam flow rate was 2,840 tonne/hour and the fuel consumption rate was 91.22 kg/s. \\n \\nTable 1 Configurations for the PCPP system. \\n \\nUnits \\n \\nGross power output \\nMW \\n1,049 \\nNet power output \\nMW \\n1,000 \\nAuxiliary power \\nMW \\n49 \\nFuel type \\n \\nBituminous Illinois No.6 \\nFuel higher heating value (HHV) \\nkJ/kg \\n27,113 \\nFuel consumption rate \\nkg/s \\n91.22 \\nNet power efficiency \\n% \\n40.4 \\nSteam temperature (main, reheated) \\n°C \\n607, 605 \\nSteam pressure (main, reheated) \\nMPa \\n25.4, 4.87 \\nMain steam flow rate \\nTonne/hour \\n2,840 \\n \\n© The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers\\n \\nFig. 3 Process flow diagram of a) the overall PCPP system, b) the boiler sub-process, and c) the steam turbines. \\n© The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers\\n2.2.2 Modelling of aqueous amine solution in PCC \\nPrior to modelling amine-based PCC, solution property models of MEA and AMP-PZ were established based on the \\n“ENRTL-RK_Rate_Based_MEA_model” and “ENRTL-RK_Rate_Based_PZ/MDEA_model” provided within Aspen \\nPlus®, respectively (Aspen Technology, 2008a; Aspen Technology, 2008b). These built-in models apply the pure \\ncomponent database ‘PURE36’. For the AMP-PZ model, N-Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and its ion species were \\nremoved, and AMP and its ion species were added. The parameters related to following physical properties of AMP were \\nobtained from Aspen Technology (2008c): viscosity, density, surface tension, heat of vaporization, specific heat capacity, \\ndielectric constant, vapor pressure, and Henry’s constant for CO2 in AMP. Table 2 provides chemical reactions in each \\nmodel. \\nThe chemical equilibrium constant (𝐾\\u0bdd) for reaction 𝑗 in Eqs. (1)–(12) in Table 2 was calculated from the change of \\nGibbs free energy (∆𝐺\\u0bdd°), ideal gas constant (𝑅), and temperature (𝑇) as written in Eq. (15). Calculation of ∆𝐺\\u0bdd° was done \\nusing the thermodynamic properties (i.e., standard enthalpy of formation, standard Gibbs free energy of formation, \\nspecific heat capacity) in Aspen Plus® (Aspen Technology, 2008a; Aspen Technology, 2008b). For the chemical reactions \\nof Eqs. (13) and (14), the 𝐾\\u0bdd was calculated using the correlation of Eq. (16) due to the poor accuracy of the vapor liquid \\nequilibrium prediction of the AMP aqueous solution provided by Aspen Plus® (Aspen Technology, 2008c). The constants \\n𝐴–𝐷 in Eq. (16) are provided in Table 3. The chemical equilibrium constant given by Tong et al. (2012) was converted \\nfrom molality to a mole fraction basis. Interaction parameters used in the electrolyte non-random two-liquid (eNRTL) \\nmodel, which calculates the activity coefficient of each chemical species in the system, were given as follows: the values \\nin the PZ/MDEA example file were used for molecule-molecule and molecule-ion pair parameters which include only \\nspecies present in Eqs. (6)–(12), the values reported by Hartono et al. (2020) were used for molecule-molecule and \\nmolecule-ion pair parameters which include only species present in Eqs. (6)–(8) or (13)–(14). In addition to the above \\nalterations, some parameters were determined by fitting to more accurately predict published data of the solution \\nproperties. The list of modified parameters was shown in Isogai and Nakagaki (2022) along with model validation via \\nexperimental data for AMP-PZ aqueous solutions. For the MEA model, the parameters given by Aspen Plus® (Aspen \\nTechnology, 2008a) were used without modification. \\n \\nTable 2 Chemical reactions in the simulation model. \\nModel \\nReaction \\nEq.

The CO2 absorption in the \\nabsorber and the desorption in the stripper were calculated by the Aspen RatesepTM rate-based model. Table 4 provides \\nthe configurations for the absorber and the stripper, along with the operating conditions in the PCC process simulation. \\nThe column diameter was determined to keep the flooding factor below 80%. The structured packing ‘Mellapak 250Y’ \\nwas used for both columns in accordance with recommendations in IEAGHG (2012). The temperature difference at the \\ncold side of the heat exchanger was assumed to be 5 K. The liquid to gas ratio (L/G) was varied as an operating parameter, \\nand the liquid flow rate was varied corresponding to L/G in Table 4. By adjusting the pressure of the stripper according \\nto the change in the liquid flow rate, the temperature at the bottom of the stripper was fixed to 122 °C to mitigate thermal \\ndegradation of the amine solution. The CO2 capture rate was held constant at 90% by adjusting the reboiler duty. \\nRegarding chemical reactions, while reactions in the stripper can be regarded as instantaneous and reach equilibrium due \\nto high temperature (Van Wagener, 2011), some reactions in the absorber must be regarded as a kinetically controlled. \\nFor the MEA model, the kinetically controlled reactions and parameters given in Aspen Plus® (Aspen Technology, 2008a) \\nwere used without any alteration in the absorber calculation. For AMP-PZ model, the kinetically controlled reactions and \\nparameters in Table 5 were included and used in the absorber calculation.

TTPPCC process model development \\nExtensive studies have focused on the only commercialized CO2 \\ncapture technology, post-combustion carbon capture system. For ships \\npowered by fossil fuels, the solvent based TTPPCC methodology is the \\nmost promising process for implementing this technology. Many previ\\xad\\nous milestone works in the field of PCC have pointed out the MEA as an \\nideal solution for carbon capture because of its high CO2 solubility, \\nacceptable reaction kinetics, and fair price. In this manuscript, the MEA \\nwith molality of 7 m (30 % in weight percent) was employed to establish \\nthe base case process model for the TTPPCC system. Furthermore, the \\nunique features and operation limitations of TTPPCC have been identi\\xad\\nfied and shown in Table 3, and the corresponding process modeling \\nconsiderations are listed as well. \\nBased on Table 3, the major considerations to improve the perfor\\xad\\nmance of the TTPPCC process with a maritime process intensification \\nstudy are: the optimized dimension of process units, variant lean solu\\xad\\ntion flows, and intensified absorption/desorption reactions with the \\nleast negative effects. \\n3.1. Physical solubility and Henry’s constant \\nUsing the same approach of molecular interaction calculations as the \\nelectrolyte NRTL, the eNRTL- Redlich-Kwong (RK) property method is \\napplicable for handling aqueous and mixed solvent systems with a wide \\nrange of concentrations [25]. This work adopted eNRTL-RK equation of \\nstate (EOS) to compute the liquid phase thermodynamic properties, \\nwhile the PC-SAFT was utilized for vapor property calculations of the \\nMEA-H2O-CO2 system. The Henry’s constant of the mixture is calculated \\nfrom the binary Henry’s constants of pure solvents (see Eq. 1): \\nln\\n(Hi\\nγ∞\\ni\\n)\\n=\\n∑\\nA\\nwAln\\n(HiA\\nγ∞\\niA\\n)\\n(1)  \\nwhere Hi is Henry’s constant for binary components, γ∞\\ni is the infinite \\ndilution activity coefficient of molecular solute i in the mixed solvent, \\nHiA Henry’s constant of molecular solute i in pure solvent A, γ∞\\niA is the \\ninfinite dilution activity coefficient of molecular solute i in pure solvent \\nA. wA, the weighting factor, is calculated by Eq. 2: \\nFig. 3.

This study adopted the model of Yan and Chen [27] to calculate \\nthe Henry’s constant of CO2 and H2O, and CO2-MEA was extracted from \\nthe work of Liu et al. [28]. The correlation coefficients of N2- H2O and \\nO2-H2O were both from the APV Binary database, while the APV \\nENRTL-RK database was applied for the H2S-H2O binary pair. The \\ndefault values from the Aspen Databank were used for other Henry’s \\nconstants of the binary components [29]. \\n3.2. Carbon capture chemical reaction mechanism \\nThe equilibrium reactions and kinetics-Controlled reactions of the \\nMEA-CO2-H2O mixture have been well investigated, and Table 5 sum\\xad\\nmarizes the two categories of the aqueous phase chemical reactions in \\nthis work. \\nThe equilibrium constants (Ki) for reactions 1–5 in MEA were \\ncalculated from the reference state Gibbs free energies of the partici\\xad\\npating components by Eq. 4 [30]: \\n−RTlnKp = ΔG\\n◦\\np\\n(4)  \\nwhere R is the universal gas constant, T is the system temperature, Kp is \\nthe chemical equilibrium constant of reaction p, and ΔG\\n◦\\np is the reference \\nstate Gibbs energy change for reaction p. The kinetics-controlled re\\xad\\nactions (6–9 in Table 5) are governed by the power law expressions \\nexpressed in the below equation: \\nrq = k\\n◦\\nqTnexp\\n(\\n−Eq\\nRT\\n) ∏\\nN\\ni=1\\n(xiγi)εiq\\n(5)  \\nwhere rq is the reaction rate for reaction q, k\\n◦\\nq is the pre-exponential \\nfactor, Tn is the system temperature with temperature factor n, Eq is \\nthe activation energy, R is the gas constant, xi is the molar fraction of \\ncomponent i, γi is the activity coefficient of component i, and εiq is the \\nstoichiometric of component i in reaction q. \\nThe rate-based mass transfer correlations can be found in the Tab. S- \\n3 of the supplemental document, and the parameters of the other com\\xad\\nponents were collected from the databank of Aspen Plus [29]. \\n3.3. Base case design and validation \\nFig. 4 shows the base case process model of TTPPCC with the major \\ncolumns of absorber and stripper. Two water makeup streams (one for \\nthe pre-cooling module and another for the absorption module) and one \\nMEA replenishment before the leanin flow were incorporated in the PCC \\nprocess, and the operation conditions of the pilot plant were extracted \\nfrom experiment 1 of the Notz study to validate the proposed TTPPCC \\nmodel. The key parameters of TTPPCC validation were identified as \\nLeanin/Richout flow CO2 loading, CO2 emission reduction efficiency \\n(CRE), captured CO2 flow rate, and reboiler or specific reboiler duty. In \\nparticular, the Leanin/Richout flows are expressed per amount of CO2 \\nabsorbed, the CRL is calculated from the CO2 mass difference between \\nthe flue gas and the exhausted gas, and the captured CO2 is the amount \\nof CO2 regenerated after the desorption operation. The energy required \\nby the reboiler was determined by the sum of the latent heat water \\ncondensation (Qcond), the sensible heat for solvent to reach reboiler \\ntemperature (Qsh) and the heat of CO2 desorption (Qdes), then the penalty \\nenergy is calculated by integrating the reboiler duty and the captured \\nCO2 flow rate. The equations of the validation parameters are repre\\xad\\nsented below: \\nαleanin (richout) = [CO2] +\\n[\\nHCO−\\n3\\n]\\n+\\n[\\nCO2−\\n3\\n]\\n+\\n[\\nMEACOO−]\\n[MEA] + [MEAH+] + [MEACOO−]\\n(6)  \\nCRE = yco2,FG∙FFG −yco2,EG∙FEG\\nyco2,FG∙FFG\\n(7)  \\nQreb = Qcond + Qsh + Qdes = mwΔHw + mscp\\n(\\nTbottom −Ttop\\n)\\n−mco2ΔHco2\\n(8)  \\nQspe\\n(MJ\\nkg CO2\\n)\\n=\\nQreb\\nFcap CO2\\n(9) \\nThe experimental data of the pilot plant (Mellapak 250Y packing \\ntype) were extracted from the case 1 of Notz et al.’s study [31]. The \\nmethod from Bravo’s research group [32] was applied to determine \\ncorrections for the mass transfer coefficients and effective interfacial \\narea on the liquid and gas side. The results of the flows of leanin, richout, \\ngasout, and co2out, and the reboiler duty value was obtained by the \\nproposed model. Employing Eq. 6–9, the validation results were calcu\\xad\\nlated and summarized in Table 6. The largest absolute relative deviation \\nof 7.9 % is located in the specific reboiler duty, and others are consistent \\nwith the experimental data as well, leading to the conclusion that the \\nproposed model appears to be in line with experimental results. More\\xad\\nover, the validation process for Sulzer BX, Mellapak plus 252Y, and \\nFlexipac 2Y were completed with acceptable results as well, see \\nTable S-4 in the supplemental document for details. \\n4. TTPPCC process simulation and performance analysis \\nAfter the process synthesis, design, and analysis, the well-known \\nMEA-based PCC operation has been set as the base case of the TTPPCC \\nmodel with good validation results. As per the framework of the sus\\xad\\ntainable process synthesis-intensification [33], the innovation design \\nshould be the next focus to find a more eco-friendly solution for our \\ndefined maritime system. Referenced from the above-mentioned con\\xad\\nsiderations in Table 3 of TTPPCC modelling, the alternative design for \\nintensified unit operations would involve sustainable solvent selection, \\noptimal column dimension determination, variance of L/G ratio, and \\nminimal energy penalty for the TTPPCC system. \\nTable 5 \\nReactions in the kinetic model for MEA-CO2-H2O system.  \\nReaction No. \\nReaction Type \\nStoichiometry \\n1 \\nEquilibrium \\nMEAH+ + H2O ↔H3O+ + MEA  \\n2 \\nEquilibrium \\n2H2O ↔H3O+ + OH−\\n3 \\nEquilibrium \\nHCO−\\n3 + H2O ↔H3O+ + CO2−\\n3  \\n4 \\nEquilibrium \\nH2S + H2O ↔HS−+ H3O+\\n5 \\nEquilibrium \\nH2O + HS−↔S2−+ H3O+\\n6 \\nKinetic \\nCO2 + OH−→HCO−\\n3  \\n7 \\nKinetic \\nHCO−\\n3 →CO2 + OH−\\n8 \\nKinetic \\nMEA + H2O + CO2 →MEACOO−+ H3O+\\n9 \\nKinetic \\nMEACOO−+ H3O+→MEA + H2O + CO2   \\nC.

Analysis of solvent selection \\nDue to the unique features of maritime PCC (see Table 3), the criteria \\nof solvent selection are as follows: fast kinetics, minimal energy penalty, \\nless prone to degradation, less corrosive, and neglectable toxicity. In \\naddition, to reduce the sensible heat loss and the dimension of maritime \\nPCC system, the solvent should have high cyclic capacity, which refers to \\nthe difference between the CO2concentration in the rich and lean solu\\xad\\ntion. The molar cyclic CO2 absorption capacity (the cyclic capacity in \\nthis work) of aqueous single and blended amines is defined as: \\nΔα = αrichout −αleanin\\n(13)  \\nwhere αleanin represents the CO2loading of the initial amine solution, and \\nαrichout is the CO2loading of the amine solution after absorption. \\nOne single aqueous amine and one blended amine were selected to \\nfind an optimal solution of the proposed TTPPCC system. Diisopropa\\xad\\nnolamine (DIPA) was chosen as the single amine for the TTPPCC system \\nsince the aqueous DIPA solution requires less energy to regenerate, \\nremoves CO2 without degradation of the solution, and also is less cor\\xad\\nrosive and has greater selectivity of H2S toward CO2 [37]. Moreover, the \\nmethyldiethanolamine (MDEA) is another alkanol-amine which has less \\nregeneration cost, lower volatility, greater thermal stability and higher \\nCO2 cyclic capacity. However, both DIPA and MDEA have one common \\nweakness for maritime carbon capture, a lower second order CO2 ab\\xad\\nsorption rate constant (K2) than MEA [38], leading to their inferior \\nabsorption reaction rate. Many studies have pointed out the blended \\namine with the promotor PZ is a superior solution to resist to degrada\\xad\\ntion with higher kinetic rates. Therefore, this study proposed an inten\\xad\\nsified maritime carbon capture process using a MDEA-PZ-CO2-H2O \\nsystem. \\nThis study completed 40 process simulations in total: 16 groups for \\nMEA, 16 groups for DIPA, and 8 groups for MDEA-PZ (since the flooding \\npercentage of absorber and stripper exceeded 80 % when L/G ratio was \\nset as 3 and 4). The input values of selected variables for the TTPPCC \\nsystem, including the composition of the selected solvent in leanin flow, \\nthe calculated richout loading range, and the diameter, stages and height \\nof absorber and stripper, are listed in Table 9.

TTPPCC system performance analysis \\nThe black dashed line and orange dashed line in Fig. 6 represent IMO \\n2030 and 2050 carbon reduction goals, respectively. In general, the \\nMEA outperforms DIPA in every defined scenario. There is a clear trend \\nthat the carbon reduction level is increasing when the L/G ratio goes up \\nfor the two single-amine solvents. Furthermore, the sustainable- \\npreferred packing type is as follows: Sulzer BX > Mellapak 250 Y >\\nMellapak plus 252Y > Flexipac 2Y. \\nA conclusion can be made that only the maximum L/G ratio of DIPA \\ncases can satisfy the IMO 2050 carbon reduction strategy, and when the \\nL/G ratio equals 1, DIPA solvent is not even eligible for the 2030 IMO \\ncarbon reduction plan. When L/G ratio exceeds 2, the MEA solvent can \\nmeet the IMO long-term strategy well, but not when the L/G ratio falls \\nbelow 2. \\nIn Fig. 7, the DIPA solution saves more energy than MEA, and when \\nthe L/G ratio goes up, more energy will be saved by adopting DIPA over \\nMEA. From the perspective of energy saving, the preferred packing type \\nwould correspond to the highest carbon capture efficiency in most cases. \\nThe best energy-saving performance is 3.22 MJ/Kg CO2 which is ob\\xad\\ntained by DIPA solvent with BX under L/G = 1, while the worst case is \\nthe MEA solvent with MEA with Flexipac 2Y under L/G = 4, which yields \\na value of 10.7 MJ/Kg CO2. \\nTo summarize, there will be a tradeoff between carbon capture \\nperformance and specific reboiler duty for the two single amines. \\nAlthough DIPA is applicable for short-term IMO strategy with less en\\xad\\nergy consumption when the L/G ratio exceeds 2, MEA is recommended \\nfor most cases since its carbon capture performance is much better than \\nthat of DIPA. \\nNext, the TTPPCC process was conducted by introducing the blended \\nMDEA and PZ solvent. The carbon capture performance and the specific \\nreboiler duty of the three solvents are shown in Fig. 8. \\nOverall, the CO2 capture efficiency of MDEA-PZ tops the other op\\xad\\ntions, and its regeneration energy is between MEA and DIPA (see Fig. 8 \\n(a)). When the liquid flow is equal to gas flow (L/G = 1 cases), the \\nMDEA-PZ is still capable of meeting the 2050 IMO carbon strategy with \\nthe only exception being the Flexipac 2Y case. As for L/G = 2, all the \\nblend amine cases generated great carbon capture results, as more than \\n95 % CO2 from the ship engine flue gas was reduced by installing the \\nTTPPCC system. DIPA is the best option for specific reboiler duty, and \\nthe blend-amine option presented performance similar to DIPA for the \\nL/G = 1 cases; when the leanin flow rate is twice of that of the flue gas, \\nthe MDEA-PZ option can save more than 10 % energy for every mole \\ncaptured CO2 compared to the benchmark solvent MEA. \\nTable 8 \\nThe designed diameter and cross-sectional area for variant L/G ratio and multiple packing types.  \\nLiquid \\ngas \\nratio \\nFlow \\npara., \\nFLV  \\nFlooding \\ncorr. \\nfactor, k4 \\nPacked \\ntype \\nPacking \\nfactor \\n(m-1), Fp \\nGas mass \\nflowrate per \\nunit column \\nC/S area \\n(kg/m2s), \\nV∗\\nw  \\nTrial C/ \\nS area \\n(m2), a \\nTrial \\ndiameter \\n(m), d \\nFlooding \\nfactor, Kfl  \\nTrial \\nflooding \\npercentage \\n(%) \\nDesign \\ndiameter \\n(m) \\nColumn \\nC/S area \\n(m2) \\nColumn \\nflooding \\npercentage \\n(%) \\n1.0 \\n0.032 \\n0.90 \\nMellapak \\nplus 252Y \\n39.0 \\n2.701 \\n24.927 \\n5.635 \\n5.4 \\n0.408 \\n6.0 \\n19.63 \\n0.518 \\nFlexipac \\n2Y \\n49.0 \\n2.409 \\n27.941 \\n5.966 \\n6.0 \\n23.76 \\n0.480 \\nMellapak \\n250 Y \\n66.0 \\n2.076 \\n32.427 \\n6.427 \\n6.5 \\n28.27 \\n0.468 \\nSulzer BX \\n90.0 \\n1.778 \\n37.867 \\n6.945 \\n7.0 \\n33.18 \\n0.466 \\n2.0 \\n0.064 \\n0.80 \\nMellapak \\nplus 252Y \\n39.0 \\n2.546 \\n26.439 \\n5.803 \\n4.0 \\n0.447 \\n6.0 \\n19.63 \\n0.602 \\nFlexipac \\n2Y \\n49.0 \\n2.272 \\n29.635 \\n6.144 \\n6.5 \\n23.76 \\n0.558 \\nMellapak \\n250 Y \\n66.0 \\n1.957 \\n34.394 \\n6.619 \\n7.0 \\n28.27 \\n0.544 \\nSulzer BX \\n90.0 \\n1.676 \\n40.164 \\n7.153 \\n7.5 \\n33.18 \\n0.541 \\n3.0 \\n0.096 \\n0.78 \\nMellapak \\nplus 252Y \\n39.0 \\n2.514 \\n26.776 \\n5.840 \\n3.4 \\n0.479 \\n6.0 \\n23.76 \\n0.540 \\nFlexipac \\n2Y \\n49.0 \\n2.243 \\n30.013 \\n6.183 \\n6.5 \\n23.76 \\n0.605 \\nMellapak \\n250 Y \\n66.0 \\n1.933 \\n34.832 \\n6.661 \\n7.0 \\n28.27 \\n0.590 \\nSulzer BX \\n90.0 \\n1.655 \\n40.675 \\n7.198 \\n7.5 \\n33.18 \\n0.587 \\n4.0 \\n0.129 \\n0.70 \\nMellapak \\nplus 252Y \\n39.0 \\n2.382 \\n28.265 \\n6.000 \\n3.1 \\n0.475 \\n6.5 \\n23.76 \\n0.565 \\nFlexipac \\n2Y \\n49.0 \\n2.125 \\n31.682 \\n6.353 \\n6.5 \\n28.27 \\n0.533 \\nMellapak \\n250 Y \\n66.0 \\n1.831 \\n36.769 \\n6.844 \\n7.0 \\n28.27 \\n0.618 \\nSulzer BX \\n90.0 \\n1.568 \\n42.937 \\n7.396 \\n7.5 \\n33.18 \\n0.615  \\nTable 9 \\nTTPPCC process simulation input variables.   \\nSolvent \\nInput variables \\nMEA \\nDIPA \\nMDEA-PZ \\nComposition (on molality scale) \\n7 m \\n6 m \\n5 m + 5 m \\nLeanin loading (mole CO2/mole \\namine) \\n0.199 \\n0.029 \\n0.127 \\nRichout loading range (mole \\nCO2/mole amine) \\n[0.309, \\n0.489] \\n[0.195, \\n0.318] \\n[0.406, \\n0.489] \\nDiameter of absorber (stripper) \\nBX: 7.5(4.5) \\nBX: 7.5(4.5) \\nBX: 7.5(6.5)  \\nM 250: 7 \\n(4.5) \\nM 250: 7 \\n(4.5) \\nM 250: 7 \\n(6.5)  \\nMp 252: 6.5 \\n(4.5) \\nMp 252: 6.5 \\n(4.5) \\nMp 252: 6.5 \\n(6.5)  \\n2Y: 6.5(4.5) \\n2Y: 6.5(4.5) \\n2Y: 6.5(6.5) \\nStages of absorber (stripper) \\n20 (8) \\n20 (8) \\n20 (8) \\nHeight of absorber (stripper) \\n10 (6) \\n10 (6) \\n10 (6)  \\nC.

The ideal \\nsolvent for the TTPPCC system can be identified as low specific reboiler \\nduty and high carbon reduction efficiency, as shown in the right corner \\nof Fig. 10. Additionally, one can easily conclude that the cases of MDEA- \\nPZ solvent with L/G equals to one have the best overall emission control- \\nenergy saving performance, and the MEA (L/G = 1) group and DIPA (L/ \\nG = 2) group share similar TTPPCC performance. \\n5. Conclusion \\nThis study successfully established the process model of a 2-stroke \\nship engine system consisting of three W¨artsil¨a 12V50DF and one \\n6L50DF and presented a good validation result. Following the stages of \\nsustainable process intensification, a rate-based aqueous MEA process \\nmodel was developed and validated, then scaled up and modified to \\ncapture CO2 from the flue gas. Also, a blended amine process model was \\nestablished to simulate the onboard PCC system for the first time. The \\ninnovative design covered the absorber /stripper design with variation \\nof solvents, packed type, and liquid gas ratio. A thorough sustainability \\nevaluation of emission reduction efficiency, energy penalty, and carbon \\ncyclic capacity was conducted among three aqueous amine options: \\nMEA, DIPA, and MDEA-PZ. Compared to the benchmark aqueous amine \\nMEA, the MDEA-PZ option could capture more than 57 % CO2 while \\naround 25 % specific reboiler duty can be saved. The generated results \\nconfirmed that the Sulzer BX was preferred among the selected four \\npacking types from the perspective of carbon capture efficiency and \\nenergy requirement for solvent regeneration, and the cyclic capacity has \\nan inverse relationship with the lean solution flow rate. \\nNewly blended aqueous amines, particularly ternary mixtures, might \\nbe the next focus on the solvent selection of the chemical absorption- \\nbased maritime capture system, despite the binary blended amines dis\\xad\\nplaying satisfactory PCC performance in this study. The TTPPCC system \\nneeds more studies on the kinetics modeling, the second-order absorp\\xad\\ntion rate constant, and activation energy to meet its requirement of fast \\nreaction rate and low energy consumption. Moreover, process design for \\nintensified unit operations involving rotating packed bed and printed \\nFig. 9. Cyclic capacity of MEA, DIPA and MDEA-PZ.  \\nFig. 10.

        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: The huge energy penalty of CO2 desorption is the greatest\\nchallenge impeding the commercial application of amine-based CO2 capture.\\nTo deal with this problem, a series of metal oxide and oxyhydroxide catalysts\\nwere synthesized in this study to kinetically facilitate the CO2 desorption\\nfrom 5.0 M monoethanolamine (MEA). The effects of selected catalysts on\\nCO2 absorption kinetics, CO2 absorption capacity, CO2 reaction enthalpy,\\nand desorption duty reduction of 2.0 M MEA were investigated by a true\\nheat flow reaction calorimeter to access the practical feasibility of the\\ncatalytic CO2 desorption. The kinetic study of catalytic CO2 desorption was\\nalso carried out. CO2 desorption chemistry, catalyst characterization, and\\nstructure−function relationships were investigated to reveal the underlying\\nmechanisms. Results show that addition of the catalyst had slight effects on\\nthe CO2 absorption kinetics and CO2 reaction enthalpy of MEA. In contrast,\\nthe CO2 desorption efficiency greatly increased from 28% in reference MEA to 52% in ZrO(OH)2-aided MEA. Compared to the\\nbenchmark catalyst HZSM-5, ZrO(OH)2 exhibited a 13% improvement in CO2 desorption efficiency. More importantly, compared\\nto the reference MEA, the CO2 desorption duties of ZrO(OH)2 and FeOOH-aided MEA significantly reduced by 45 and 47%\\nrespectively, which are better than those of most other reported catalysts. The large surface area, pore volume, pore diameter, and\\namount of surface hydroxyl groups of ZrO(OH)2 and FeOOH afforded the catalytic performance by promoting the adsorption of\\nalkaline speciation (e.g., MEA and HCO3\\n−) onto the particle surface.'"

The excess molar volume (Vm\\nE ), viscosity deviation (Δη) and surface tension deviation (Δγ) of the solution\\nwere calculated and ﬁtted by Redlich-Kister (R-K) equation to evaluate the factor and standard deviations be-\\ntween the experimental and calculated quantities.

In term of the ex-\\ncess molar volume, the intermolecular bonds were closely formed when the molar ratio of TEG to DAP was at 1: 1.\\nThis system showed strong CO2 capture capability, in which about 0.34 g CO2 was absorbed by per gram of DAP\\nand TEG system.

        "Abstract": "'A B S T R A C T   \\nAqueous amines-based absorption is the most mature and scalable technology for post-combustion carbon \\ncapture, but subject to high energy and capital investment costs. Water-lean solvents, with associated advanced \\nprocess configurations, show promise of significantly reducing both energy and capital costs via lower solvent \\nrecirculation and lower water condensation and vaporization. Even though advanced process configurations \\nhave been intensively studied for aqueous amines, few discussions can be found in the open literature for water- \\nlean solvents. In order to fill the gap, the present study focuses on the process designs towards lower carbon \\ncapture cost enabled by water-lean solvents. N-(2-ethoxyethyl)-3-morpholinopropan-1-amine (EEMPA), a single- \\ncomponent water-lean solvent, was selected as an archetypical water-lean solvent.

The results show a two-stage flash \\nconfiguration, has a carbon capture cost of $47.1/tonne CO2 (in 2011 US dollars), about 19% lower than the \\nindustrial benchmark, Cansolv.

Particularly, Section \\n3.1 presents sensitivity studies to evaluate the impacts and the optimal \\nvalues of key process design variables (i.e. lean loading and regeneration \\npressure).

Section 3.3 compares the key performance and eco\\xad\\nnomic projections of seven process configuration at the baseline, opti\\xad\\nmistic and conservative schemes. \\n3.1. Impacts of lean loading and regeneration pressure \\nThe selection of CO2 loading in the lean solvent and the pressure for \\nsolvent regeneration may significantly impact the performance and \\neconomic projections of a water-lean solvent system. Sensitivity studies \\nwere performed to determine the optimal lean loading and regeneration \\npressure for EEMPA system with the lowest CO2 capture cost.

Conse\\xad\\nquently, Fig. 8(c) indicates that the total equivalent work of carbon \\ncapture decreases monotonically with the increasing lean loading. \\nHowever, for a fixed CO2 capture rate, 90% in this work, the solvent \\ncirculation rate, as shown in Fig. 8(d) increases with the increasing lean \\nloading, as the solvent working capacity (defined as the difference be\\xad\\ntween rich and lean loadings) decreases. Consequently, the reboiler \\nduty, especially the sensible heat, increases, as shown in Fig. 8(a), while \\nlarger columns and solvent circulation pumps are required during the \\ndesign. The impact of lean loading on the capital cost is complicated, as \\nshown in Fig. 8(e). In a carbon capture unit, the three major capital \\nitems are absorber, stripper and cross exchanger. A higher lean loading \\nwill lead to larger column sizes, but a lower design temperature for \\nstripper and exchanger, which have opposite impacts on the capital cost. \\nFor the cross exchanger, with a fixed approach temperature, its size is \\ndominated by the heat duty ( ˙mCpΔT), when phase change is negligible. \\nThe flow rate ( ˙m) increases with lean loading, while the temperature \\nchange (ΔT) decreases because of the lower regeneration temperature. \\nTaking all of the above impacts into consideration, Fig. 8(f) indicates \\nthat the carbon capture cost will first decrease and then increase with \\nthe increasing lean loading. \\nFig. 9 shows the impact of regeneration pressure on the primary \\nperformance parameters for a SS configuration. Here, an optimal \\nregeneration pressure of 2.32 bar was identified for the SS configuration, \\nwith a carbon capture cost of $49.1/tonne CO2. With an increasing \\nregeneration pressure, the regeneration temperature increases as shown \\nin Fig. 9(a) leading to a higher equivalent work, as shown in Fig. 9(b), \\nwhile the electricity consumption and capital cost of CO2 compressor \\ncan be significantly reduced. Consequently, the carbon capture cost \\npredictions in Fig. 9 decrease at the beginning and then increases as the \\nregeneration pressure increases from 1.81 bar to 3.33 bar. The impacts \\nof lean loading and regeneration pressure on the TSF configuration are \\nsimilar to the SS configuration and illustrated in Fig. 10, where LL and \\nLP represent the lean loading in mol CO2/ mol solvent, and the pressure \\nof LP flash drum, respectively.

Impacts of uncertainties in property and cost models \\nNext, a high-level perturbation scheme analysis is conducted to \\nprovide optimistic and conservative boundaries for the key performance \\nand economic measures of the EEMPA system and to quantify the \\npotential impacts of uncertainties in property and cost models (approach \\ndetailed in Sections 2.2 and 2.5). The results for the perturbation \\nanalysis for the SS configuration are shown in Fig. 11. Here, a +/ −10% \\nperturbation in key property measures and a +30%/ −20% \\nperturbation in capital cost projection show a ±5% deviation in the \\nestimation of equivalent work consumption, a +8%/ −7% deviation in \\nthe estimation of reboiler duty, a less than 3% deviation in the estima\\xad\\ntion of solvent circulation rate and regeneration temperature, and \\na +16%/ −10% deviation in the estimation of carbon capture cost. \\nNote that, for the SS configuration, uncertainties in the capital cost \\nestimation contributes to about 80% (about $5.2/tonne CO2) of the total \\ndeviations in the estimation of carbon capture cost, while the remaining \\n20% comes from the uncertainties in property models (about $1.3/tonne \\nCO2). As discussed in Section 3.1, the largest difference in carbon \\ncapture cost for SS is about $2.0/tonne CO2 between different operation \\nconditions, which is at the same order of magnitude of the potential \\ndeviation in cost estimation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the \\ncurrent model does provide reasonable trends when analyzing the \\nimpact of lean loading and regeneration pressure, while the optimal \\nvalues may be subject to small changes as the property model is refined \\nwith on-going experimental data collection. \\n3.3.

Table 4 summarizes key \\nperformance and economic measures at the baseline scheme for EEMPA \\nand the comparison with NETL’s baseline cases with MEA (NETL, 2010) \\nand Cansolv (NETL, 2015). Additionally, Fig. 12 provides a detailed cost \\nbreakdown. Here, the solid bars present the cost at the baseline scheme; \\nthe dashed lines and error bars represent the deviations in cost estima\\xad\\ntions at the optimistic and conservative schemes. \\nAs shown in Table 4, all EEMPA cases have much lower energy \\npenalty than MEA and Cansolv, due to the “water-lean” attribute of \\nEEMPA. The pumping work of EEMPA is higher because of the slightly \\nhigher viscosity. The EEMPA cases also required additional energy and \\ncapital investment for flue gas chilling via NH3 refrigeration cycle for \\nbetter performance, which is not required by MEA and Cansolv. \\nHowever, the magnitude of refrigeration was only 2% of the total energy \\nconsumption, and 3–4% of total capital investment, respectively. The \\nenergy penalties rank as AFS > SS > IHC > TSF > LPH > LVC > AHI in \\nterms of total equivalent work. It is noted that the relative difference in \\ntotal equivalent work is about 15% between the best and worst EEMPA \\ncases. As discussed in Section 3.2, a +/ −10% deviation in equivalent \\nwork estimation is expected between the optimistic, baseline and \\nconservative schemes. Therefore, the current model is sufficient to \\npredict trends and provide a primary comparison. In addition, because \\nof the low water content of EEMPA, compared to aqueous amine \\nsystems, configurations such as LVC and AFS were not predicted to \\nprovide significant reductions in energy penalty and carbon capture \\ncost. It is expected since LVC and AFS are originally proposed for \\naqueous amine solvents because of their abilities to offer better water \\nmanagement (Scherffius et al., 2013; Lin and Rochelle, 2014). Among all \\nconfigurations, AHI was shown to be the most energy efficient option for \\nEEMPA because it is highly heat integrated (as shown in Fig. 4(g)), \\nproviding the lowest reboiler heat rate, lowest equivalent work, and \\nhighest net plant efficiency. With the AHI configuration, EEMPA was \\nestimated to provide a reboiler heat rate of 2.3 GJt/tonne CO2, 35% \\nlower than MEA and 18% lower than Cansolv. The corresponding \\nequivalent work for EEMPA in the AHI configuration was 28.1 kJe/mol \\nCO2, which is 47% lower than MEA and 29% lower than Cansolv. The \\nreduction in equivalent work is much larger than that in reboiler heat \\nrate, because EEMPA can be regenerated at lower temperature and \\nhigher pressure. However, AHI is a more complicated process arrange\\xad\\nment compared to the other configurations, which may reduce its \\noverall attractiveness. Note that, our previous study (Zheng et al., 2020) \\nindicates that with a lower lean loading (0.045 mol CO2/mol solvent), a \\nreboiler heat rate of 2.0 GJ/tonne CO2 can be achieved with EEMPA and \\nthe AHI configuration, at the expense of higher reboiler temperature and \\ntherefore higher equivalent work and carbon capture cost ($50.6/tonne \\nCO2). This new design provides a lower equivalent work and carbon \\ncapture cost at the expense of a slightly elevated reboiler duty. \\nFig. 12 shows a breakdown of the individual predicted carbon \\ncapture costs for each of the process configurations assessed in the \\ncurrent study. The data in Fig. 12 show carbon capture costs for the \\nEEMPA process arrangements ranging from $47.1/tonne CO2 to $49.8/ \\ntonne CO2. The optimistic and conservative ranges for these costs are \\nalso shown in Fig. 12. These ranges were based on the results from the \\nperturbation analysis and were approximately +8/−5 $/tonne CO2 \\nhigher and lower, respectively, for each process configuration. Note that \\nin all cases shown in Fig. 12 the conservative end of the EEMPA esti\\xad\\nmates were lower than the Cansolv reference. The dominant contribu\\xad\\ntors to the lower carbon capture costs for EEMPA were the lower energy \\npenalty and the ability to use less expensive plastic packing in the \\nabsorber (Leclaire and Heldebrant, 2018; Jiang et al., 2019a, b). Similar \\nto aqueous amine systems, the fuel and capital costs were still the two \\nlargest contributors to the total carbon capture cost for EEMPA. \\nCompared with the values in Fig. 1, the capital cost was a larger fraction \\nof the total carbon capture cost for EEMPA compared to aqueous amines \\nbecause of the significant improvement in energy efficiency. Addition\\xad\\nally, the cross heat exchanger in the EEMPA system is larger than that of \\naqueous amine system due the correspondingly lower thermal conduc\\xad\\ntivity. Note that the fixed and variable costs for EEMPA in Fig. 12 were \\nnearly the same, and similar to that of Cansolv. This similarity is due to \\nthe fact that only small changes in plant configurations were made, \\nwhich does not significantly impact the number of operators and the \\namount of solvent loss. \\nAmong all process configurations shown in Fig. 12, TSF has the \\nlowest predicted carbon capture cost due to savings in capital costs by \\nreplacing the stripper with two flash drums, even though its corre\\xad\\nsponding regeneration heat rate is slightly higher. AFS has the highest \\ncarbon capture cost because it has negligible saving in energy penalty \\nbut comes with a considerable increase in plant complexity. In addition \\nto TSF, AHI can also bring a significant reduction in carbon capture cost \\ncomparing with SS, about $0.8/tonne CO2, due to energy savings, but \\npotentially higher capital costs. Despite these advantages and disad\\xad\\nvantages, the difference in carbon capture costs between SS, LVC, IHC, \\nand LPH is less than $0.4/tonne CO2, which is not significant enough to \\nnecessarily differentiate one process over another at the present level of \\nanalysis. \\n4. Conclusions \\nIn summary, a property package was developed and validated for the \\nEEMPA-H2O−CO2 system. Plant-wide process models were developed in \\nAspen Plus for 90% post-combustion carbon capture from a supercritical \\ncoal-fired plant with EEMPA in seven different process configurations. \\nOptimal lean loading and regeneration pressure were identified from \\nsensitivity studies. A primary techno-economic comparison, subject to a \\n+16%/ −10% deviation in the estimation of carbon capture costs, was \\nconducted. The results showed that even with the simplest process \\nFig. 12. Breakdown in carbon capture costs of various process configurations with EEMPA.  \\nY.

Energy penalties were predicted to further reduce with \\nadvanced solvent regeneration configurations. For EEMPA, AHI pro\\xad\\nvides the lowest energy penalty of 28.1 kJe/mol CO2, about 8% lower \\nthan the standard SS configuration. However, configurations such as \\nLVC and AFS, with significant efficiency gains proven for aqueous \\namines, did not show significant predicted reductions in energy and cost \\nfor EEMPA. Based on the current analysis, TSF is the deemed the best \\nconfiguration for EEMPA, offering the lowest carbon capture cost of \\n$47.1/tonne CO2 due to its lowest capital cost investment. For EEMPA, \\nSS and TSF are also predicted to provide carbon capture costs 16% and \\n19% lower than Cansolv, respectively. Further reduction in carbon \\ncapture cost with water-lean solvents could be possible with further \\nsolvent development and process optimization. \\nCRediT authorship contribution statement \\nYuan Jiang: Methodology, Writing - original draft.

The single-crystal\\nX-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that all the MOFs feature a\\nsimilar type of three-dimensional structure having a binuclear\\n[Cd2(COO)4(N)4] secondary building block unit. Moreover,\\nMOFs 1 and 2 contain one-dimensional channels along the b-\\naxis, whereas MOF 3 possesses a 1D channel along the a-axis. In these MOFs, the pores are decorated with multifunctional groups,\\ni.e., halogen and amine. The gas adsorption analysis of these MOFs demonstrate that they display high uptake of CO2 (up to 5.34\\nmmol/g) over N2 and CH4. The isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) value for CO2 at zero loadings is in the range of 18−26 kJ mol−1.\\nIn order to understand the mechanism behind the better adsorption of CO2 by our MOFs, we have also performed configurational\\nbias Monte Carlo simulation studies, which confirm that the interaction between our MOFs and CO2 is stronger compared to those\\nwith N2 and CH4. Various noncovalent interactions, e.g., halogen (X)···O, Cd···O, and O···O, between CO2 and the halogen atom,\\nthe Cd(II) metal center, and the carboxylate group from the MOFs are observed, respectively, which may be a reason for the higher\\ncarbon dioxide adsorption. Ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) calculations of MOF 1 demonstrate that the obtained selectivity\\nvalues for CO2/CH4 (50:50) and CO2/N2 (15:85) are ca. 28 and 193 at 273 K, respectively. However, upon increasing the\\ntemperature to 298 K, the selectivity value (S = 34) decreases significantly for the CO2/N2 mixture. We have also calculated the\\nbreakthrough analysis curves for all the MOFs using mixtures of CO2/CH4 (50:50) and CO2/N2 (50:50 and 15:85) at different\\nentering gas velocities and observed larger retention times for CO2 in comparison with other gases, which also signifies the stronger\\ninteraction between our MOFs and CO2. Moreover, due to the presence of Lewis acidic metal centers, these MOFs act as\\nheterogeneous catalysts for the CO2 fixation reactions with different epoxides in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide\\n(TBAB), for conversion into industrially valuable cyclic carbonates. These MOFs exhibit a high conversion (96−99%) of\\nepichlorohydrin (ECH) to the corresponding cyclic carbonate 4-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-2-one after 12 h of reaction time at 1\\nbar of CO2 pressure, at 65 °C. The MOFs can be reused up to four cycles without compromising their structural integrity as well as\\nwithout losing their activity significantly.\\nKEYWORDS: metal−organic frameworks, carbon dioxide, adsorption, selectivity, heterogeneous catalysis, Monte Carlo simulation'"

        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: Ionic liquids (ILs) containing aprotic N-hetero-\\ncyclic anions (AHAs) are attractive CO2 capture solvents.\\nHowever, CO2 uptake has only been measured in a limited subset\\nof AHAs (27 tetraalkylphosphonium AHA ILs with 14 unique\\nAHAs). To evaluate the broader range of possible AHA ILs with\\ntetraalkylphosphonium cations, we develop a CO2 uptake model\\nwhich is a function of temperature, pressure, and anion−CO2\\nreaction enthalpy calculated using electronic structure methods\\n(DFT). The resulting model accurately describes CO2 uptake\\nwithin ±0.046 mol CO2 per mole of AHA ILs on average. We use\\nthis model to predict the CO2 uptake for ILs of an additional 267\\nAHAs, whose uptakes have not been measured, for post-\\ncombustion carbon capture. Several identified candidates demon-\\nstrate similar or greater CO2 cyclic capacity than the best performing aqueous amines. Additionally, we show that the anion−CO2\\nreaction enthalpy, and hence the anion’s basicity, can be correlated with a novel COSMO-RS descriptor\\x01the σ-potential slope of\\nthe uncomplexed anion. This requires only a single DFT calculation, roughly halving the computational requirement to construct the\\nuptake model.

        "Abstract": "'Abstract: While nonaqueous organic-amine absorbents have great potential in reducing energy\\nconsumption of CO2 capture, their absorption/desorption behaviors are still poorly understood when\\nhigh-concentration polyamines are used. On the other hand, large scale CO2 capture demands the use\\nof high-concentration polyamines absorbents. Therefore, we investigated the absorption and\\nmicrowave regeneration behavior of high-concentration triethylenetetramine (TETA) in three typical\\norganic solvents, including polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200), diethylene glycol (DEG), and ethylene\\nglycol (EG). The results showed that high-concentration TETA nonaqueous absorbents demonstrate\\nadvantages in absorption rate and regeneration energy consumption. The average absorption rate of\\n2.0 and 5.0 mol/L TETA/EG was 2.84 and 4.70 times that of 0.6 mol/L, respectively. The energy\\nconsumption of TETA/EG and TETA/DEG decreased by 29.4 and 25.6% as the concentration increased\\nfrom 0.6 to 5.0 mol/L. In addition, the high-concentration TETA/PEG200 absorbent demonstrated\\nobservable tolerance for water vapor, which usually exists in flue gas. Results also showed that\\nmicrowave regeneration was superior to conventional conduction heating especially when\\nhigh-concentration TETA/PEG200 absorbent were used. The energy consumption of microwave\\nregeneration of the absorbent with a concentration of 0.6, 2.0, and 5.0 mol/L was reduced by 65.9,\\n81.2, and 86.0%, respectively when compared with conduction heating. © 2022 Society of Chemical\\nIndustry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\nCorrespondence to: Yi He, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058,\\nPR China.\\nE-mail: yihezj@zju.edu.cn\\nReceived November 24, 2021; revised March 11, 2022; accepted March 30, 2022\\nPublished online at Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com).

However, extensive energy input and severe\\nequipment corrosion constitute their major and inherent drawbacks due to the involvement of\\nvast amounts of water as the diluent. Water-lean absorbents are proposed to deliver potential\\nbeneﬁts, such as higher capacity and enhanced energy eﬃciency, by abandoning the aqueous\\nsolvent or replacing it with organic counterparts. Great eﬀorts have been devoted to the\\ndevelopment of CO2 capture protocols under nonaqueous circumstance, but their industrial\\ndeployment is still challenged by the exponentially increasing viscosity during operation. In this\\nwork, a series of alkoxy-functionalized methylamines have been devised as single-component\\npostcombustion CO2 absorbents under water-lean condition. These nonaqueous amines are\\ncapable of reversibly capturing CO2 with low viscosities (48−114 cP at 25 °C and 27−63 cP at\\n40 °C) at their maximal gravimetric capacities (15−21 wt % at 25 °C and 14−21 wt % at 40\\n°C). Comprehensive mechanistic studies by means of in situ Fourier transform infrared\\nspectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and control experiments revealed that the\\nstabilization of sequestered CO2 via intramolecular hydrogen bonding between in situ formed carbamic acid and the ﬂexible alkoxy\\nside chain of the designed amines would play the key role in enhancing both the capacity and ﬂowability. Meanwhile, thermal\\ndesorption of the captured CO2 could easily be carried out at a feasible temperature (75 °C) under ambient pressure, and the CO2-\\nsaturated absorbents have remained intact at 80 °C for 2 days within a closed system. Furthermore, these novel amines would exhibit\\nconsiderable physisorption by operating at high-pressure conditions (20 and 30 bar), thanks to the inherent CO2-philicity of the\\nalkoxy functionality. Hence, the integration of enhanced capacity, reduced operating viscosity, and mild regeneration makes such\\nalkoxy-functionalized methylamine-type absorbent a compelling candidate for practical application.'"

        "Abstract": "'a b s t r a c t \\nAerosol emissions from the CO2 -capture process have a signiﬁcant impact on both solvent depletion and en- \\nvironmental contamination. This work comprehensively investigated the emissions of AMP (2-amino-2-methyl- \\n1propanol)/PZ (piperazine) from a bench-scale platform and a CO2 -capture pilot plant. The concentration of \\nnuclei in ﬂue gas is a key factor aﬀecting aerosol emissions, and a high nuclei concentration leads to more se- \\nrious aerosol emission problems. The amine emissions after the absorber in the three diﬀerent scenarios (no \\nadded nuclei, nuclei added, and pilot plant) were 273, 1051, and 1347 mg/Nm3 , respectively. Increasing the \\nlean-solvent temperature promoted aerosol emissions, and increasing the liquid/gas ratio and CO2 loading in \\nthe lean solvent suppressed aerosol emissions. In the pilot plant, the eﬀects of four mitigation measures were \\nevaluated, and it was found that dry bed and acid washing had better mitigation eﬀects than did conventional \\nwater washing; amine emissions could be reduced to as low as 21 mg/Nm3 PZ and 25 mg/Nm3 AMP.

        "Title": "'Oxidative stability of structurally varied amines for post-combustion \\nCO2 capture \\n'",
        "Abstract": "'A B S T R A C T   \\nAmine degradation is one of the key issues that hampers the implementation of amine-based post combustion \\ncarbon capture technology. In this work, the oxidative degradation of fourteen structurally varied amines were \\nexperimentally studied by measuring the amine loss, alkalinity change, ammonia yield, and degradation product. \\nThere is a linear relationship between amine loss against alkalinity change and ammonia yield, indicating that \\nthe degradation product either loss reactivity for CO2 absorption or emit out as the small molecule. The results \\nhave shown that amine stability generally increased with amine order and stronger steric hindrance effect. Most \\nprimary and secondary amines showed more than 40 % amine loss after 336 h degradation experiment, while \\nmost of tertiary amines showed less than 10 % amine loss. This may be due to the exposed amine groups of \\nprimary and secondary amines. The oxidative degradation mechanism was studied based on density functional \\ntheory (DFT) calculations.   \\nexplained by hydrogen abstraction mechanism (Rosenblatt et al., 1967; \\nSmith & Mann, 1969) or electron abstraction mechanism (Goff & \\nRochelle, 2004). Oxidative degradation products are of large quantity \\nand can be divided into two categories: general products and solvent- \\nspecific products (Vevelstad et al., 2023). The oxidative degradation \\nof all alkanolamines gives general degradation products, which include \\nammonia, organic acids, aldehydes, and smaller alkylamines (Fre\\xad\\ndriksen & Jens, 2013). Solvent-specific degradation products are related \\nto amine molecular structure and include larger amines (such as di\\xad\\namines), amines with cyclic structures (such as imidazole, piperazinone, \\nand imidazolidone), amino acids, amides, nitrosamines, nitramines, and \\netc. (Vevelstad et al., 2023). Amine stability is a key aspect to be \\nconsidered before conducting large-scale testing or implementing new \\namines. Therefore, oxidation stability and thermal stability should be \\nconsidered in the early stages of solvent development. \\nThis work studied the oxidative degradation of fourteen amines. \\nAmine oxidation experiments were carried out under harsh conditions, \\nincluding higher concentrations of O2 and dissolved iron to accelerate \\nthe degradation process. The oxidative degradation experiments of \\nstructurally varied amines were carried out under the same experi\\xad\\nmental conditions. The amine loss, alkalinity loss and ammonia emission \\nwere measured to evaluate amine oxidative stability. The effects of \\namine structure on the oxidative stability were assessed, including \\namine order and steric hindrance. Ionizable degradation products \\nincluding formate, nitrate, nitrite, and oxalate were analyzed. Density \\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations were used to deepen the under\\xad\\nstanding of the oxidative degradation mechanism of the studied amine. \\n2. Materials and methods \\n2.1. Chemicals \\nAll solutions were prepared using deionized water produced by ultra- \\npure water purification system, which was purchased from Dongguan \\nTaoshi Water Treatment Equipment Co., Ltd. Carbon dioxide (CO2, \\n99.99 %) and Oxygen (O2, 99.99 %) gas were provided by Changsha \\nMind Gases Co., Ltd. Methanol (CH3OH, ≥99.7 %), sodium oxalate \\n(Na2C2O4, ≥99.8 %), sodium nitrate (NaNO3, ≥99.0 %), sodium nitrite \\n(NaNO2, ≥99.0 %), formaldehyde aqueous solution (CH2O, 37 ~ 40 %), \\nsulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95 %~98 %), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99.5 \\n%) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ferrous \\nsulfate (FeSO4, 98 %), sodium formate (HCOONa, 99.5 %), and 1,2-Pro\\xad\\npanediol (C3H8O2, 99.5 %) were purchased from Macklin. Benzyl \\nalcohol (C7H8O, 99 %) was acquired from Aladdin. Mass flow controllers \\nwere provided by Beijing Sevenstar Flow Co., Ltd. All chemicals were \\nused without further purification. \\n2.2. Oxidative degradation experiments \\n2.2.1. Preparation of amine solution \\nThe concentrations of primary and secondary amines were 5 \\nmol⋅L−1, while the concentration of tertiary amine was 4 mol⋅L−1. To \\navoid the AMP sedimentation after CO2 absorption, the concentration of \\nAMP was set to 4 mol⋅L−1. The amine solution was preloaded to 0.4 mol \\nCO2 per mol amine. \\n2.2.2. Experimental process of oxidative degradation \\nAs shown in Fig. 1, oxidative degradation experiments were carried \\nout at simulated absorber conditions in 250 mL three-necked flask with \\nmagnetic stirrer and condenser. The temperature was controlled using a \\nwater bath. Two mass flow controllers (MFCs) were calibrated and used \\nto regulate gas composition. After the gas mixing, a water saturator was \\nemployed to pre-saturate the gas mixture with water. The gas mixture \\nthen entered six three-necked flasks through gas dispersion tube with 30 \\n~ 50 µm of pore size. Rotameters were adopted to distribute gas flow to \\neach three-necked flask, which contained aqueous amine solution and \\nFeSO4. The water bath-cooled Graham condensers were set above the \\nflasks to mitigate solvent loss. In addition, quantitative water makeup \\nwas applied. Ammonia (NH3) generated during the oxidative degrada\\xad\\ntion experiment was absorbed by l mol⋅L−1 H2SO4 solution. All the \\noxidative degradation experiments were performed for two weeks, with \\nsamples taken out at 12, 24, 36, 48, 168, and 336 h, respectively. \\n2.2.3. Reaction conditions \\nThe initial gas composition was designed for the oxidative degra\\xad\\ndation of primary and secondary amines to maintain the loading at 0.4 \\nmol CO2⋅mol amine−1. For this, the gas composition of 98 % O2 and 2 % \\nCO2 was adopted. However, this CO2 pressure was not enough to \\nmaintain the loading of tertiary amine (Buvik et al., 2021). Therefore, \\nthe oxidative degradation experiments of tertiary amines were carried \\nout with a total of 20 mL⋅min−1 gas mixture containing 83.5 % O2 and \\n16.5 % CO2. The total gas flow of 20 mL⋅min−1 was applied to each \\nthree-necked flask. Each flask contained 200 mL aqueous amine solution \\nand 0.5 mmol⋅L−1 FeSO4. The reaction temperature was maintained at \\n60℃. The solubility of FeSO4 in both 3AP and MEA solutions were tested \\nbefore conducting oxidative degradation experiment. The solution was \\nunder ultrasonic for 2 h, and then stand overnight. Sulfate concentration \\nwas analyzed by anion chromatography to calculate FeSO4 solubility. \\n2.3. Analytical methods \\n2.3.1. Gas chromatography analysis \\nGas chromatography (GC) was used for analysis of amine concen\\xad\\ntrations, which were calculated using the internal standard method. For \\nMEA and MDEA, 1,2-propanediol (C3H8O2) was adopted as an internal \\nstandard, while for other amines, benzyl alcohol (C7H8O) was employed \\nas an internal standard. The degraded solvent (0.5 mL), methanol (2 \\nmL), and internal standard reagents (0.1 g) were placed in a 5 mL bo\\xad\\nrosilicate glass vial and the mixed solutions were injected into gas \\nchromatography through 1 µL microliter syringes. Analyses were com\\xad\\nplete using FULI 9790II gas chromatograph equipped with FID detector. \\nA SE-54 capillary column (25 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 µm) with nitrogen \\ncarrier gas was adopted for the separation of degradation products with \\nan initial column temperature of 140℃ for 2 min. The column tem\\xad\\nperature was then increased to 240℃ with heating rate of 30℃⋅min−1 \\nand held for another 2 min. All samples were tested in replicates 3 to 5 \\ntimes, and the average value was taken to calculate the amine concen\\xad\\ntration. Amine loss was calculated by equation (1): \\nCloss (%) = Cinitial −Cend\\nCinitial\\n× 100%\\n(1) \\nWhere Closs – amine loss; Cinitial – initial amine concentration, \\nmol⋅L−1; Cend – amine concentration after oxidative degradation \\nexperiment, mol⋅L−1. \\n2.3.2. Alkalinity analysis \\nThe alkalinity loss was measured by 916 Ti-Touch Potentiometric \\nTitrator purchased from Metrohm. Amine solution (0.3 g) and deionized \\nwater (20 mL) were placed in a beaker and titrated with standard hy\\xad\\ndrochloric acid (HCl) soluiotn. The consumption of HCl solution was \\nQ.

Volatile compound analysis \\nThe NH3 generated during oxidative degradation was absorbed by \\nH2SO4 to form NH4\\n+. The method for determining the concentration of \\nNH4\\n+ in H2SO4 solution was as follow: Firstly, a few drops of phenol\\xad\\nphthalein, 0.5 mL of H2SO4 solution and 10 mL of deionized water and \\nwere placed in a conical flask and titrated with standard NaOH solution. \\nThe consumption volume of NaOH was denoted as V1. Then, another 0.5 \\nmL H2SO4 solution, 2 mL formaldehyde aqueous solution (CH2O), 10 mL \\ndeionized water, and a few drops of phenolphthalein were placed in a \\nconical flask. The flask was under magnetic stirring for 5 min to convert \\nNH4\\n+ into hexamethylene tetraammonium cations ((CH2)6N4H+) and \\nH+. The reaction equations are shown in equations (3), (4), and (5). The \\nmixed solution was then titrated with standard NaOH solution and the \\nconsumption of NaOH solution was recorded as V2.

Ion chromatography analysis \\nFormate, nitrate, nitrite, oxalate, and sulfate were quantified by ion \\nchromatography (IC) using a Shine CIC-D100 system equipped with a \\nSH-AP-1 analytical column (4 × 250 mm), SH-GP-2 guard column (4 ×\\n50 mm), conductivity detection, and SHY-A-7 suppressor operated at \\n35℃. The concentration of NaOH eluent was 14 mmol⋅L−1. Anion \\nstandards were prepared using HCOONa, NaNO3, NaNO2, Na2C2O4, and \\nNa2SO4 in the concentration range from 1 to 50 mg⋅L−1. The degraded \\namine samples were diluted between 1:10 and 1:200 with deionized \\nwater, depending on the degree of loss of amine concentration. \\n2.3.6. CO2 loading measurement \\nThe CO2 loading of amine solution was determined by the device \\nshown in the Fig. S1. The flask contained amine solution, deionized \\nwater, and methyl orange solution. The liquid level was recorded as V1 \\nin measuring burette before titrating. The amine solution was titrated \\nwith standard HCl solution, and an excess HCl solution was used to \\nensure complete CO2 release. The liquid level was recorded as V2 in \\nmeasuring burette after titrating.

Results and discussion \\n3.1. Oxidative degradation \\nThe oxidative degradation leads to amine loss, alkalinity loss, and \\nNH3 emission. In addition, physical property (such as viscosity) is \\naffected by the change of solvent composition. The normalized con\\xad\\ncentration of all the studied amines throughout 336 h of oxidative ex\\xad\\nperiments is shown in Fig. 2 and Table S1. As can been seen from Figs. 2, \\n3AP and AMP show significant less amine loss and NH3 yield among the \\nprimary and secondary amine, respectively. The concentration of other \\nfour primary amines, MEA, 1AP, 2AP, and AMB, decreased rapidly and \\nfound to have over 45 % amine losses after 336 h of oxidative degra\\xad\\ndation experiment. The total NH3 concentrations in their products were \\nhigher than 55 mmol⋅molamine,initial\\n−1\\n. Additionally, two secondary \\namines, MAE and EAE, showed amine losses of greater than 40 %, which \\nis similar to that of the four primary amines mentioned above. However, \\nthe total NH3 concentrations in their degradation products were less \\nthan 30 mmol⋅molamine,initial\\n−1\\n. It was shown that the volatile products of \\nsecondary and tertiary amines oxidative degradation consist of \\nmethylamine and dimethylamine, in addition to NH3 (Lepaumier et al., \\n2009b). As shown in Fig. 2 (b), all tertiary amines except 1DMA2P kept a \\nslow degradation rate and had less than 10 % amine loss after 336 h of \\noxidative degradation experiment. The total NH3 concentrations in their \\nproducts were less than 8 mmol⋅molamine,initial\\n−1\\n, showing the excellent \\nstability on oxidative degradation of the tertiary amines. A compre\\xad\\nhensive comparison of amine stability related to its molecule structure \\nwill be discussed in the following section. \\nAlkalinity is an indicating parameter of the ability of amine solution \\nto neutralize protons. The higher alkalinity indicates a better capability \\nto absorb more CO2. Viscosity is also an important parameter of amine \\nsolution. It affects the mass and heat transfer in the CO2 capture system. \\nAs a result, alkalinity, CO2 loading, and viscosity of the amine solution \\nbefore and after oxidative degradation experiment were studied in this \\nwork. The alkalinities and CO2 loadings of all the studied amines after \\n336 h of oxidative degradation experiment are summarized in Table S2. \\nMost of the studied amines can maintain the CO2 loading greater than \\n0.3 mol CO2⋅mol amine−1. Fig. 3 (a) shows a comparison of amine loss \\nand alkalinity loss of all the studied amines. It was observed that the \\nlevel of amine losses was close to that of alkalinity losses, suggesting that \\nthere are few alkaline substances in their liquid oxidative degradation \\nproducts. Among the studied primary and secondary amines, only 3AP \\nand AMP had less than 10 % alkalinity loss, while the others showed \\nalkalinity loss over 35 %. This observation is consistent with the amine \\nloss data presented in Fig. 2 (a). Interestingly, all the studied tertiary \\namines (excepting 1DMA2P) had less than 10 % alkalinity loss. Fig. 3 (b) \\nshows a linear relationship between amine loss and NH3 yield. The re\\xad\\nsults indicated that the degradation product either loss reactivity for CO2 \\nabsorption or emit out as the small molecule, such as NH3. \\nThe viscosity of amine solvent affects the interphase mass transfer \\nand diffusion process of CO2 in the liquid phase, thereby affecting the \\nFig. 2. Normalized amine concentrations of primary and secondary amines (a), normalized amine concentrations of tertiary amines (b), and total NH3 concentrations \\nin the products (c) throughout 336 h of oxidative degradation experiment (Quantification made by GC and corrected for sampling loss). \\nQ. Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\nChemical Engineering Science 299 (2024) 120458\\n5\\ncapture efficiency of CO2. Table S3 shows the viscosity of amine solvent \\nafter 336 h of oxidative degradation experiments. It can be seen that all \\namine solutions showed a decrease in viscosity. This result indicates the \\nchange of solvent composition. The 3AP solution showed a less viscosity \\ndrop compared with the primary and secondary amines, owning to the \\nlower amine loss and the higher CO2 loading of 3AP solution after the \\ndegradation experiment. Although most of the tertiary amine shows a \\nstrong resistance to the oxidative degradation, it shows an apparent drop \\nof solution viscosity due to the decrease of CO2 loading. In an actual \\ncontinuous cyclical operation, the solution viscosity can be elevated by \\namine make-up and accumulation of the amine degraded products. In \\nthe practical application, the viscosity will increase when solvent make- \\nup is applied, and by-products accumulate in the degraded solvent. \\n3.2. The influence of amine structure on the oxidative degradation \\nThe influence of amine structure variation (such as steric hindrance, \\namine order, chain length, and hydroxyethyl substitution) on the \\noxidative degradation is studied by comparing MEA and the other \\nthirteen alkanolamines. Amine losses of all the studied amines are \\nshown in Fig. 4. \\nThe effect of amine order on the oxidative degradation is summa\\xad\\nrized in Fig. 5. The benchmark MEA with 51.2 % amine loss was used as \\na baseline for the comparison. As can be seen from Table 1, the \\nstructures of MAE (secondary amine) and DMEA (tertiary amine) are \\nsimilar to that of MEA. One difference is MAE and DMEA have one and \\ntwo additional methyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom. From the \\nexperiment, amine loss of DMEA (5.5 %) was lower than that of MAE \\n(41.5 %) and MEA (51.2 %), respectively (see Fig. 4). A similar behavior \\ncan be observed in the case of MEA, EAE, and DEEA (in which EAE and \\nDEEA have one and two ethyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom, as \\npresented in Table 1). These observations indicate that the amine sta\\xad\\nbility increase with the number of alkyl group attached to the nitrogen \\natom. Additionally, it was found that most of the primary amines are \\nmore prone to oxidative degradation than highly substituting amines, \\npossibly because of the exposed amine groups (Buvik et al., 2021). For \\nthe secondary amine, an extension of methyl group in MAE to ethyl \\ngroup in EAE resulted in the increase of amine loss from 41.5 % to 47.1 \\n%, as given in Fig. 4. Lepaumier et al. (2010) showed that a preliminary \\ndemethylation reaction is required for tertiary amines to cause signifi\\xad\\ncant degradation, which increases the chemical stability of tertiary \\namines. In this work, most of the tertiary amine solution (including, \\nMDEA, TEA, DMPA, DMEA, and DEEA) exhibited amine loss less than \\n10 %. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in amine loss \\namong the studied tertiary amine solutions regarding the hydroxyethyl \\nsubstitution. \\nIn addition to an amine order, a steric hindrance also affects the \\namine stability against oxidative degradation. Fig. S2–S17 show the 13C \\nNMR spectroscopy of all the studied amine solutions, which is used to \\nobtain the structure information of their functional groups and sub\\xad\\nstituents. A comparison is made based on the steric hindrance effect of \\ndifferent amines, as shown in Fig. 6. Compared to MEA, 2AP has an \\nFig. 3.

From 51.2 % amine loss of \\nMEA, the amine loss of 2AP and 1AP reduced to 48.1 % and 47.0 %, \\nrespectively. This indicates that the presence of an additional methyl \\ngroup on the α-carbon or β-carbon slightly increases the amine stability. \\nThe amine groups of 1AP and 2AP are shielded by steric hindrance ef\\xad\\nfect, which protect molecules from free radical attack and reduce the \\nchain propagation reaction. This is beneficial for the termination of free \\nradical reactions. \\nIn the case of AMB, the amine molecule has an additional ethyl group \\non α-carbon respecting MEA (Table 1). The steric hindrance effect of \\nAMB is then stronger than that of 2AP and 1AP (which have one methyl \\ngroup on the α-carbon or β-carbon in the structure). This can further lead \\nto a decline of amine loss of AMB (45.5 %) respecting that of MEA (51.2 \\n%). In the case of AMP, the two additional methyl groups on the \\nα-carbon provided a strong steric hindrance effect that destabilized the \\ncarbamate and shifted the reaction products from carbamate to bicar\\xad\\nbonate and carbonate (Ciftja et al., 2014). Owning to the significant \\ndifference in a form of reaction product, AMP solution exhibited an \\nexcellent stability with only 4.1 % amine loss. This is comparable with \\ntertiary amine, which can only generate protonated amine, bicarbonate, \\nand carbonate upon CO2 absorption. The excellent stability of AMP and \\ntertiary amines under oxidative conditions indicates that oxidative \\ndegradation take place through carbamates, rather than the direct re\\xad\\naction of amines with oxidant. In addition, the steric hindrance of AMP \\nmakes it difficult to form free radical on α-carbon, preventing the \\ncleavage of C-N bonds (Lepaumier et al., 2009b). To conclude, the \\nadditional alkyl group on the main chain of primary and secondary \\namine molecule provides stronger steric hindrance effect and leads to \\nstronger stability against oxidative degradation. \\nIn conclusion, primary amines are more prone to oxidative degra\\xad\\ndation than highly substituting tertiary amines, possibly because of the \\nexposed amine groups. Steric hindrance plays a vital role in the stability \\nof oxidative degradation. The presence of an additional substituent \\ngroup, methyl or ethyl group, on the α-carbon or β-carbon relative to the \\namine group increases oxidative stability. The amine groups of sterically \\nTable 1 \\nSummary of structures and purities of the studied amines.  \\nCompound \\nAbbreviation \\nStructure \\nCAS number \\nPurity \\nManufacturer \\nMonoethanolamine \\nMEA \\n141-43-5 \\n99 % \\nAladdin \\nDL-1-Amino-2-propanol \\n1AP \\n78-6-6 \\n99 % \\nRhawn \\nDL-Alaninol \\n2AP \\n6168-72-5 \\n98 % \\nMacklin \\n3-Amino-1-propanol \\n3AP \\n156-87-6 \\n99 % \\nAladdin \\n2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol \\nAMP \\n124-68-5 \\n≥95 % \\nMeryer \\n2-Amino-1-butano \\nAMB \\n96-20-8 \\n97 % \\nAladdin \\n2-(Methylamino)ethanol \\nMAE \\n109-83-1 \\n99 % \\nAladdin \\n2-(Ethylamino)ethanol \\nEAE \\n110-73-6 \\n98 % \\nAladdin \\n2-Dimethylaminoethano \\nDMEA \\n108-01-0 \\n99 % \\nAladdin \\n2-(Diethylamino)ethanol \\nDEEA \\n100-37-8 \\n99 % \\nMacklin \\n3-Dimethylamino-1-propanol \\nDMPA \\n3179-63-3 \\n99 % \\nAladdin \\nN-Methyldiethanolamine \\nMDEA \\n105-59-9 \\n99 % \\nMeryer \\nTriethanolamine \\nTEA \\n102-71-6 \\n98 % \\nRhawn \\n1-Dimethylamino-2-propanol \\n1DMA2P \\n108-16-7 \\n98 % \\nMeryer  \\nFig. 6.

If the hydroxyl group in tertiary amine has a \\nrelatively suitable distance from the amine group, usually spacing two or \\nthree carbon atoms, an intramolecular hydrogen bond will be formed \\nbetween a nitrogen atom and a hydrogen atom. This is a more stable \\nmolecular configuration (Cacela et al., 2001; Puxty et al., 2009). As \\nshown in Fig. 7, intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed within \\n1DMA2P molecule. However, the steric hindrance introduced by the \\nadditional methyl group on β-carbon reduces the stability of hydrogen \\nbond, resulting the cleavage of chemical bond and the formation of \\nacetone and dimethylamine (Buvik et al., 2021). Therefore, steric hin\\xad\\ndrance reduces the oxidative stability of tertiary amines that form \\nintramolecular hydrogen bonds. In addition, 3AP, which is a linear \\nprimary amine without steric hindrance effect, showed significant lower \\namine loss that is comparable with tertiary amine or primary amine with \\nstrong steric hindrance effect (shown in Fig. 4). To understand such \\nbehavior, more discussion will be provided in the following section \\naccompanied with degradation products identification and DFT \\ncalculation. \\n3.3. Oxidative degradation products \\nAnion IC analysis was used to quantify amine degradation products \\n(i.e., formate, nitrate, nitrite, and oxalate). The information of other \\nanions (e.g., acetate and glycolate) was not available as they cannot be \\ndistinguished with each other in IC spectrum. Fig. 8 and Table S4 show \\nthat the total concentrations of formate, nitrate, nitrite, and oxalate are \\nless than 2 mmol⋅molamine,initial\\n−1 \\nfor AMP, 3AP, and tertiary amines. This \\nis consistent with the amine loss results (shown in Fig. 2). The concen\\xad\\ntration is normalized based on the initial amine concentration. The rest \\nof the amine solvents generated over 15 mmol⋅molamine,initial\\n−1 \\nanionic \\ncompounds. Formate is one of the most common primary products of \\namine oxidation degradation. It is found in all amine solvents and \\naccounted for more than 30 % of all measured anionic compounds. \\nFormic acid is mainly formed through the oxidation of aldehydes or \\noxalic acid (Lepaumier et al., 2009b). Oxalate concentration is much \\nlower than formate concentration, partially because oxalic acid can be \\noxidized to form formic acid. Nitrate and nitrite are mainly present in \\nthe oxidative degradation products of amines with relatively high NH3 \\nyield (e.g., MEA, EAE, AMB, 1AP, and 2AP) because nitrate and nitrite \\nare formed through the oxidation of NH3 at gas–liquid interface. \\nFig. 9 and Table S5 show the concentration of formate, nitrite, ni\\xad\\ntrate, and oxalate in the products of MEA and 3AP as a function of time. \\nFormate is the main ionizable product of the oxidative degradation of \\nMEA and 3AP. For MEA, the initial formate formation rate was slow, and \\nthe formate concentration at 48 h was only 1.3 mmol⋅molamine,initial\\n−1\\n. \\nThere are few numbers of free radicals at the initial stage of oxidative \\ndegradation reaction, resulting in a slow reaction rate. Formate con\\xad\\ncentrations then increased to 11.7 mmol⋅molamine,initial\\n−1 \\nand 32.2 \\nmmol⋅molamine,initial\\n−1 \\nat 168 and 336 h, respectively, showing a signifi\\xad\\ncant increase in formation rate. The formation rates of nitrate and nitrite \\nwere relatively stable because of the limitation of the NH3 concentration \\nat the gas–liquid interface. For 3AP, the concentration of nitrate and \\nnitrite in the oxidation degradation products were less than 0.02 \\nmmol⋅molamine,initial\\n−1 \\nduring the whole experiments, while formate con\\xad\\ncentration increased slowly. \\n3.4. DFT calculation \\nIt is generally accepted that amine oxidative degradation is triggered \\nby O2 radicals directly or a free radical initiated by O2 in flue gas \\n(Vevelstad et al., 2023). There are two types of mechanisms of oxidative \\ndegradation where primary amine with heteroatoms degrades via \\nhydrogen abstraction from α-carbon (Goff & Rochelle, 2004) and ter\\xad\\ntiary amine go through electron abstraction mechanism (Chi & Rochelle, \\n2002; Goff & Rochelle, 2004). Fig. 10 shows the hydrogen abstraction \\nmechanism for the oxidative degradation of MEA and 3AP. The reaction \\nmechanism of 3AP is adapted from that of MEA. The initiation reaction \\nin the hydrogen abstraction mechanism is the ionization of alkanol\\xad\\namines in aqueous solutions (Lepaumier et al., 2009b). MEA can form a \\ncyclic structure by hydrogen bonding between HN–O or OH–N. Free \\nradicals can abstract a proton from N atoms or C atoms to form amine \\nradicals. The newly formed amine radical can transfer the radical \\nthrough the cyclic structure, eventually leading to the cleavage of N-C \\nbonds, resulting in degradation products such as ammonia and acetal\\xad\\ndehyde radicals. Acetaldehyde radicals can abstract protons from other \\namine molecules to produce amine radicals and acetaldehyde. In terms \\nof mechanism verification, some molecular simulation studies have \\nverified the correctness of the transition state of the cyclic structure \\nformed by MEA (Alejandre et al., 2000). \\nDFT modeling the formation of distinct radicals from MEA and 3AP \\nwas carried out according to the above reaction mechanism. Ethyl \\nradical (Et•) and peroxy radical (O2\\n−•) were used as the free radicals that \\nreact with amine (Parks et al., 2021). Tables S6 and S7 show the free \\nenergies for the formation of distinct radicals from MEA and 3AP, \\nrespectively. The free energy for the reaction of MEA and Et• is smaller \\nthan that for the reaction of MEA and O2\\n−•, showing a greater predis\\xad\\nposition to this reaction. As can be seen from Figs. 11 and 12, the free \\nenergy for the formation of amine radical on α-C after reaction with Et•\\nFig. 7.

The reaction energy barriers for the formation of 3AP rad\\xad\\nicals at all sites are higher than those for the formation of MEA radicals. \\nIn addition, the free energies of the formed MEA radicals are generally \\nlower than those of the formed 3AP radicals. Therefore, the formation of \\nMEA radicals is more advantageous in terms of kinetics and \\nthermodynamics. \\nTables 2 and 3 show the results of ΔH and ΔG for the chain propa\\xad\\ngation reaction of both MEA radicals and 3AP radicals according to \\nhydrogen abstraction mechanism. It can be seen that ΔH and ΔG of the \\namine radical reactions on all the sites except for on N site are negative, \\nshowing an exothermic and spontaneous reaction. Smaller ΔH and ΔG \\nare observed for the chain propagation reactions of 3AP radicals than \\nthose of MEA radicals, suggesting that 3AP reaction products is ther\\xad\\nmodynamically more stable. \\nThe studies suggest that the excellent oxidative stability of 3AP \\nmight be attributed to the fact that metals did not catalyze oxidative \\ndegradation for their insolubility in 3AP solution (Liu et al., 2014). In \\norder to determine whether the metal ions solubility affects 3AP \\noxidation degradation, the solubility of FeSO4 in both MEA and 3AP \\nsolutions was tested, respectively. The FeSO4 solubility in 5 mol⋅L−1 \\nMEA and 3AP solutions at 25℃ are 44.3 and 44.7 mg⋅L−1, respectively. \\nThis suggests that the excellent stability of 3AP is independent of metal \\nions solubility. \\nIn conclusion, since 3AP is more stable than MEA against oxidative \\ndegradation, the formation of distinct radicals may dominate the amine \\ndegradation instead of the chain propagation reaction. \\n4. Conclusion \\nThis work focused on the influence of different amine structural \\ncharacteristics on amine oxidative stability. Fourteen amines varying in \\namine order, steric hindrance, chain length, and the number of \\nhydroxyethyl groups were studied under harsh oxidative conditions. \\nAmine oxidative stability generally increases with increasing order from \\nprimary, secondary and tertiary amines, respectively. AMP with steric \\nhindrance in molecular structure exhibits excellent stability with only \\n4.1 % amine loss, which is comparable with tertiary amines. The \\nexcellent stability of AMP and tertiary amines under oxidative condi\\xad\\ntions indicates that oxidative degradation may take place through \\nFig. 9.

Formic acid is mainly formed through the oxidation of al\\xad\\ndehydes or oxalic acid. Oxalate was mainly present in the oxidative \\ndegradation products of amines with relatively high amine loss. Nitrate \\nand nitrite originating from NH3 were mainly present in the oxidative \\ndegradation products of amines with relatively high NH3 yield. \\nDFT modeling the reaction process of free radicals from MEA and \\n3AP were carried out according to hydrogen abstraction mechanism. \\nThe calculation results show that the formation of MEA radicals is more \\nadvantageous in terms of kinetics and thermodynamics than the for\\xad\\nmation of 3AP radicals, while 3AP reaction products is thermodynami\\xad\\ncally more stable. The calculation results combined with experimental \\nconclusions indicate that the formation of distinct radicals may domi\\xad\\nnate the amine degradation instead of the chain propagation reaction. \\nAmine stability is a key aspect to be considered before conducting \\nlarge-scale testing or implementing new amines.

        "Abstract": "'A B S T R A C T   \\nThe global deployment of aqueous amine absorbents for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture is hindered by their high \\nenergy consumption. A potential solution to this challenge lies in the utilization of non-aqueous amine systems, \\nwhich offer energy-efficient alternatives. However, they are prone to form precipitation during CO2 absorption \\nprocess, which limits their application. Combining experimental and theoretical studies, we found that the \\nelectrostatic potential of carbamate, instead of van der Waals force, is a major factor controlling the precipita\\xad\\ntion, and hydrogen bonds can effectively reduce the electrostatic potential of carbamate and prevent precipi\\xad\\ntation. Single solvent screening experiments have also demonstrated that the absorption rate is closely related to \\nthe viscosity of the organic solvent and the affinity of the functional group for CO2. The polar solvents (Dime\\xad\\nthylformamide (DMF), Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and N-Methylformamide (NMF)) exhibit higher absorption \\nrates, but suffer from issues of precipitation. Hydroxyl group riched solvents (Ethylene glycol (EG) and Glycerol) \\nexhibit lower absorption rate, but they don’t have the issue of precipitation. Based on these findings, several \\nnovel 2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP)-based non-aqueous absorbents have been developed aiming at \\nreducing the energy penalty, and improving CO2 absorption and desorption performance. Among these absor\\xad\\nbents, AMP-EG-DMF (4–3) exhibits maximum CO2 absorption rate and absorption capacity of 9.91 g-CO2/(kg- \\nsoln.⋅min.) and 122 g-CO2/(kg-soln.), respectively, which are 64.1% and 28.4% higher than those of 30 wt% \\nAMP aqueous solution, respectively. Additionally, compared to 30 wt% MEA, the energy consumption of AMP- \\nEG-DMF (4–3) shows 46.30% reduction. The addition of EG effectively improves the electrostatic solubility of \\nAMP-carbamate by increasing the number and strength of hydrogen bonds, thus avoiding the generation of \\nprecipitation. The final product species and reaction mechanism were analysed by using 13C and 1H NMR, In-situ \\nATR-FTIR, and quantum chemical calculation.

The non-aqueous amines reported in literature possess a high energy ef-\\nficiency for CO2 capture from flue gases, they struggle with gas streams containing ultra-dilute CO2, like air, due\\nto poor absorption kinetics. This study developed novel 2-PE (2-piperidineethanol)/APZ (Aminoethylpiperazine)\\nbased CO2 absorbents to address these problems. The experiments and MD simulation results showed that the 2-\\nPE/APZ-based absorbents possessed a superior absorption performance both in flue gas and air. Among the\\ndeveloped absorbents, when 2-PE/APZ mixed with DMF (Dimethylformamide), the CO2 loading reached to\\n1.004 mol/mole, as the theoretical maximum. In DAC tests, 87.31 % CO2 from the air was captured in 24 h\\nexperiments. The regeneration heat duty of 2-PE/APZ/DMF decreased to 1.694 KJ/g CO2, a 55.89 % reduction\\ncompared to the benchmark 30 wt% MEA. The CO2 absorption/desorption mechanism was analysed by NMR, In-\\nsitu FT-IR, and DFT calculation. It indicated that this significant improvement in CO2 absorption performance\\nand the reduction in energy consumption are due to the synergistic effect of 2-PE and APZ. During CO2 ab-\\nsorption, CO2 reacts with APZ forming APZ zwitterion rapidly, then deprotonation to the 2-PE. The formation of\\nprotonated 2-PEH+ ion pairs with APZCOO- reduces hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces among the amine-\\nCO2 complex, facilitating easy regeneration at mild conditions while maintaining high reactivity. The combi-\\nnation of theoretical and experimental results indicates that 2-PE/APZ-based absorbents can serve as a promising\\nalternative for carbon capture from flue gas to air with low energy usage.'"

For\\nthe aqueous MEA system, 36 H2O, 1 MEA, and 1 CO2 were placed in a\\ncubic periodic box with the side length of 10.78 Å corresponding to about\\n8.6 wt% aqueous MEA solution; for the nonaqueous MEA simulation sys-\\ntem, 15 ethanol, 1 MEA, and 1 CO2 were placed with the side length of\\n12.0 Å, corresponding to the nonaqueous MEA solution with the MEA\\nmass concentration of around 8.1 wt%. As illustrated in Figure 8A, in the\\naqueous MEA solution, at the initial state where the N atom of MEA\\nforms a hydrogen bond with H atom in neighboring H2O, our simulations\\npredicted dN C = 2.8 Å and dN H = 2.0 Å. At the transition state, dN C\\ndecreased to 1.9 Å while dN H increased to 3.0 Å (indicating the broken\\nhydrogen bond between H2O and MEA). And the dN C further decreased\\nto 1.6 Å at the final state, demonstrating the formation of the N C bond.\\nFirst, we calculated the energy barrier for MEA-zwitterion in\\naqueous solution (water as solvate) to verify the reliability of our\\nsimulations. The energy barrier was predicted to be 7.54 kcal/mol,\\nwhich is was very close to the energy barrier calculated by Yoon\\net al.42 (7.9 kcal/mol) and by Kim et al.51 (7.67 kcal/mol). Thereaf-\\nter, the energy barrier for the MEA-zwitterion formation in non-\\naqueous (ethanol as solvate) was also predicted to be 5.77 kcal/\\nmol, as shown in Figure 8. The relatively high energy barrier in\\naqueous MEA solutions may suggest that the zwitterion formation\\nin nonaqueous solutions is more kinetic favorable than that in\\naqueous solutions, which is due to the relatively weak hydrogen\\nbonding in ethanol solutions.52 The energy barrier can inflect the\\nreaction rate of the elementary reaction at some exact, while the\\nlower energy barrier for MEA-zwitterion formation in nonaqueous\\nMEA solutions lead to the higher reaction constant in nonaqueous\\nsystems (k2,MEA,non > k2,MEA,aq). Therefore, our simulation results were\\nin well agreement with our experimental results, that the KZ\\nMEA\\x03MEA,non\\n(3725.3 1/s/(mol/L)2) was higher than the KZ\\nMEA\\x03MEA,non (1916.4 1/s/\\n(mol/L)2) estimated from our kinetic model, as shown in Figure 7A.\\nTo assess the mechanism and the factors that affect the reaction\\nbetween CO2 and AMP in aqueous solutions, we calculated the\\nenergy barrier of direct HCO3\\n\\x03 formation through base-catalyzed\\nhydration mechanism in aqueous AMP solution, taking that in aque-\\nous MDEA solution as a reference.

The predicted FE barrier for the\\nHCO3\\n\\x03 formation through the base-catalyzed hydration mechanism in\\naqueous AMP solutions, was 10.3 kcal/mol, which is very close to the\\n9.6 kcal/mol calculated by Yoon et al.42 and Yamada et al.,21 and also\\ncompatible to the 8.1 kcal/mol calculated by Stowe et al.39 The energy\\nbarrier in aqueous AMP solution (10.3 kcal/mol) is predicted to be higher\\nthan that in aqueous MEA solution (7.54 kcal/mol), which agrees well\\nwith the higher activation energy of CO2 absorption in aqueous AMP\\nsolution (10.31 kcal/mol from Saha et al.53) than that in aqueous MEA\\nsolution (9.56 kcal/mol from Leder54) predicted by experiments. Together,\\nour results confirm the reliability and accuracy of our simulations.\\nCompared to the energy barrier for the formation of AMP-\\nzwitterion in aqueous systems, estimated in the literature (11.7 kcal/\\nmol),42 the predicted energy barrier for the HCO3\\n\\x03 formation was\\nslightly lower. It should be pointed out that in aqueous AMP solutions\\nthe base-catalyzed hydration of CO2 is more kinetic favorable than\\nthe zwitterion formation, which can be explained by the fact that the\\nsteric effect of AMP dominates the reaction by affecting the nucleo-\\nphilicity of N atom55, suppressing the thermal rearrangement of adja-\\ncent H2O molecules.39 Considering the thermal instability of AMP-\\nzwitterion at the same time, our simulation results clearly show that\\nthe base-catalyzed hydration of CO2 play a dominant role in the aque-\\nous AMP solutions.\\nTherefore, our simulation results also verified our experimental\\nresults as discussed earlier, indicating that the reaction mechanisms of\\nCO2 absorption in nonaqueous AMP solutions and aqueous AMP\\nsolution were different and that their kinetic model can be described\\nby the linear relationship and the second-order polynomial relation-\\nship of k0 and the AMP concentration, respectively.\\nOur CPMD-metadynamics simulations estimated the free\\nenergy (FE) barrier of the base-catalyzed hydration of CO2 in aque-\\nous MDEA solutions to be 14.20 kcal/mol; the corresponding FE\\nsurface for the reaction was also illustrated in Figure 10.

A hypothesis model for the non-\\naqueous MEA, AMP, MEA + AMP, MEA + MDEA solutions and the\\naqueous MEA, AMP, MDEA solutions, correlating the measured first-\\norder reaction rate constant to MEA, AMP, MDEA concentration\\nbased on the zwitterion mechanism and base-catalyzed hydration\\nmechanism, was verified to be accurately predicting the experimen-\\ntal data.\\nThe reaction kinetics of CO2 absorption in nonaqueous MEA,\\nnonaqueous MEA + AMP and nonaqueous MEA + MDEA solutions\\nshowed that the concentration of AMP or MDEA led to a positive\\neffect on the measured k0. These effects are related to the reaction\\nmechanisms, in which the two elementary reactions (the zwitterion\\nformation and proton release of zwitterion) are rate controlling pro-\\ncesses, while the AMP and the MDEA take important parts in the later\\nprocess. The experimental results also demonstrated the different\\nreaction kinetics for CO2 absorption in nonaqueous AMP and aque-\\nous AMP solutions, owning to the change of dominated reaction\\nissued by the steric hindered effect on the hydrogen bonding and the\\nrearrangement of neighboring molecules.\\nThe FE barriers for key elementary reactions in CO2 absorption\\nusing nonaqueous and aqueous amine solutions were predicted by\\nAIMD metadynamics simulations. Our simulation results showed that\\nthe FE barrier for the MEA-zwitterion formation in nonaqueous MEA\\nwas lower than that in aqueous MEA, while the FE barrier for the\\nbase-catalyzed hydration of CO2 in aqueous AMP was lower than that\\nin aqueous MDEA. Moreover, compared to the energy barrier for the\\nAMP-zwitterion formation in the aqueous AMP, the lower FE barrier\\nof HCO3\\n\\x03 formation indicated that the base-catalyzed hydration of\\nCO2 was more kinetic favorable. All those simulation results were\\nconsistent with the experimental results and verified our kinetic\\nmodel.\\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\\nQinlan Luo: Conceptualization (lead); visualization (lead); writing –\\noriginal draft (lead).

        "Abstract": "'A B S T R A C T   \\nIn this study, a series of hybrid adsorbent materials (AC@mPEI) with superior selective separation properties of \\nH2S and CO2 are prepared by taking advantage of the differences in reaction mechanisms between H2S and CO2, \\nas well as tertiary amines. Using a straightforward impregnation method, the methylated polyethyleneimine \\n(mPEI) is successfully introduced into the pores of the porous carbon to create the desired hybrid adsorbents. The \\nstrong interaction between the tertiary amine groups and H2S facilitates the selective separation of H2S and CO2 \\ngases. Remarkably, the adsorbent (1:1)AC@mPEI exhibits a substantial H2S adsorption capacity of 5.83 \\nmmol⋅g−1 at 298 K and 1.0 bar and a high separation selectivity of H2S to CO2 (133), which is approximately \\n16.6 times higher than that of the porous carbon supporter. Further investigations, involving adsorption ther\\xad\\nmodynamics, breakthrough experiments, and spectroscopy, confirm that the strong interaction between the \\nhybrid materials and H2S plays a pivotal role in enhancing the separation selectivity of H2S. Additionally, the \\nadsorbed H2S can be well desorbed through vacuum degassing, allowing for multiple cycles of the adsorbent. \\nThis strategy, which leverages differences in gas adsorption mechanisms to fabricate hybrid adsorbents, presents \\nnovel concepts for the development of functional adsorbent materials for selective separation of gases.'"

We complete this\\nwork by evaluating our models and considering the impact of\\nour predictions.\\nWe report the results for the classi\\ue103cation models generated\\nwith MACCS \\ue103ngerprints, CCS \\ue103ngerprints and Mordred\\ndescriptors against absorption capacity in units of (molCO2\\nmolN−1).\\nThere are 98 molecules in our absorption capacity data set\\ndenoted as ccs-98, classi\\ue103ed to binary groups. Class 1 represents\\nhigher values and class 0 represents lower values of absorption\\ncapacity. The molecules are classi\\ue103ed based upon the nitrogen\\ncentric organic functionalities they contain. Both primary and\\nsecondary amines are thought to react with CO2 through\\na mechanism requiring two amine molecules to complete the\\nreaction. Therefore, a primary or secondary amine has a theo-\\nretical absorption capacity of 0.5 per primary or secondary\\namine group. Tertiary amines are thought to react in a one to\\none mechanism therefore have a theoretical absorption capacity\\nof 1.0 per tertiary amine group. We classify molecules by\\nsumming up these expected contributions per amine group. For\\nsp2 nitrogens in rings the pKa tends to be lower than for amines\\ntherefore it is likely a much less active functionality. sp2 nitro-\\ngens in rings are the only containing functionality in the\\nmolecules the molecule is assigned a theoretical capacity of 0.5,\\nhowever, if the molecule contains one or more amines then the\\ntheoretical capacity is set to the values associated with the\\namines. Functions to generate these classes are provided in the\\nCCS \\ue103ngerprint library https://github.com/Jammyzx1/Carbon-\\ncapture-\\ue103ngerprint-generation. Where mixtures of primary or\\nsecondary with tertiary amines arise we apply a weighting\\nbased upon the number of tertiary amine groups, as both of\\nthe proposed amine reaction routes are possible and can be\\ncompetitive in terms of the kinetics. We therefore down scale\\nthe tertiary contributions to 0.5. If the approximate expected\\nvalue for absorption capacity is below the experimental\\nabsorption capacity then class 0 is assigned to the molecule.\\nIf the experimental absorption capacity is greater than or\\nequal to the approximate expected value then class 1 is\\nassigned to the molecule. From the ccs-98 data set 71 mole-\\ncules are class 0, and 27 molecules are class 1.\\nThe two classes are highly imbalanced. To achieve better\\nperformance in the models, we generate additional sampling\\npoints for the minority class using the Synthetic Minority Over-\\nSampling Technique (SMOTE)93 for non-categorical features\\nand Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Nominal\\n(SMOTEN)93 for categorical features. This is implemented in the\\nimbalanced learn Python package (version 0.9.0). In both cases,\\nthese methods select the \\ue103ve nearest minority class neighbours\\nin feature space to the kth example minority point, choose at\\nrandom one of the \\ue103ve and generate a synthetic sample point\\nalong the connecting line between the example point and the\\nrandom neighbour. Note that the methods have no information\\nabout the majority class.\\nSMOTE provide a better balance between the classes, hence\\nimproving the learning of a decision boundary. We apply the\\nSMOTE algorithms to each training set in the k-fold cross vali-\\ndation independently to avoid data leakage from the test sets.\\nWe note that pre-computing the SMOTE synthetic points prior\\nFig. 8\\nConfusion matrices and ROC curves for the balanced data against absorption capacity classiﬁcation using the Mordred chemical features.\\nConfusion matrices calculated over all external folds.\\n536 | Digital Discovery, 2024, 3, 528–543\\n© 2024 The Author(s).

We explored the impact of this in our work and\\nfound that on the headline accuracy metrics data leakage could\\nprovide approximately an 7–8% over estimate in a models\\npredictive accuracy. This experiment was performed by gener-\\nating the SMOTE examples prior to running the 10 fold-CV and\\ncalculating the equivalent metrics to those reported later in the\\nmanuscript.

For each molecule,\\nwe generate over 1500 descriptors using Mordred.78 The list of\\nMordred descriptors can be found at ref. 94. From these\\ndescriptors, we are only interested in those that have a notable\\ncorrelation with absorption capacity. We thus set a Spearman\\ncorrelation cutoﬀof 0.5 and further analysed these features for\\nsigni\\ue103cance using a two-tailed p-test95 over 5000 random sample\\npermutations using the Spearman correlation coeﬃcient as the\\ntest statistic, leaving 35 features which have a signi\\ue103cant p-value\\nat 95%. The list of features which correlate are given in the ESI.†\\nFollowing feature generation, we apply one-hot encoding for\\ncategorical features and min–max scaling for continuous\\nfeatures. There were 6 features considered as categorical out of\\nthe 35 (nBondsM, nBondsKD, C1SP2, HybRatio, FCSP3, ETA_-\\nbeta_ns). Categorical in this case includes features with speci\\ue103c\\nincrements such as counts. Following one hot encoding the\\nfeature set extends to 84 as every unique value of the categorical\\nfeatures becomes a binary feature array.

There is\\na slight improvement in the speci\\ue103city also over the three\\nmodels compared to the models using Mordred or MACCS\\nrepresentations. Overall the MCC scores are now all over 0.5\\nshowing the more balanced predictive accuracy.\\nComparing the models on their summary metrics we see that\\nin general Fig. 8–10 and Tables 1–3 suggest that classi\\ue103cation of\\nmolecules using shallow learning algorithms for absorption\\ncapacity is a diﬃcult task. Across the models presented we have\\nused several molecular representations. The Mordred descrip-\\ntors are composed of a range of well known 2D molecular\\ndescriptors encoding information of electronic state, graph\\ntopologies\\nand\\nmolecular\\nproperties.\\nWe\\nfound\\n35 had\\na notable correlation with absorption capacity but this vector\\nextended to 84 when one-hot encoding was applied.

The current models struggle particularly to\\ncorrectly separate molecules into the promising class, with\\na fairly balanced error rate across false positives and false\\nnegatives predictions.\\nThe MACCS \\ue103ngerprints are a standard \\ue103ngerprint repre-\\nsentation which has been employed many times in materials\\nmodelling. To our knowledge, it has not been applied previously\\nto predicting absorption capacity. In this work we see that the\\nMACCS \\ue103ngerprint performs reasonably as a representation but\\nstruggles with the classi\\ue103cation of molecules in the promising\\nclass. This is clearly shown in the sensitivity and speci\\ue103city\\nvalues. The MACCS \\ue103ngerprints are the largest representation\\nused in this work at 164 elements each, with every element\\nrequiring a sub-structure match to build the representation.\\nThis can be a relatively computationally expensive task.\\nHaving considered these two standard representation methods,\\nwe developed our own \\ue103ngerprint, inspired by the MACCS scheme,\\nwhich encoded the sub-structures noted by the carbon capture\\ncommunity to correlate with carbon capture performance.

The\\nLogistic Regression models across all feature sets have tended to\\nprovide the most promising predictive accuracy over the classes.\\nAll models show a reasonable capability to predict the molecules\\nwhich are unlikely to be promising in terms of capacity, which for\\nHTVS may still be a useful and computationally inexpensive \\ue103lter.\\nThe use of the CCS \\ue103ngerprint provides improved predictions of\\nthe positive class suggesting it could be useful in HTVS in terms of\\nprioritisation of laboratory testing.\\n3.3\\nFeature importance\\nWe have performed feature importance analysis using the\\nLogistic Regression classi\\ue103ers over the diﬀerence feature sets.\\nThe importance of a feature is re\\ue104ected by the magnitude of the\\nlinear regression coeﬃcients in the models. We show in Fig. 11\\nthe mean feature importance over the 10 cross validation.\\nWhilst being careful not to over interpret Fig. 11, as they are\\nbased on no underlying fundamental physics or chemical\\ntheory, we can see some trends in the feature which are\\nimportant. Looking at sub-Fig. 11A, using Mordred descriptors\\nwe note number of auto-correlation feature have large magni-\\ntude coeﬃcients. These auto-correlation coeﬃcients relate to\\nvalence electrons and charges suggesting the model is largely\\nrelying on fairly simplistic representations of the electronic\\nstructure of the molecule. These models may be improved with\\na better description of the electronic structure.\\nFor the MACCS keys feature importance in Fig. 11B we also\\nsee the nitrogen environment as being important. For example\\nbit numbers 70, 80 and 84 all relating to the presence or sepa-\\nration between nitrogen atoms in a molecule. The largest\\npositive Logistic Regression coeﬃcient belongs to bit 109 which\\nrepresents the presence and absence of a CH2–O which could\\nmatch to an alcohol functionality.\\nFig. 11C displays Logistic Regression coeﬃcients of large\\nmagnitudes for the CCS \\ue103ngerprint on features related to the\\nnitrogen environment, separating distances between amine and\\nalcohol groups and chain lengths together with whether\\na molecule contains multiple amine functionalities. These are\\nstructural features which have been highlight by others as\\ncorrelating with absorption capacity.\\nWe provide in the ESI† a SHAP99 analysis of each of these\\nmodels over 10 cross validation for the 20 most important\\nfeatures as determine by SHAP. This analysis was performed on\\na subset of the each folds test data. This analysis shows similar\\ntrends to the feature importance.\\n4\\nConclusions\\nThis work proposes a new molecular representation, CCS\\n\\ue103ngerprint and data set ccs-98, both of which are available at\\nhttps://github.com/Jammyzx1/Carbon-capture-\\ue103ngerprint-\\ngeneration. An analysis of the chemical space of amines and N-\\nheterocyclic molecules is provided against a background of\\ncommercially available amines and N-heterocyclic molecules.\\nThis analysis shows that carbon capture solvent molecules\\ninhabit a sub-space, but are not outliers in their structure\\ncompared to the wide set of commercially available amines and\\nN-heterocyclic molecules. This is promising as it suggests that\\nthere may be other commercially available molecules suitable\\nfor carbon capture without expensive new synthesis pathways\\nbeing required. It also highlights chemical functional groups\\nwhich in the ccs-lit-167 data set diﬀer in relative abundance\\ncompared to commercial amines and N-heterocyclic molecules\\nin the zinc-20938 data set. It remains unclear whether these\\ndiﬀerences are due to a lack of reporting on carbon capture\\ncapabilities for molecules containing these functionalities or\\ndue to these chemical functionalities having a consistent\\ndetrimental impact on carbon capture performance. This is an\\narea for further exploration which could have a notable impact\\non the \\ue103eld by improving knowledge, data availability and thus\\nmodelling validation capabilities.\\nWe used this chemical space analysis to de\\ue103ne a novel\\n\\ue103ngerprint for the modelling of amine molecules used in\\ncarbon capture. This \\ue103ngerprint has been shown to be an\\neﬀective featurization method for QSAR modelling and a way to\\nanalyze the chemical space. We have also tested the use of\\ncommonly applied featurization methods through the Mordred\\nengine and MACCS \\ue103ngerprints. The QSAR models built in this\\nwork show that QSAR prediction for absorption capacity is\\nchallenging with the limited available data. Some of our model\\nshow promise for high throughput virtual screening of carbon\\ncapture amines in the future. The use of the CCS \\ue103ngerprint\\ngave the most accurate classi\\ue103cation models for each class. The\\nCCS \\ue103ngerprint also showed the most balanced model in terms\\nof predictive accuracy for each class.\\nOne of the biggest challenges to this work is relative lack of\\nopen available data in this \\ue103eld. This leads to small-data issues\\nand limits the potential use of more complex modelling.\\nOpening data in machine readable formats (such as csv, json,\\nparaquat and HDF5 \\ue103les for example) will enable computa-\\ntional scientist to better explore this area. A community\\nconversation on data standards is encouraged to enable fair\\ncomparisons across data sources and models. As policy shi\\ue09ds\\ntowards a net zero carbon world and carbon capture, usage and\\nstorage is deployed, the release of more data in the open liter-\\nature related to these technologies will become more vital.

In this paper, several \\nmonoamines with excellent performance in biogas upgrading process were selected to study the effectiveness of \\ntheir blends for biogas upgrading and compared with 30 wt% monoethanolamine (MEA). The biogas upgrading \\neffect, carbon dioxide (CO2) loading, regeneration effect and CO2 desorption heat of mixed amines were \\ndetermined by batch experiments. 13C NMR was used to mechanistically interpret and quantify the carbocation \\ntrend of the amine solution before and after the reaction and regeneration. The results showed that the biogas \\nupgrading and regeneration effect of the mixed amines combined with methyl monoethanolamine (MMEA) and \\nN-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) was the best, and its initial methane purity, saturated CO2 loading, regener\\xad\\nation rate and CO2 desorption heat after upgrading were 100%, 0.617 mol CO2/mol amine, 54.3% and 64.91 kJ/ \\nmol CO2, respectively. Except for the saturated loading which was second only to MMEA/dimethyl mono\\xad\\nethanolamine (DMMEA) with 0.624 mol CO2/mol amine, all the performances are optimal and the CO2 \\ndesorption heat is 19.01% lower than that of 30 wt% MEA, which can effectively reduce the regeneration energy \\nconsumption of the reaction. The results of 13C NMR showed that the increase of bicarbonate content could \\neffectively reduce the regeneration energy consumption and enhance the initial regeneration rate, and the in\\xad\\ncrease of carbamate could accelerate the initial uptake rate and methane purity, which could provide theoretical \\nsupport for the subsequent screening of mixed amines to achieve different reaction purposes.'"

In this paper, several\\nmonoethanolamine (MEA) derivatives with alkyl groups as\\nvariables are screened as sorbents for the biogas upgrading process.\\nThe eﬀect of alkyl groups on the eﬃciency of biogas upgrading, the\\neﬀectiveness of sorbent regeneration, and the selectivity of CO2/\\nCH4 during biogas upgrading are investigated. The analysis of\\nbiogas upgrading experiments with diﬀerent MEA derivatives\\nshows that methyl and butyl are more favorable for improving CO2\\nabsorption and meeting the biogas upgrading eﬀect of methane purity for a long period of time applicable in some countries, and\\nethyl is more conducive to the regeneration eﬃciency of amines. The results of the CO2 desorption heat calculations show that the\\nCO2 desorption heat of ethyl monoethanolamine (EMEA) (66.67 kJ/mol CO2), formed by replacing a hydrogen near the nitrogen\\nwith an ethyl group, is signiﬁcantly lower than those of methyl monoethanolamine (MMEA) (73.04 kJ/mol CO2) and butyl\\nmonoethanolamine (BMEA) (73.27 kJ/mol CO2), formed by replacing a hydrogen near the nitrogen with a methyl group and a\\nbutyl group, respectively. The CO2 desorption heats were signiﬁcantly lower than those of MEA (82.12 kJ/mol CO2), suggesting\\nthat ethyl can signiﬁcantly reduce the CO2 desorption heat of the amine compared to other alkyl groups. In the CO2/CH4 selectivity\\nexperiments, BMEA showed the fastest initial CO2 absorption rate of 0.83%/s, while dimethyl monoethanolamine (DMMEA)\\nshowed the lowest initial CO2 absorption rate of 0.16%/s.

In this study, the efficiency of carbon \\ndioxide (CO2) trapping in aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA), diglycolamine (DGA), diethanolamine (DEA), and \\ntriethanolamine (TEA) solution during biogas upgrading for biomethane was determined. Effects of hydroxyethyl \\ngroups on MEA derivatives were investigated in terms of biogas upgrading and regeneration, CO2 desorption \\nheat, initial CO2 absorption rate and CO2/CH4 selectivity. The duration of upgraded biogas meeting certain \\nEuropean Union (EU) application standards for methane purity during upgrading was reduced by 70, 78 and 200 \\nmins for DGA, DEA and TEA respectively compared to MEA due to the partial substitution of H-bonds by \\nhydroxyethyl groups, and the absorption rate was also reduced, whereas TEA was not suitable for biogas \\nupgrading as it was inefficient for biogas upgrading effect and absorption rate. The calculated results from the \\nGibbs-Helmholtz equation showed that MEA had the largest CO2 desorption heat (82.47 kJ/mol CO2) and the \\nother MEA derivatives had lower desorption heat than MEA, indicating that MEA consumes more energy in the \\ndesorption process. As for the equilibrium partial pressure, all amine solutions absorbed less than 0.4% of the \\ntotal volume of CH4 and had a high CO2/CH4 selectivity.'"

However, the price of DMSO is too high, which leads to the high cost of reagents. It is worthwhile to \\nchoose a cheap solvent instead of DMSO, which can also achieve satisfactory absorption and desorption per\\xad\\nformance. Around this goal, we selected diethylene glycol diethyl ether (DEGDEE) to form a non-aqueous \\nabsorbent with EHA and investigated the absorption and desorption performance. The desorption efficiency of \\n70 wt% EHA +30 wt% DEGDEE was 99 % at 373 K. The desorption efficiency was 89.4 %, and the desorption \\nenergy consumption was only 45.1 % of MEA when the water content was 10 wt%. DEGDEE can achieve similar \\nor even better performance than DMSO, while the cost of DEGDEE (12000–31000 RMB/ton, technical grade \\npurity 99 %) is lower than DMSO (40000–48000 RMB/ton, technical grade purity 99 %). In addition, it also has a \\ngood recycling capacity. These advantages will certainly endow this newly developed absorbent with great \\napplication prospects in the field of CO2 capture.'"

At a desorption \\ntemperature of 373 K, the CO2-loaded EHA-DMSO exhibited a desorption efficiency of approximately 98 %. The \\nestimation of desorption energy (Et) consumption, using the method of electric energy consumption, revealed \\nthat EHA-DMSO achieved approximately a 50 % reduction in Et compared to the MEA (30 wt%) absorbent. Even \\nwith a water content of 10 %, Et was reduced by around 40 %. Additionally, the absorbent demonstrated notable \\nadvantages in terms of water resistance and cycle performance.

These CDs were treated by amino groups using the \\nhydrothermal method. The structural properties of nanoparticles (NPs) were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, SEM, \\nand zeta potential analyses and the NPs were quasi-spherical with regular micropores. The efficiency of CO2 \\nabsorption from a gas mixture of CO2/N2 was considered as a percentage of the difference in CO2 absorption \\ncapacities between nanofluid and diethanolamine (DEA, 10 wt%) solution compared to the CO2 absorption \\ncapacity of DEA. The experimental results showed that the efficiency of CO2 absorption for CDCH:N-200-8, \\nCDCH:N-180-12, CDCH:N-200-12 and CDCH:N-180-8 nanofluids was equal to 73.86, 53.87, 49.25 and 22.88 \\n%, respectively, which had increased CO2 absorption significantly compared to the DEA base fluid. Among the \\nsynthesized samples, CDCH:N-200-8 nanofluid was a unique candidate for CO2 capture from the atmosphere due \\nto its high absorption efficiency since these particles had advantages such as ease of use, no corrosion, no \\ndeposition in the process, chemical inertness and high thermal stability.'"

It\\nis concluded that stripper and absorber account for the maximum exergy destructions of 8.15 and 7.55 MW, respectively; this shows\\nsigniﬁcant potential for operation improvement in these two key equipment. Also, it is concluded that 5.47 and 4.92 MW\\nunavoidable exergy destructions occur in the stripper and absorber, respectively, which cannot be prevented. It is found from the\\nadvanced exergy analysis that the absorber, stripper, and heat exchanger with the greatest recoverable exergy amount (e.g., exergy\\nrehabilitation ratio) exhibit substantial operation enhancement capability in comparison to the other process equipment. The overall\\nexergy eﬃciency of the entire system is enhanced from 99.70 to 99.90%, when the technological constraints are abolished and the\\nideal condition governs.

        "Title": "'Theoretical Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Reactivity in\\nMethylpiperidines: A Conformational Investigation\\n'",
        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: In this work, the possible mechanisms for the reactions of CO2\\nwith various positional isomers of methylpiperidines (MPs) (N-MP, 2-MP, 3-\\nMP, and 4-MP) including the effect of aqueous solvation have been explored\\nusing quantum chemical methods. The major pathways investigated for CO2\\ncapture in aqueous amines are carbamate formation, its hydrolysis, and the\\nbicarbonate formation (CO2 + H2O + MP) reaction. The calculations indicate\\nthat an axial orientation for the methyl group and an equatorial for the COO−\\ngroup could be energetically ideal in the carbamate product of MPs. The proton\\nabstraction step in the carbamate pathway is almost barrierless for the zwitterion-\\namine route, while a much higher energy barrier is observed for the zwitterion-\\nH2O route. During carbamate hydrolysis, the addition of even two explicit water\\nmolecules does not exhibit any notable effect on the already high energy barrier\\nassociated with this reaction. This indicates that bicarbonate formation is less\\nlikely to occur via carbamate hydrolysis. The calculations suggest that, although\\nthe carbamate pathway is kinetically favored, the MP carbamate could still be a minor product, especially for sterically hindered\\nconformations, and the bicarbonate pathway should be predominant in aqueous MPs.\\nreaction involves H-abstraction from the zwitterion, which is\\nalmost barrierless. Yamada et al.17 studied the interaction of CO2\\nwith moderately hindered amines (such as 2-isopropylaminoe-\\nthanol) using quantum chemical methods. They predicted that\\ncarbamate formation is a kinetically fast reaction while\\nbicarbonate is the major product for moderately hindered\\namines. Stowe et al.18 studied the thermodynamic and kinetic\\nfactors associated with the CO2 absorption mechanism in\\naqueous AMP,19 a sterically hindered primary amine. The\\nauthors observed that AMP’s protonation occurs more favorably\\nthan carbamate formation in aqueous solutions as AMP is a\\nstronger base. The authors emphasized on the significance of\\nkinetic factors while considering CO2−aqueous amine reactions.\\nYamada20 explored the effect of the dielectric constant of the\\nsolvent in aqueous amines and amine-functionalized ionic liquid\\nanions using quantum mechanical calculations. From the study,\\nit was observed that the conventional reaction between CO2 and\\namines in a solvated environment largely depends on the\\ndielectric constant of the solvent while amine-functionalized\\nanions easily form stable C−N bonds irrespective of the\\ndielectric constant of the solvent. Said et al.21 have proposed a\\ngeneral pathway for the CO2−amine reaction mechanism\\n(aqueous/non-aqueous) based on previous theoretical and\\nexperimental works. The authors have concluded that\\nbicarbonate formation begins as the amine concentration\\ndecreases (with the CO2 pressure maintained), and the\\ncarbamate, which is initially formed, decomposes back to an\\namine. In the presence of tertiary amines and sterically hindered\\namines, H2O becomes a stronger nucleophile attacking the\\nelectrophilic CO2, and thus, the bicarbonate pathway is\\nfollowed.\\nIn general, cyclic amines have been found to be more\\nadvantageous over other alkanolamines (such as MEA and\\nDEA) for CO2 absorption as these have high CO2 absorption\\ncapacities and fast absorption rates (first-order reaction) and\\nrequire lower regeneration energy.22−27 Piperidine, a hetero-\\ncyclic secondary amine, is one such example that has been\\nstudied as a suitable CO2 absorbent.28−31 Piperidine has\\nenhanced solubility in water as compared to other cyclic amines\\nsuch as piperazine. In addition, piperidine has been found to\\nhave high CO2 absorption rates with a pKa of 11.22 and\\nwithstand oxidative and thermal degradation.22,32 Among\\nnumerous studies discussed above, a detailed thermodynamic\\nand mechanistic approach for each pathway (Scheme 1) of the\\nmethylpiperidine (MP)−CO2 interaction has not been\\naccomplished so far. Thus, in this work, we have performed a\\nfull conformational analysis of the positional isomers of MPs,\\nnamely, N-methyl (N-MP), 2-methyl (2-MP), 3-methyl (3-\\nMP), and 4-methyl (4-MP), reactions of their conjugate acids\\n(protonated amines), non-bonded complexes, transitions states\\n(TSs), and carbamate products formed during the course of\\ncarbon capture reactions. Using conventional thermodynamic\\ncycles, the solution-phase free energy (ΔGaq) of each of the\\nreaction pathways has been estimated together with the\\ncomputation of aqueous phase equilibrium constants, Keq.\\nMP-CO2 binding energies (BEs) have been calculated\\n(corrected with a basis set superposition error (BSSE)) to\\nestimate the extent of non-bonding interactions in MPs. The\\nactivation energy (Ea) barriers for each pathway have been\\ndetermined in the solution phase to predict the predominant\\nroute followed by the MPs for CO2 capture. The computational\\ndetails are presented in the following section, and the variation\\nof ΔGaq and Ea of MP conformers for each reaction pathway is\\ndiscussed in the Results and Discussion. The major outcomes of\\nthis work are summarized in the concluding remarks.\\n2. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\\nA Gaussian 09-Rev.D0133 software package was used for all the\\nquantum chemical calculations. Geometry optimization for each\\nconformer of all the species including free amines and\\nprotonated amines and their carbamates was performed using\\ntwo different functionals: B3LYP34 and M06-2X.35 An empirical\\nGrimme’s dispersion correction36,37 was employed for all the\\ncalculations performed using both the functionals. The 6-311+\\n+G(d,p) basis set was used for all calculations. The solvent-\\nphase optimizations (with water as the implicit solvent) using\\nthe SMD38 solvation model (solvation model based on density),\\nwhich utilizes the IEF-PCM39 (integral-equation formalism\\npolarizable continuum model) approach, were performed to\\nestimate the free energy of solvation (ΔGsol) of various reaction\\nspecies. Vibrational frequencies were also calculated at the same\\nlevel ensuring the structures to be a stationary point (reactants,\\nnon-bonded complexes, and products) or a TS (with one\\nimaginary frequency). Relaxed potential energy surface (PES)\\nscans of the reacting species for each pathway with the relevant\\nreaction sites (as the scan coordinate) were performed to obtain\\nthe starting geometries. The TS structures were validated using\\nQST240 with guess reactant−product pairs. The transition states\\nwere further confirmed by an IRC41,42 (intrinsic reaction\\ncoordinate) method. We have included both the Ea (activation\\nenergy) and Δ⧺G° (free energy of activation) values to compare\\nthe results with other works.21\\nScheme 1.

In Figure 1, the gas-phase stability order is\\nprovided for better clarity of the functional group orientation. In\\nthe aqueous phase, except for N-MP, the stability order of MP\\nconformers (including pip conformers) is observed to be\\nprecisely reversed for the cis-ax:trans-eq and trans-ax:cis-eq pair.\\nHence, the aqueous phase stability order will only be considered\\nwhile discussing the carbon capture reactions in subsequent\\nsections.\\nThe geometrical parameters of eq-pip calculated with B3LYP\\nand M06-2X functionals are compared with the experimental\\nresults in Table S1. Although comparable, the geometries\\noptimized with the B3LYP functional show slightly better\\nagreement with the experimental values than M06-2X.

Nevertheless,\\napart from the free-energy parameters for carbamate hydrolysis\\nreaction (ΔGg, ΔΔGsol, and ΔGaq), the B3LYP and M06-2X\\nresults follow similar trends. For most of the reactions (Scheme\\n1), results from B3LYP are closer to the previously calculated\\nvalues in the literature.14,15 Thus, we primarily focus on the\\nresults obtained from B3LYP. The inclusion of the dispersion\\ncorrection has a notable effect on the thermochemical data (the\\nreference ΔGaq values14,15 in Table 2 for eq-pip do not include\\ndispersion effects).54 Other than ΔGaq, the inclusion of\\ndispersion effects also has a remarkable impact on the ΔGg\\ncorresponding to carbamate hydrolysis as shown in Table S5.\\nThe discussion regarding aqueous equilibrium constants\\n(Keq) corresponding to reactions 1, 2, and 3 (Scheme 1) and the\\ngas-phase BSSE-corrected interaction energies (ΔEint) of the\\nvarious MP conformers is provided in Tables S14 and S15,\\nrespectively. The Keq results for MP conformers indicate their\\nadequate performance as carbon capture solvents whereby the\\nequilibrium shifts mostly toward the product side.

The solution-phase reaction energies (ΔGaq)\\nfor the carbamate formation reactions of the various conformers\\nof MPs are listed in Table 3. The ΔGaq trends using B3LYP and\\nM06-2X functionals are similar, however, with a significant\\ndifference in their magnitudes, especially in the case of cis-ax and\\ntrans-eq conformers of 2-MP. Both conformers do not favor the\\nCO2 attack due to steric hindrance from the methyl group in\\nproximity. The cis-eq 2-MP and trans-ax 2-MP (with a methyl\\ngroup at the axial position) have a lower ΔGaq and are predicted\\nto be the conformers for carbamate formation. This observation\\nis also supported by Tremaine and co-workers,27,49 who\\nemployed experimental and theoretical NMR and IR techniques\\nto confirm the existence and stability of 2-MP carbamate in an\\naqueous solution. The authors concluded that the major\\nconformer of 2-MP carbamate has a methyl group at the axial\\nposition. In the case of 3-MP and 4-MP conformers, cis-eq and\\ntrans-eq 3-MP and cis-eq 4-MP indicate a stronger preference for\\ncarbamate formation. Overall, ΔGaq data suggest that 3-MP and\\n4-MP have a slightly higher carbamate formation tendency than\\nunsubstituted piperidine.\\n3.1.2. Carbamate Hydrolysis. The solution-phase reaction\\nenergies for carbamate hydrolysis aid in understanding the\\nrelative stability of the various MP carbamate conformers. Table\\n4 shows the ΔGaq values for the carbamate hydrolysis reaction.\\nThe results from the B3LYP functional suggest that the\\ncarbamates of cis-ax and trans-eq conformers of 2-MP show\\nfacile hydrolysis as compared to other 2-MP conformers (these\\nconformers showed the least tendency toward carbamate\\nformation as well (Table 2)). The ΔGaq values from the M06-\\n2X functional differ significantly from B3LYP for this reaction\\n(as discussed in the previous section in Table 1). For MPs, the\\nΔGaq values from the M06-2X functional are endoergic as\\nopposed to exoergic values from B3LYP. da Silva and\\nSvendsen14 and Jackson et al.15 reported exoergic ΔGaq values\\nfor this reaction in the case of eq-pip using the B3LYP functional.\\nHowever, the difference in the magnitude of ΔGaq values\\nbetween conformers are found to be similar in many cases\\nregardless of their absolute values (such as between cis-ax and\\ncis-eq and trans-ax and trans-eq conformers) as shown in Table 4\\nwhere the ΔGaq values for carbamate hydrolysis of MPs are\\ncompared using B3LYP, M06-2X, and ωB97XD functionals.\\nTable 2.

The ΔGaq values in Table 5\\nshow that most of the MPs follow the bicarbonate pathway with\\ngreater spontaneity. Even the sterically hindered cis-ax and trans-\\neq 2-MP favor the bicarbonate pathway. The ΔGaq values\\ncalculated using the B3LYP functional are comparatively more\\nexoergic than the M06-2X functional. N-MP, being a tertiary\\namine, can capture CO2 only via the bicarbonate pathway as\\nthere is no proton on the N atom to initiate carbamate\\nformation. Overall, the ΔGaq values provide a comparative\\nanalysis of the conformational preference toward major carbon\\ncapture pathways during the aqueous MP−CO2 interaction.\\nThe dominant pathway leading to carbon capture in each MP\\nand its conformers cannot be predicted solely via ΔGaq data. For\\nthis, further study of the reaction pathway and energy barrier for\\neach step needs to be investigated. Accordingly, we first\\ninvestigate the carbamate pathway. The non-bonded complexes,\\nreactant complexes, transition states, and products involved in\\neach pathway are designated as NB, RNB, TS, and P,\\nrespectively, and numbered according to the order of their\\nappearance in the discussion.\\n3.2. Mechanism of the Carbamate Pathway. Several\\nexperimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that the\\ncarbamate reaction pathway in amines proceeds via two steps\\nwhere the zwitterion formation is the rate-determining\\nstep.16,50−53 Table S17 shows the optimized geometries of the\\nspecies involved in the carbamate pathway for pip and MP\\nconformers: (MP + CO2) non-bonded reactant complex\\n(RNB1), TS1, and zwitterion (P1). In the first step (Table\\nS17), RNB1 reacts to form a zwitterion (P1) for which the\\nactivation energy barriers were found to be quite low (<1 kcal/\\nmol), while Δ⧺G° values were slightly higher (∼1−3 kcal/mol).\\nAmong pip conformers in general, the COO−group, being\\nbulkier, tends to occupy the equatorial position. The highest\\nenergy barrier for the carbamate formation reaction was found\\nfor trans-eq 2-MP. Moreover, axial methyl groups tend to\\nfavor27,49 the CO2 approach in 2-MP as evident from the low Ea\\nand Δ⧺G° values associated with such conformers (especially for\\ntrans-ax 2-MP), resulting into a carbamate having an axial methyl\\nand equatorially oriented COO−group (Table S17). It can be\\nconcluded that most of the 3-MP and 4-MP conformers favor\\nthe carbamate pathway with an axial methyl and equatorial\\nCOO−group (for the incoming CO2) as the most preferred\\norientation with low energy barriers.\\nIt is noteworthy that the TS1 and P1 were found to be stable\\nonly in the aqueous phase, while these species were not found to\\nbe at a saddle point and local minimum, respectively, in the gas\\nphase. This peculiar behavior of TS1 and P1 zwitterionic species\\nhas also been observed in some previous studies.16,55 Addition-\\nally, it has been demonstrated that the solvent (e.g., water) aids\\nin lowering the activation energy for amine−CO2 interactions by\\nassisting the C−N bond formation.21 This reinstates the\\nimportance of including solvent effects while modeling such\\ninteractions. From Table S17, it is observed that the C−N bond\\ndistance in TS1 of all piperidines varies from 2.26 to 2.58 Å,\\nwhich decreases to 1.57−1.62 Å as P1 forms, while the O−C−O\\nbond angle decreases to 133.4−134.6° in P1 (from 158.8 to\\n169.8° in TS1). The low Ea of the CO2 + MP reaction suggests\\nthat this step is kinetically favored being thus a fast reaction. The\\nenergy profile of MPs obtained for zwitterion formation during\\nthe carbamate pathway is shown in Figure 2a (Ea = 0.75 kcal/\\nmol), and the corresponding IRC curve thus obtained is given in\\nFigure S4. Among various MP conformers, cis-ax 4-MP and\\ntrans-eq 4-MP are illustrated here, being the most stable\\nconformers of 4-MP in the aqueous and gas phases.\\nFor the gas phase (NB2 →RNB2 →TS2 →P2), a TS (TS2)\\nfor the proton transfer step is identified, which ultimately follows\\nthe carbamic acid pathway as indicated in the energy profile\\ndiagram (Figure 2b). However, this pathway proceeds with a\\nhigher energy barrier (12.43 kcal/mol). During this reaction, the\\nMP−CO2 interaction is assisted by a second MP molecule\\n(Brønsted base), which is shown as RNB2 in Figure 2b. The TS2\\nleads to an intermediate (methylpiperidinium carbamate),\\nwhich further forms the carbamic acid product (P2) via an\\nintermolecular proton transfer.\\nThe second step in the aqueous carbamate pathway involves\\nan intermolecular proton transfer via another piperidine\\nTable 4.

A PES scan corresponding to this step\\nwas performed in the aqueous phase with the H−N distance (H\\natom on the zwitterion and N atom of the second pip molecule)\\nas the reaction coordinate. The TS could not be located for this\\nstep in the solvent phase, which indicates that proton transfer\\ncould be a barrierless process that is independent of the\\nconformer, similar to some earlier known cases.16,50 Interest-\\ningly, a TS (TS3) for the proton transfer step could be obtained\\nonly for ax-pip, which is illustrated in Figure 3a (corresponding\\nIRC provided in Figure S4). The relative energy profile shows\\nthat the Ea for TS3 is 0.67 kcal/mol, which reinstates that the\\nzwitterion···pip interaction during carbamate formation is\\nfavorable.\\nXie et al.16 have previously demonstrated that the proton\\ntransfer step during carbamate formation in MEA is an acid−\\nbase reaction owing to the activation of the N−H bond through\\nzwitterion formation. This results in the fast kinetics for this step,\\nespecially in an aqueous solution where proton transfer is even\\nfaster. The shortening of the C−N bond distance from RNB3\\n(1.55 Å) to P3 (1.42 Å) also indicates the preference for this\\npathway. We also investigated the catalytic effect of water on the\\nzwitterion for the proton transfer step during carbamate\\nformation. Figure 3b shows the role of water for the proton\\nabstraction from the zwitterion (ax-pip) where the reactant\\ncomplex, TS, and products are indicated as RNB4, TS4, and P4,\\nrespectively. The energy barrier for this reaction is calculated to\\nbe quite high (20.10 kcal/mol) as compared to the zwitterion-\\npip proton abstraction pathway (almost barrierless). This agrees\\nwith the previous studies,16,21,50 which reported that amines act\\nas better Brønsted bases than water during the proton transfer\\nprocess. The calculations also reveal that the carbamic acid\\nproduct formed during water-aided proton transfer is energeti-\\ncally less favored compared to the zwitterion intermediate.\\n3.3. Mechanism of the Carbamate Hydrolysis. Many\\nprevious studies on amine-based CO2 capture have established\\nthat the bicarbonate generated during the process originates\\nfrom the hydrolysis of the ammonium carbamate.4−8,14,15\\nHowever, more recent studies have demonstrated that\\ncarbamate hydrolysis is not the major contributor of bicarbonate\\nspecies during amine−CO2 interactions due to the high energy\\nbarrier associated with this reaction.6,17,21,51 Furthermore, it has\\nalso been experimentally verified for few acyclic amines that\\nbicarbonate formation starts only after the depletion of the\\ncarbamate in the reaction medium as protonated amines\\ndiscourage bicarbonate formation.21 Thus, in order to verify\\nthese findings, we have also investigated the hydrolysis of the\\nMP carbamates and their various conformers.\\nTable S18 shows the species involved in the carbamate\\nhydrolysis reaction, namely, the (MP carbamate + H2O)\\nreactant complex, TS, and (bicarbonate + amine) product\\ncomplex. This reaction has been considered to be a concerted\\nbut asynchronous reaction as it proceeds with the concurrent\\nFigure 2.

The amine (4-MP) acts as a base and\\nprotonates to generate a OH−ion (fast reaction) followed by the\\nnucleophilic attack of the OH−ion on the CO2 carbon. The\\ncorresponding relative energy profile is shown in Figure 4a for\\ntrans-eq 4-MP. The characteristic IRC curve (Figure S4) shows\\nan initial small hump indicating the proton (from water) and N\\natom interaction followed by a steep curve for the nucleophilic\\nattack of OH−on CO2 (Ea = 34.41 kcal/mol). Table S18 shows\\nthat the barrier for carbamate hydrolysis of MPs is quite high (Ea\\n≈33−37 and Δ⧺G° ≈34−38 kcal/mol) and thus seems\\nimplausible. Even after including two water molecules, the\\nhydrolysis reaction indicates a high energy barrier (Ea ≈33 kcal/\\nmol) as shown in Figure 4b. It is important to note that\\nsignificant conformational changes are involved during product\\nformation for both the carbamate reaction and its hydrolysis\\n(Figures 2−4 and Tables S17 and S18). Thus, it is essential to\\nexplore the mechanistic parameters for each conformer of the\\nMPs for the carbon capture reactions, rather than just\\nconsidering the most stable conformer of each MP.\\n3.4. Mechanism of the Bicarbonate Pathway. The\\nbicarbonate pathway involves the reaction of H2O and CO2\\ncatalyzed by amine (pip) to form piperidinium bicarbonate. The\\noptimized structures of the reactant complex, CO2 + H2O + MP\\n(RNB7), TS (TS7) and product complex, and bicarbonate +\\nprotonated MP (P7) of all the MP conformers for this reaction\\nin the aqueous phase are provided in Table S19. It is a single-step\\nconcerted reaction characterized by the abstraction of the\\nproton from water by amine (pip/MP) followed by the\\nnucleophilic attack of OH−on CO2. The computed Ea and\\nΔ⧺G° values for piperidine and MP vary between 7.00 and 10.00\\nkcal/mol. The energy profile of the bicarbonate pathway for\\ntrans-eq 4-MP (Ea = 8.79 kcal/mol) is shown in Figure 5, and the\\nrelevant IRC curve (Figure S4) also corresponds to the desired\\nset of reactant and products. Most of the hindered 2-MP\\nconformers participate in the bicarbonate pathway, which is in\\ncontrast with their carbamate formation tendency. It can be\\nproposed that the bicarbonate reaction pathway suits most of\\nthe MP conformers regardless of their structural geometry.\\nThus, it could be a predominant pathway for carbon capture in\\nMPs along with the carbamate pathway, which is kinetically fast\\nand suitable for unhindered primary and secondary amines.\\nTable 6 shows a comparative analysis of the energetic barriers\\nand reaction free energies associated with CO2 capture reactions\\nin various acyclic and cyclic amines. It would be reasonable to\\ncompare the results from the present work with the previously\\nobtained data at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level. Accordingly,\\nthe Δ⧺G° of the carbamate (zwitterion) formation reaction in\\ncase of MPs is quite comparable with acyclic amines such as\\nMEA, methylamine, and EDA. All the results indicate a\\nkinetically favored carbamate formation reaction. From Table\\n6, it is seen that similar calculations using CCSD(T) and MP2\\nlevels of theory show significant variation in the results. The\\nresults of Δ⧺G° of the bicarbonate formation reaction show a\\nhigh positive value for MEA and AMP, which could be\\ncompared with MPs even though the computation levels differ.\\nAnother interesting parameter is ΔΔG*, which is a straightfor-\\nward indication of carbamate stability.17 Accordingly, the\\ncarbamate formation tendency among acyclic and cyclic amines\\nlisted in the table should follow the order of MPs (B3LYP) >\\nMEA > AMP > 2-PE (COSMO-RS//BP/TZVP), which\\nreinstates the fast kinetics of the carbamate formation reaction\\nin MPs. The ΔGg and ΔGaq values of MPs for carbamate\\nhydrolysis reactions have already been discussed in the above\\nsections, and these are quite comparable with other cyclic\\namines as observed in Table 6. Overall, the trends of activation\\nenergy barriers and reaction free energies of MPs computed at\\nB3LYP-D3/SMD/6-311++G(d,p) agree reasonably well with\\nthe previously computed values (at different levels and solvation\\nmodels) for various cyclic and acyclic amines. Thus, aqueous\\nMPs should be explored further as potential post-combustion\\nCO2 capture solvents for large-scale industrial applications at par\\nwith other popular amine solvents, such as MEA.\\n4. CONCLUSIONS\\nThis work explores various conformers of MPs for aqueous CO2\\ncapture reactions with the aid of appropriate thermodynamic\\nmodels and the calculation of energy barriers for each capture\\npathway. Thermodynamic calculations pertaining to ΔGaq and\\naqueous Keq reveal that the energetically stable conformers of 3-\\nMP and 4-MP show a facile carbamate formation tendency.\\nFigure 4.

The activation free energies for the\\ncarbamate pathway (zwitterion formation) are quite lower (1−3\\nkcal/mol) than the values obtained excluding dispersion\\ncorrections. During the proton transfer step in the carbamate\\npathway, the zwitterion−amine route shows a much lower\\nenergy barrier than the zwitterion−H2O route. For the\\ncarbamate hydrolysis reaction, even two explicit water molecules\\ndo not exhibit any significant effect on the high energy barrier.\\nEnergetically stable hindered trans-eq 2-MP shows the least\\ntendency toward carbamate reactions, while cis-eq 2-MP tends\\nto follow the carbamate pathway with greater ease. Additionally,\\ntrans-ax 2-MP also shows preference for the carbamate pathway\\nand this is in accordance with the previous experimental works\\nbased on IR and NMR data of the resulting carbamate.27,49\\nMoreover, some of the other conformers of MPs such as the cis-\\nax 3-MP and trans-ax 4-MP also show low barrier heights for\\ncarbamate formation, which indicates that the axial methyl and\\nequatorial COO−group could be an energetically viable and\\nideal orientation of the functional groups in the carbamate\\nproduct of MPs.

        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: Clathrate hydrates are host−guest crystalline\\ncompounds which can capture both small gases such as H2,\\nCH4, and CO2 and larger guest molecules which are in the liquid\\nstate. Large guests (LGs) such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) can\\nstrongly stabilize the structure II clathrate hydrate under moderate\\nconditions and provide a substantial number of small cages for the\\nencapsulation of smaller guest gases. Most hydrocarbon LGs are\\nvolatile and immiscible in water, and even the water-miscible LGs\\nsuch as THF are still volatile. The use of these LGs requires a\\nrecovery process in applications based on hydrates. Amines are one\\nchemical group of alternative LGs which have low vapor pressure\\ncompared to hydrocarbon LGs. In this study, we report structural\\ncharacterization for clathrate hydrates formed with the cyclic amine pyrrolidine (PL) and the structurally related THF. Crystal\\nsamples were formed from aqueous solutions of PL and THF with several ratios. Lattice constants determined by the single-crystal\\nX-ray diﬀraction increased with the increase of PL content in the hydrate. Inspection of the cage size found that 51264 cages expand\\ndue to PL inclusion, while the empty 512 cages do not expand to the same degree. The reﬁned X-ray diﬀraction structure suggests\\nthat the PL is incorporated in the large cage without forming hydrogen bonds with the cage water molecules. Molecular dynamics\\nsimulations also support weak hydrogen bond interactions between PL and water molecules.'"

No\\nexperimental data of any kind are required for the solvents, and no empirical\\nadjustments are required for its implementation. This hybrid methodology\\ncalculates reaction equilibrium constants by combining high-level quantum\\nchemical calculations of ideal-gas standard reaction Gibbs energies (ΔG0) with\\nconventional solvation free energy calculations obtained from classical force\\nﬁeld methodology. For these quantities we use explicit solvent molecular\\ndynamics simulations with the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF). The\\nresulting equilibrium constants are then coupled with a macroscopic Henry\\nLaw based ideal solution model to calculate the solution speciation and the\\nCO2 partial pressure, PCO2. We show results for seven primary amines:\\nmonoethanolamine (MEA), 2-amino-2-methylpropanol (AMP), 1-amino-2-\\npropanol (1-AP), 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (AMPD), 2-aminopropane-1,3-diol (SAPD), 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol or\\ndiglycolamine (2-AEE or DGA, respectively), and 2-amino-1-propanol (2-AP). Experimental speciation and PCO2 data for some of\\nthese are available, with which we validate our methodology. We predict new results for others in cases when such data are\\nunavailable, and provide explanations for the experimental inability to detect carbamate solution species in relevant cases. Our results\\nfor the pK value of the carbamate reversion reaction are within the chemical accuracy limit of 218.546/T units (corresponding to 1\\nkcal·mol−1 in the corresponding free energy change) in comparison with experimental results when such data exist, which at 298.15\\nK corresponds to 0.73 pK units. The precision of our pK predictions is comparable to that which can be obtained from conventional\\nexperimental methodologies for these quantities.

This work applied the knowledge\\nof air dispersion modelling to map out the atmospheric dispersion and resulting ground surface level\\nconcentration of gaseous amine, namely Monoethanolamine (MEA), from a coal-ﬁred power plant\\n(with a carbon capture unit) and in surrounding areas, in case of an accidental leaking of amine from\\nthe CCS system to the atmosphere. The chosen study area was centered on a coal-ﬁred power plant in\\nthe province of Saskatchewan, Canada. The Environmental Protection (EPA) approved air pollution\\nmodel (CALPUFF), together with meteorological and geophysical data were used for gaseous amine\\ndispersion simulation. The results were presented, and the ground amine concentrations were found\\nto vary with wind patterns (wind direction and wind speed). The maximum ground surface amine\\nconcentrations standard is 15.2 µg/m3. However, the results showed that when using the water\\nwash unit, the MEA concentrations were well below the standard level, compared to those without\\nthe water wash unit. It is essential for CO2 capture plants located in highly populated areas to be\\nequipped with water wash units.\\nKeywords: carbon capture; dispersion model; air pollution; amine emissions; coal-ﬁred power plant'"

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\n3.1. Carbamate and Carbonic Acid Formation.\\nAccording to Davis and Rochelle, the major products of\\nthermal degradation of MEA, as identiﬁed by chromatography,\\nin descending order are HEIA, AHEIA, HEEDA, and OZD.9\\nOZD is generally considered as an intermediate species, both\\nbecause it is observed in small quantities and mechanistic\\npathways can be envisaged where it can react to form the other\\nproduct species mentioned above.9\\nA thorough investigation into the initial formation of\\ncarbamate, carbamic acid, and bicarbonate species is not\\nnecessary here, having already received a great deal of literature\\nattention.19,34−38 The exact nature of the CO2 absorption step\\nis still under debate, with the existence of an intermediate\\nzwitterion species still a controversial topic. lida and co-\\nworkers39 and Arstad et al.40 each found a stable zwitterion in\\nan aqueous solution. More recently, Xie et al. performed more\\naccurate calculations using CCSD(T) and found a reaction\\nmechanism where the formation of a zwitterion is the rate\\ndetermining step.41\\nHere, our ﬁrst consideration was the formation of carbamate\\nand carbamic acid for comparison with existing literature data.\\nThe nitrogen atom of MEA can act as a nucleophile and react\\nwith dissolved CO2 in the solution to form a carbamate. The\\ngenerated carbamate can subsequently undergo a hydrogen\\ntransfer reaction either intramolecularly (though a 1,3 H-\\ntransfer reaction) or facilitated through transfer to, and from, a\\nfurther molecule of MEA or H2O to form carbamic acid.\\nMoreover, the carbamate could exist as an ion pair with a\\nprotonated MEA molecule. The energy proﬁles for these\\nprocesses are summarized in Figure 3.\\nBoth product species, the carbamate or the ion pair, are\\nformed via a H-transfer reaction to either the carboxylate\\noxygen or nitrogen atom of a neighboring MEA molecule,\\nrespectively. Given that nitrogen atoms are more basic than\\noxygen atoms, it is of no surprise that the formation of an ion\\npair has both a lower activation energy (0.4 cf. 22.9 kcal mol−1)\\nand a more favorable reaction enthalpy compared to carbamic\\nacid formation (−27.2 cf. −8.9 kcal mol−1). However, the\\nformation of carbamic acid could become signiﬁcant at higher\\nCO2 loadings where the concentration of MEA-CO2 would far\\nexceed that of free MEA and thus favor formation of carbamic\\nacid.\\n3.2. OZD Formation from Carbamates, Carbamic\\nAcid, and Isocyanates. Next, the cyclization of the product\\nspecies to form OZD was investigated. Given that the\\nformation of an ion pair is more favorable than carbamic\\nacid, this was used as a starting point for further optimization.\\nThe energy proﬁle for formation of OZD is shown in Figure 4.\\nIn the transition state, the carboxylate oxygen attacks the\\ncarbon atom, α, to the hydroxyl group, thus forming a ﬁve-\\nmembered ring. Concurrently, the hydroxide leaving group\\nabstracts a proton from the nearby ammonium cation\\nultimately forming OZD, water, and regenerating MEA. The\\nactivation energy for this reaction is 39.5 kcal mol−1, and the\\nFigure 3.

Eng. Chem. Res. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX\\nC\\noverall reaction is endoergic by 6.3 kcal mol−1. Whilst the\\nactivation energy is appreciably high, it is still permissible\\nunder standard experimental conditions generally observed in\\nthe stripper.\\nAnother possible route to formation of OZD is via\\ncyclization of isocyanates, as shown in Scheme 1. Such species\\nhave been reported to form from the dehydration of carbamic\\nacids.42,43\\nTwo distinct transition states leading to the dehydration of\\ncarbamic acid were located. The ﬁrst involved intramolecular\\ndehydration whereby the N−H hydrogen reacts with the\\nhydroxyl motif of the carboxylic acid group to liberate water\\nand isocyanate. The second involved two concurrent hydrogen\\ntransfer reactions facilitated by an explicit water molecule in\\nthe calculation (shown in Figure 5). The intramolecular\\nreaction had an activation energy of 47.0 compared with 34.8\\nkcal mol−1 for the water-facilitated reaction. Given that the\\nreaction medium has signiﬁcant quantities of water, this route\\nwill be preferred. The overall reaction is endoergic with a\\nreaction energy of +4.5 kcal mol−1. The generated isocyanate\\ncan then go on to react further. Two potential species that\\nmight form and thus investigated here are cyclization leading\\nto the formation of OZD and reaction with a further molecule\\nof MEA to form BHEU.3\\nThe formation of BHEU, a related compound to UREA, is\\npresented in Scheme 2, and the energy proﬁle is shown in\\nFigure 6. In the transition state, the nitrogen atom on MEA\\nacts as a nucleophile and reacts with the electrophilic carbon\\natom of the isocyanate molecule. At the same time, a hydrogen\\natom is transferred from the −NH2 group to the nitrogen atom\\non the isocyanate group. This reaction has an activation energy\\nof 28.7 kcal mol−1 and a reaction energy of −23.6 kcal mol−1.\\nGiven the large excess of MEA present in the stripper and the\\nrelatively low reaction barrier, it is likely that any isocyanate\\nthat does form does not accumulate and can rapidly react\\nfurther to form BHEU.\\nThe second reaction of isocyanate investigated was\\ncyclization to form OZD. Transition states could not be\\nlocated for cyclization from either protonated or neutral\\nisocyanate. Scan calculations suggested that there was no\\nbarrier to either reaction. However, a transition state for the\\nreaction was found to be facilitated by the addition of both a\\nprotonated and a neutral MEA molecule. The energy proﬁle is\\nshown in Figure 7. In the transition state, the neutral MEA acts\\nas a base and accepts a proton from the hydroxyl group of the\\nisocyanate. The oxygen then reacts with the carbonyl carbon,\\nand the forming ring accepts a proton from the protonated\\nMEA molecule. The activation energy is 2.9 kcal mol−1, which\\nis very low and suggests a facile reaction. The reaction energy\\nis −35.3 kcal mol−1. Similar values were reported by Yoon et\\nal.15\\n3.3. HEEDA Formation. High performance liquid\\nchromatography (HPLC) investigations undertaken independ-\\nently by Davis and Lepaumier identiﬁed that HEEDA is\\nformed prior to the formation of HEIA or AHEIA but is\\nobserved after the formation of OZD.9,44 Hence, the formation\\nof HEEDA was investigated next. It is believed to form via a\\nring opening reaction between OZD and MEA in accordance\\nwith Scheme 3.45\\nIn this reaction, the nitrogen atom on the MEA molecule\\nacts as a nucleophile and attacks OZD. This causes the ring to\\nopen by breaking the C−O bond. Subsequent hydrogen\\ntransfer can occur either facilitated through transfer to and\\nfrom a molecule of either water or MEA or intramolecularly\\nthrough a 1,4 H-transfer. This is accompanied by loss of CO2,\\nwhich ultimately generates HEEDA. The energy proﬁle is\\nshown in Figure 8.\\nThe activation energy for the initial attack of MEA on OZD\\nis 27.2 kcal mol−1. This forms an intermediate zwitterion\\nspecies, which can undergo an internal hydrogen transfer\\nreaction to form a species that can more readily release the\\nbound CO2 molecule. This reaction is predicted to have a very\\nScheme 1. OZD Formation via Dehydration of Carbamic Acid and Subsequent Cyclization of the Product\\nFigure 5.

Eng. Chem. Res. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX\\nD\\nlow activation energy of 1.3 kcal mol−1 and is typical for\\nintramolecular reactions, which are generally faster than\\nintermolecular reactions. Overall, the reaction to form\\nHEEDA from OZD and MEA is very slightly endoergic with\\na predicted reaction energy of 0.2 kcal mol−1. Given the\\nstandard operating conditions for these reactions, the\\nformation is still more than feasible.\\n3.4. HEIA and AHEIA Formation. Data accrued from\\nboth NMR studies and HPLC analysis has shown that HEIA is\\nthe most observed product species arising from thermal\\ndegradation of MEA.9 One route to its formation is through\\nthe reaction of HEEDA and CO2, as shown in Scheme 4.\\nFigure 9 shows the energy proﬁle for HEIA formation. There\\nare two nitrogen atoms on the HEEDA molecule either of\\nwhich could react with CO2 to form the initial carbamate\\nspecies. It was found that reaction at the terminal nitrogen\\natom was less favorable, most likely due to the lower basicity of\\nthe primary compared to the secondary nitrogen atom. The\\ncarbamate species can then undergo a 1,3 H-transfer reaction\\ntransferring a hydrogen from the nitrogen to the carboxylate\\noxygen to form carbamic acid. This was also observed in the\\nreaction of MEA and CO2.\\nThe carbamic acid species formed as a result of this\\nhydrogen transfer is marginally less stable than the separated\\nreactants (+2.7 kcal mol−1). However, it can undergo a\\ncyclization reaction that is concurrent with the elimination of\\nwater to form HEIA. The transition state for this reaction is\\nshown in Figure 10. The terminal nitrogen atom acts as a\\nnucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom on the\\ncarboxylic acid group.\\nThe overall reaction energy for the formation of HEIA is\\n−6.7 kcal mol−1. This is consistent with experimental\\nobservations that suggest that this species is observed in\\nhigher concentrations compared to other products.\\nFigure 7. DFT-calculated ΔH energy proﬁle for the proposed formation of OZD from isocyanate, facilitated by MEA and protonated MEA.\\nScheme 3. HEEDA Formation from OZD and MEA\\nFigure 8.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX\\nE\\nAHEIA is formed in a related reaction to that for HEIA, as\\nshown in Scheme 5. The energy proﬁle is shown in Figure 11.\\nEither the terminal nitrogen or the secondary nitrogen atom\\ncan act as a nucleophile and attack an electrophilic carbon\\natom on a molecule of OZD. This causes the OZD ring to\\nopen with an activation energy of 26.6 kcal mol−1. Subsequent\\nhydrogen transfer (activation energy 33.7 kcal mol−1) and\\ncyclization (activation energy 30.7 kcal mol−1) lead to the\\nformation of AHEIA.\\nThe overall reaction energy is −10.9 kcal mol−1. This is\\ncomparable to the calculated value for the formation of HEIA.\\nIt is likely that AHEIA is observed in smaller amounts due to\\nthe low concentrations of OZD, which is necessary for its\\nformation. In contrast, AHEAI needs only a further molecule\\nof MEA, which is in great excess. This is consistent with\\nexperimental observations where more AHEIA is formed than\\nHEIA.\\n3.5. Oxidative Degradation of MEA. 3.5.1. MEA\\nRadical, Peroxide, and Imine formation. Oxidative degrada-\\ntion is generally considered to occur in the presence of oxygen\\nfrom ﬂue gas.46,47 Furthermore, trace metal ions such as Fe2+,\\nCr3+, Ni2+, and Mn2+ are also believed to play an important\\nrole. However, whilst the exact mechanism of oxidative\\ndegradation still remains unclear, it is considered to be\\ninitiated by electron and/or hydrogen abstraction from the\\namine.12,48 These radicals could originate from metals, from\\ndissolved oxygen, or via the presence of alkyl radicals.49,50 The\\nreported products from oxidative degeneration are vast. They\\ninclude but are not limited to ammonia, formaldehyde,\\nethanol, glyoxal, oxalic acid, methylamine, formamide, glycol,\\nglycine, acetone, and imidazolidine.\\nFigure 12 shows the DFT-calculated energy proﬁle for\\nabstraction of hydrogen radicals from four positions on MEA.\\nTo reduce the computational cost of the calculations, an ethyl\\nradical was chosen as a model for R•. The activation energies\\nfor the abstractions ranged from 8.2 to 10.8 kcal mol−1. The\\nmost stable product resulted from abstraction of a hydrogen\\nradical from the carbon α to the amino group. However,\\nabstraction at either carbon or the nitrogen results in an\\nexoergic reaction leading to stable products.\\nThe radical species formed here is often reported to react\\nwith oxygen and through subsequent proton abstraction and\\nelimination forms an imine and hydrogen peroxide as shown in\\nScheme 6. The DFT-calculated energy proﬁle is shown in\\nFigure 13.\\nThe initial binding of oxygen to the MEA-radical species\\nunsurprisingly is favorable. The following step where the\\nperoxy radical species, H2NCH(OO•)CH2OH, picks up a\\nhydrogen radical, most likely from water or another molecule\\nof MEA, is also highly favored. This forms a peroxide species,\\nH2NCH(OOH)CH2OH. Despite multiple attempts, a tran-\\nsition state whereby HOOH is eliminated from this species in\\nisolation could not be located. To address this, an explicit\\nwater molecule was included in the calculations, which acted to\\nfacilitate the elimination reaction. Given the large excess of\\nwater in the experimental system, this is a reasonable approach.\\nThe transition state is shown in Figure 14.\\nIn the transition state, a hydrogen atom is transferred from\\nthe water molecule to the −OOH group forming hydrogen\\nperoxide. Concurrently, a hydrogen is transferred from the\\nnitrogen on the MEA radical to the −OH group, which acts to\\nreform the water molecule. The activation energy for this\\nFigure 9.

The former was investigated next.\\nThe precollision complex, transition state, and product\\ncomplex were all reoptimized with an additional explicit water\\nmolecule to investigate whether this made this chemical\\npathway more feasible. A comparison of the energy proﬁles for\\nreactions containing one and two water molecules is shown in\\nFigure 15. This additional water molecule acts to lower the\\nactivation energy from 48.4 to 28.7 kcal mol−1. The product\\ncomplex was also further stabilized with two water molecules\\nas opposed to one. It is clear to see that additional water\\nmolecules increase the kinetic and thermodynamic viability of\\nimine formation from the peroxide species.\\n3.5.2. Reaction between MEA and Organic Acids. A\\nnumber of studies have shown that amide species can form in\\npilot plants from oxidative degradation.3,44,47,51,52 These\\nspecies can be formed from the reaction of MEA and organic\\nacids, as shown in Scheme 7.\\nThe energy proﬁle for the formation of HEF from the\\ncondensation reaction of MEA and formic acid is shown in\\nFigure 16. This reaction is initiated by nucleophilic attack of\\nthe nitrogen atom of MEA on the carbonyl carbon of formic\\nacid. Several H-transfer reactions aﬀord the product complex\\nand water. This is a favorable process with a reaction energy of\\n−7.92 kcal mol−1 and an activation energy of 40.1 kcal mol−1.\\nThe activation energies for the remaining species from Scheme\\n7 are 36.9, 40.2, and 39.3 kcal mol−1 for formation of HEA,\\nHHEA, and BHEOX, respectively.\\nOur ﬁnal consideration was the formation of 4-(2-\\nhydroxyethyl)piperazinone (HEPO). This has been observed\\nto form in pilot plants as a mixture of two isomers, one major\\nand one minor\\ue0d5dependent on the positioning of the carbonyl\\ngroup. It has been theorized to form via a ring closing reaction\\nfrom N-(2-hydroxyethyl)−2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)acetamide\\n(HEHEAA), as shown in Scheme 8. Either of the internal\\nnitrogen atoms can act as a nucleophile and react with a carbon\\nﬁve bonds away to yield the product. The resulting energy\\nproﬁle is shown in Figure 17.\\nThe stabilities of the major and minor products are very\\nsimilar. In contrast, the transition state leading to the major\\nproduct species is 17 kcal mol−1 lower in energy than that\\nleading to the minor species. The relatively high activation\\nenergies is consistent with experimental observations that\\nsuggest that prolonged exposure to high temperatures is\\nneeded to observe the formation of HEPO.3\\n3.6. Schematic Reaction Network. The above computa-\\ntional investigations have presented possible chemical path-\\nways leading to the formation of likely degradation products of\\nMEA. Table 1 summarizes these reactions along with\\nactivation parameters, reaction energies, and Arrhenius factors.\\nThese reactions can provide the basis for the construction of a\\nfull chemical kinetic mechanism that can predict and control\\nthe rate of thermal degradation in experimental plants. This\\nwill form the basis of a future publication.\\n4. CONCLUSIONS\\nIn this work, we have reported on the DFT calculations of\\nvarious important reactions involved in both the thermal and\\noxidative degradation of monoethanolamine. Activation and\\nreaction energies were calculated and evaluated to rationalize\\nwhich chemical pathways are most favored.\\nFigure 14.

However, the\\nformation of carbamic acid may become important at higher\\nloadings of CO2, which would reduce the available MEA in the\\nsystem. Carbamic acid can dehydrate to form isocyanate,\\nwhich subsequently can react with MEA to form BHEU, a\\nrelated compound to UREA. Furthermore, isocyanate can\\ncyclize to form OZD.\\nOZD reacts favorably to form HEEDA via a ring opening\\nreaction with MEA. HEEDA can cyclize to form HEIA or react\\nwith MEA to form AHEIA.

        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: A thorough understanding of the origin of all\\nproducts arising from the degradation of amines used in carbon\\ncapture is crucial for the development of new and improved\\nsystems. Here, we present density functional theory (DFT) studies\\ninvestigating the routes to thermal and oxidative degradation\\nproducts of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP). The formation\\nof dimethyloxazolidinone (DMOZD) via the cyclization of\\ncarbamates, carbamic acids, and/or isocyanates is more favored\\nfor AMP than for monoethanolamine (MEA). In contrast, the\\nformation of amides from the reaction of organic acids and AMP is\\nunlikely due to large free activation energies. 2,4-Lutidine is\\npredicted to form via the reaction of ammonia, propanone, and\\nethanal. Ammonia and low-molecular-weight organic acids are\\npredicted to form favorably from AMP radical fragmentation. The network of elementary reactions investigated here can form the\\nbasis of a larger chemical kinetic model, which could be instrumental in predicting product formation in novel systems.\\nAMP acts as a nucleophile and abstracts a proton from water.\\nConcurrently, the liberated hydroxide attacks the carbon atom\\nin CO2 to form bicarbonate. The free-energy proﬁle for this\\nreaction is shown in Figure 6. As can be seen, the reaction has\\nlow free activation energy and is overall exergonic, suggesting\\nthat bicarbonate could form easily via this route. The only\\nlimitation to this reaction is the three reactants coming together\\nin the correct orientation for a reaction to occur.\\nIn contrast, Figure 7 shows that the formation of bicarbonate\\nvia water attacking an anion complex is prohibited by a very large\\nfree activation energy. This is consistent with other literature\\nstudies that also predict a large barrier for this conversion.\\n3.1.2. Protonation Products. We recently reported on the\\ndegradation reactions of piperazine during carbon capture.\\nProtonation of the amine group was found to be a critical step in\\nthe formation of many degradation products.47 Similar\\nprotonation of the amine group in AMP might facilitate\\nreactions with other amines and/or water, as shown in Scheme\\n4. This leads to the formation of TM-DEA or a diol, respectively.\\nThe free-energy proﬁle for the formation of a diol from the\\nreaction of AMPH+ and water is shown in Figure 8. As can be\\nseen, the reaction has a relatively high free activation energy and\\nScheme 6. Proposed Formation of TM-HEEDA from AMP and DMOZD\\nFigure 12.

Similar results were recently reported for\\nMEA.38 While the formation of the diol is not strictly prohibited,\\nits formation is unlikely. Any diol formed would be susceptible\\nto nucleophilic substitution; this reaction would have low free\\nactivation energy and be strongly exergonic.\\nFigure 13.

Eng. Chem. Res. 2021, 60, 18337−18360\\n18345\\nIn contrast, the reaction of AMP and AMPH+ is much more\\nlikely. The free-energy proﬁle in Figure 9 shows that the reaction\\nhas similar free activation energy compared to the hydrolysis\\nreaction in Figure 8. However, the reaction is only marginally\\nendergonic (1.6 kcal mol−1) and could easily be surmounted\\ngiven standard experimental conditions experienced in carbon\\ncapture systems.\\n3.1.3. Formation of Dimethyloxazolidinone (DMOZD).\\nOxazolidinone (OZD) is an important intermediate in MEA\\ndegradation and is a precursor to the formation of N-(2-\\nhydroxethyl)ethylenediamine (HEEDA), N-(2-aminoethyl)-\\nN′-(2-hydroxyethyl)imidazolidin-2-one (HEIA), and N-(2-\\naminoethyl)-N′-(2-hydroxyethyl)imidazolidin-2-one\\n(AHEIA).45,48 Degradation of AMP can form a substituted\\nanalogue of OZD, 4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazolidinone (DMOZD).\\nTwo routes to its formation are shown in Scheme 5. Isocyanate\\ncan cyclize to form the target complex, facilitated by AMP and\\nAMPH+, which are necessary to carry out the transfer of\\nhydrogens. Alternatively, an ion pair species can lead to the\\nformation of DMOZD and AMP.\\nFigure 10 presents the DFT-calculated free-energy proﬁle for\\nthe formation of DMOZD from an ion pair. In the transition\\nstate, a ﬁve-membered ring is formed when the carboxylate\\noxygen attacks the carbon atom α to the hydroxyl group. The\\ncationic AMPH+ provides a hydrogen, which reacts with the\\nhydroxide leaving group and forms water. Overall, this reaction\\nforms DMOZD, water, and AMP. The activation free energy is\\n34.9 kcal mol−1, which is lower than the recently reported value\\nfor OZD formation in MEA degradation (39.3 kcal mol−1) and is\\nconsistent with a more nucleophilic amine.38\\nScheme 9.

Here, hydroxyl oxygen acts as a\\nnucleophile and attacks the carbon of the isocyanate group.\\nAMP acts as a nucleophile and deprotonates the hydroxyl group,\\nand the protonated AMP provides a proton for the isocyanate\\ngroup. The free activation energy for this reaction is 18.7 kcal\\nmol−1, and the reaction is overall exergonic. This suggests that\\nany isocyanate present could easily convert into DMOZD. This\\nreaction would be much more favored than the formation of\\nBHEU presented earlier, which has a much larger free activation\\nenergy.\\n3.1.4. Formation of 2-[(2-Amino-2-methylpropyl)amino]-\\n2-methyl-1-propanol (TM-HEEDA), 1-(1,1-dimethyl-2-Hy-\\ndroxyethyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (TM-HEIA), and\\nHM-AHEIA. HEEDA is formed in MEA degradation after the\\nformation of OZD but before the formation of HEIA or AHEIA.\\nFigure 18. DFT-calculated free-energy proﬁle for the proposed formation of an imine.\\nScheme 12. Formation of Nitrosamines and Nitramines from AMP\\nFigure 19. DFT-calculated free-energy proﬁle for the formation of a nitrosamine from AMP and N2O3.\\nIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research\\npubs.acs.org/IECR\\nArticle\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c03963\\nInd. Eng. Chem. Res. 2021, 60, 18337−18360\\n18348\\nWith a similar structure, it is likely that AMP degradation follows\\na similar path so this was investigated next. A methyl-substituted\\nvariant, TM-HEEDA, can form from the reaction of AMP and\\nDMOZD according to Scheme 6. The free-energy proﬁle is\\nshown in Figure 12. Initially, nucleophilic attack of the AMP\\nnitrogen atom on the CH2 linker of DMOZD causes the ring to\\nopen and results in a zwitterionic species. This has an activation\\nfree energy of 40.5 kcal mol−1. Hydrogen transfer from the\\nprotonated amine to the terminal amine facilitates the loss of\\nCO2 from the terminal amine and generates the target molecule\\nTM-HEEDA.\\nOnce successfully formed, TM-HEEDA can react with CO2 to\\nform TM-HEIA (a substituted version of HEIA) according to\\nScheme 7. There are two amine groups present in TM-HEEDA,\\neither of which can bind with CO2. As shown in Figure 13, our\\ncalculations show that there is little preference as to which site\\nCO2 binds (the energies diﬀer by 0.2 kcal mol−1). The\\nzwitterionic species in each case can undergo a 1,3-H-transfer\\nreaction to form a carbamic acid. The activation free energies are\\n44.2 and 45.5 kcal mol−1 when compared to the separated\\nreactants. This energy can likely be lowered with the inclusion of\\nexplicit water molecules as demonstrated previously. Either of\\nthe carbamic acids can cyclize with the elimination of water to\\nform TM-HEIA, which is calculated to be 3.9 kcal mol−1 more\\nstable than the separated reactants.\\nA further reaction that TM-HEEDA can undergo is with\\nDMOZD. This forms HM-AHEIA according to Scheme 8.\\nInitially, the terminal amine on TM-HEEDA acts as a\\nnucleophile and attacks the CH2 linker on the ring of\\nDMOZD. This causes the ring to open and forms a zwitterion\\ncomplex. Figure 14 shows this step to have an activation free\\nenergy of 41.4 kcal mol−1. To form HM-AHEIA, CO2 needs to\\nbind to one of the internal nitrogen atoms. Once appropriately\\nbound, the carbonate can undergo a 1,3-hydrogen transfer\\nreaction (or an intermolecular reaction where water facilitates\\nthe transfer) to form a carbamic acid. Lastly, a ring formation\\nreaction can occur, which eliminates water and forms the target\\ncomplex. While the reaction is exoergic overall, the relatively\\nhigh barriers and number of required steps would suggest that\\nHM-AHEIA forms slowly and in low quantity.\\nFigure 20. DFT-calculated free-energy proﬁle for the formation of a nitramine from AMP and N2O4.\\nTable 1. Activation Free Energies for the Formation of Nitrosamines and Nitramines from the Reaction of N2O3 and N2O4 with\\nVarious Primary and Secondary Amines\\nIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research\\npubs.acs.org/IECR\\nArticle\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c03963\\nInd. Eng. Chem. Res. 2021, 60, 18337−18360\\n18349\\n3.1.5. Formation of Epoxides. The formation of epoxides\\nduring MEA degradation has been suggested by Lepaumier.49 If\\nthey do form, it could potentially open up new routes to\\nproducts that would otherwise be diﬃcult to rationalize. Two\\npotential routes to the formation of epoxides from AMP are\\nshown in Scheme 9. Prior protonation of amine nitrogen can\\ncreate a better leaving group (NH3 compared to NH2\\n−) and\\ncould facilitate the nucleophilic substitution reaction to form an\\nepoxide. Alternatively, an epoxide could form from a zwitterion\\nform of AMP.\\nBoth of these potential routes were investigated and free-\\nenergy proﬁles are shown in Figure 15. The formation of an\\nepoxide from protonated AMP is unlikely. The activation energy\\nis high, and the reaction is overall highly endergonic. On the\\nother hand, formation from a zwitterion is possible given\\nstandard experimental conditions. It has a low free activation\\nenergy (12.6 kcal mol−1), and the reaction is exergonic overall. It\\nis noted, however, that the zwitterion must ﬁrst form from AMP\\nif this reaction is to proceed, which would carry its own energy\\npenalty.\\nEpoxides are susceptible to nucleophilic attack due to the\\nstrained nature of the three-membered ring. This ring strain can\\nbe relieved by attack at a carbon α to the oxygen atom. The most\\nabundant nucleophile present in the reaction mixture is likely to\\nbe AMP, which is investigated here as a model reaction. Scheme\\n10 details the reaction to form 2-[(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl)-\\namino]-2-methyl-1-propanol (DAMP).\\nFigure 16 shows the free-energy proﬁle for the reaction. The\\nfree activation energy for the nucleophilic attack is 31.2 kcal\\nmol−1. The free reaction energy is also exergonic (−9.6 kcal\\nmol−1). Both of these observations suggest a facile reaction,\\nconsistent with relieving the strain of the three-membered ring\\nin the epoxide.\\nScheme 13.

Eng. Chem. Res. 2021, 60, 18337−18360\\n18350\\n3.1.6. 2-Methyl-2-(methyleneamino)-1-propanol (DM-\\nMAE) and Imine Formation. The formation of 2-methyl-2-\\n(methyleneamino)-1-propanol (DM-MAE) is analogous to the\\nformation of MAE, which is observed in MEA degradation. It is\\nformed from a condensation reaction of AMP and form-\\naldehyde. The formation of the latter is presented in Section\\n3.2.2. The reaction is summarized in Scheme 11.\\nThe free-energy proﬁle for this reaction is shown in Figure 17.\\nInitially, AMP acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl\\ncarbon of formaldehyde, leading to a zwitterion (AMP···CH2O\\nbound in Figure 17). This species can undergo two subsequent\\nhydrogen transfer reactions to eliminate water and form DM-\\nMAE.\\nA related reaction can be envisaged where formaldehyde and\\nammonia can react to form an imine. Comparison of Figures 17\\nand 18 reveals a similar free-energy proﬁle. The nitrogen atom\\non ammonia initially attacks the carbonyl carbon of form-\\naldehyde. Successive proton transfers yield the target imine.\\nWhile the free activation energy of the hydrogen transfer step\\ncan be lowered by the addition of an explicit water molecule, it is\\nstill appreciably high. This would suggest that the reaction is not\\noverall signiﬁcant during AMP degradation.\\n3.1.7. Nitrosamine and Nitramine Formation. The\\nformation of nitrosamines and nitramines during amine-based\\ncarbon capture represents a major environmental concern.50−52\\nThey are carcinogenic and there are legal limits as to the\\nquantity, which can be vented into the atmosphere. They are\\nformed when nitrogen oxides (NOx) species react with amines,\\naccording to Scheme 12.\\nDespite multiple attempts, transition states were not located\\nfor the reaction of AMP with either NO or NO2 radicals. Scan\\ncalculations along the reaction coordinate showed no\\ndiscernable saddle point in either case (Figure S1 in the\\nSupporting Information). Comparison of the energies of the\\nreactants and products suggests that direct reaction of NO and\\nNO2 with amines is unlikely.\\nTransition states were located for the reaction of N2O3 with\\nAMP. As in Figure 19, this reaction can proceed through a\\nconcerted reaction where NO is transferred to the amine\\nnitrogen. Concurrently, a hydrogen is transferred from the\\nFigure 22.

This reaction is\\npredicted to have a relatively low free activation energy (10.6\\nkcal mol−1), and the reaction is exergonic overall. This would\\nsuggest that if any N2O3 were present in the reaction system, it\\nwould easily react with amines to form nitrosamines.\\nA similar reaction to that described in Figure 19 could be\\nenvisaged for N2O4, which could react with amines through a\\nconcerted transition state to form nitramines and HNO2. Figure\\n20 shows the free-energy proﬁle for the reaction of N2O4 and\\nAMP. The activation free energy is 23.8 kcal mol−1, and the\\nreaction is exergonic overall.\\nThe analyses carried out in Figure 19 for nitrosamine\\nformation and Figure 20 for nitramine formation from AMP\\nwas conducted for TM-HEIA, DMOZD, and TM-HEEDA. The\\nresults are tabulated in Table 1. As can be seen, free activation\\nenergies are larger for both nitrosamine and nitramine formation\\nFigure 24.

In contrast, the formation of nitramines from the\\nreaction of N2O4 and amines is less likely due to relatively large\\nactivation energies.\\n3.1.8. TM-HEEDA: An Alternative Route. In Section 3.1.4, we\\npresented a route to the formation of TM-HEEDA via a ring-\\nopening reaction between AMP and DMOZD. This reaction\\nhad a free activation energy of 40.5 kcal mol−1. An alternative\\nroute to the formation of TM-HEEDA is presented here, which\\nis formed through a dimethyl-oxazoline intermediate, as shown\\nin Scheme 13.\\nFigure 21 shows the DFT-calculated free-energy proﬁle for\\nthe formation of an ester from AMP and formic acid. Here, the\\nalcohol group on AMP initially attacks the carbonyl carbon of\\nformic acid. Proton transfer from the cationic oxygen center to\\none of the hydroxyl groups leads to the formation of a\\nprotonated ester and water. This reaction has a free activation\\nenergy of 24.2 kcal mol−1 and a free reaction energy of −22.7\\nkcal mol−1. While viewed in isolation, this reaction should easily\\nproceed; it will be in competition with the formation of an amide\\nwhere formic acid is attacked by nitrogen rather than oxygen.\\nThis reaction is discussed in more detail in Section 3.2.4.\\nOnce formed, the next step toward the formation of TM-\\nHEEDA is the conversion of the ester into dimethyl-oxazoline.\\nAs shown in Figure 22, the nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen\\natom on the carbonyl carbon leads to the formation of a ﬁve-\\nmembered ring. A pair of proton transfers, again likely catalyzed\\nby water, leads to the dimethyl-oxazoline product.\\nThe ﬁnal step is the conversion of dimethyl-oxazoline to TM-\\nHEEDA. This reaction is initiated by a nucleophilic attack of\\nAMP nitrogen on the sp3 carbon of dimethyl-ozaoline. This\\nScheme 16.

As shown in Figure 23, this\\nreaction has a free activation energy of 39.2 kcal mol−1.\\nOverall, while the energy proﬁles presented in Figures 21−23\\ndemonstrate that TM-HEEDA can be formed via an alternative\\nroute to that outlined in Section 3.1.3, a series of\\ninterconversions and a larger number of molecules are required\\nfor this to occur. This route may contribute to some degree to\\nthe TM-HEEDA generated during AMP degradation, but it is\\nunlikely to be the primary route.\\nIrrespective of the method of formation, TM-HEEDA can\\nundergo a reaction with epoxides (formation of epoxides was\\nproposed in Section 3.1.5) to form N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N′-(1,1-\\ndimethyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-1,1-dimethylethylenediamine (TM-\\nBHEEDA).

The oxidative degradation of\\namines is considered to be a radical-driven process that occurs\\nmainly in the absorber, where the oxygen concentration is\\ngenerally higher than in the stripper.53−55 The presence of trace\\nmetal ions such as Cr3+, Fe3+, Ni2+, and Mn3+ are also considered\\nto play a key role in generating radical species. There are a\\nsigniﬁcant number of products, which can result from oxidative\\ndegradation. Here, we investigate what are considered to be the\\nmain pathways and principal products.\\n3.2.1. Reactions with OH, Et, and O2 to Form Radical\\nSpecies. Oxidative degradation is likely to begin with radical\\nabstraction from amine. As shown in Scheme 14, there are four\\nsites on AMP where a hydrogen might be abstracted. Namely,\\nthe NH2 group, the pendant methyl groups, the CH2 linker, and\\nthe hydroxy group. The reaction at each of these sites was ﬁrst\\ninvestigated using a hydroxyl radical (OH•). Figure 25 shows\\nthe activation free-energy proﬁle for each reaction. As can be\\nseen, activation free energies are low in all cases, suggesting the\\nfacile formation of AMP radicals. The lowest value was\\ncalculated for abstraction from the amine with the highest\\nvalue calculated for abstraction at OH. In each case, reaction free\\nenergies are exergonic. Similar results were recently reported for\\nradical abstraction from MEA.38\\nEach of the reactions in Figure 25 was repeated with both O2\\nand Et• in place of OH•. The collated data is shown in Table 2.\\nThe smallest free activation energies are observed for the\\nreactions with OH•, and reactions with O2 are predicted to have\\nthe largest activation energies.\\n3.2.2. Radical Fragmentation. Irrespective of the method\\nthrough which the AMP radical is formed, it can further\\nfragment into smaller species. Scheme 15 shows a potential\\nfragmentation reaction from a radical centered on the amine. A\\nrelated reaction was ﬁrst proposed for MEA by Petryaev et al.56\\nand here could lead to the formation of formaldehyde and\\npropylamine. In this reaction, concurrent bond breaking (O−H\\nand C−C) and bond forming (N−H) occur in a single-step\\nreaction.\\nScheme 18. General Scheme for Condensation Reactions to Form Amides\\nFigure 30.

Eng. Chem. Res. 2021, 60, 18337−18360\\n18356\\nAs can be seen in Figure 26, the reaction is predicted to have a\\nlow free activation energy (15.9 kcal mol−1) and radical\\nrecombination to form iPrNH2 is strongly exergonic and can\\nhelp to drive the reaction.\\nA species with a radical located on the secondary carbon atom\\ncan undergo a fragmentation reaction, as shown in Scheme 16.\\nBreaking of the N−C and O−H bonds leads to the formation of\\nammonia and, initially, a radical that can combine with a\\nhydrogen source to form 2-Me-propanal. Figure 27 shows the\\nfree-energy proﬁle for this reaction. As can be seen, the free\\nactivation energy is very low (5.9 kcal mol−1) and the reaction\\nenergy is strongly exergonic.\\n3.2.3. Formation of 2,2-Dimethylglycine and 2,2-Dime-\\nthylglycolic Acid. The formation of glycine is observed in the\\nexperimental degradation studies of MEA, and mechanistic\\nroutes to its formation have been proposed by Bedell.57,58 Here,\\nwe investigated a related reaction beginning with AMP, which\\ncan lead to a substituted analogue of glycine, as shown in\\nScheme 17.\\nThe peroxide species can be formed via the reaction of the\\nappropriate AMP radical (i.e., a radical centered on carbon α to\\noxygen) with oxygen followed by a radical termination step.\\nOnce formed, with the addition of a source of base (in this case,\\nAMP), an elimination reaction can occur, which generates 2-2-\\ndimethylglycine. Figure 28 shows that the free activation energy\\nfor this step is 24.9 kcal mol−1 and the reaction is strongly\\nexergonic overall.\\nThe conversion of 2,2-dimethylglycine into 2,2-glycolic acid\\noccurs through a mechanism similar to that presented for diol\\nformation in Section 3.1.2. The free-energy proﬁle is shown in\\nFigure 29. Prior protonation of glycine forms a structure that is\\nmore susceptible to nucleophilic attack and is very favorable.\\nThe free activation energy for the hydrolysis reaction is 43.0 kcal\\nmol−1. This is high and thus the formation of glycolic acid is not\\nlikely. Moreover, the reaction is endergonic, which suggests that\\nany product formed would likely convert back to the reactants.\\n3.2.4. Organic Acid Reactions with AMP. A number of\\norganic acids can be formed from radical fragmentation. Any of\\nthese can potentially react with AMP to form amides according\\nto Scheme 18. While it is beyond the scope of this work to carry\\nout an exhaustive inquiry into the reactions that can occur, we\\ninvestigated a few to illustrate what reactions may occur. Figure\\n30 shows the formation of N-(2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylethyl)-\\nformamide (DM-HEF), which results from the reaction of AMP\\nand formic acid.\\nInitially, AMP acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl\\ncarbon of formic acid. Subsequent hydrogen transfer from the\\nnow cationic nitrogen center forms an intermediate species. This\\nreaction has a free activation energy of 45.7 kcal mol−1. A second\\nhydrogen transfer can occur, which acts to eliminate water and\\ngenerate an imine intermediate. The free activation energy for\\nScheme 19. Proposed Mechanistic Steps Leading to the Formation of Lutidine from Ammonia, Propanone, and Ethanal\\nFigure 31. DFT-calculated free-energy proﬁle for the formation of lutidine.\\nIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research\\npubs.acs.org/IECR\\nArticle\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c03963\\nInd. Eng. Chem. Res. 2021, 60, 18337−18360\\n18357\\nthis conversion is prohibitive at 76.7 kcal mol−1. This value,\\nhowever, can be signiﬁcantly reduced with the addition of\\nexplicit water. In this case, the free activation energy is 42.4 kcal\\nmol−1. The ﬁnal step in the formation of an amide is a ﬁnal\\nhydrogen transfer from the hydroxyl group to the imine\\nnitrogen.\\nTable 3 details free activation energies for the formation of the\\nremaining amides as postulated in Scheme 18. As can be seen,\\nthe activation free energies for each reaction are similar\\nindependent of the organic acid. However, given the number\\nof interconversions necessary to reach the products and high free\\nactivation energies, it is unlikely that they form in signiﬁcant\\nquantities. This is supported in experimental studies where they\\nare not observed forming.59\\n3.2.5. 2,4-Lutidine Formation. 2,4-Lutidine is often observed\\nforming in the degradation studies of AMP. The route to its\\nformation, however, is far from trivial. As shown in Scheme 19, a\\nnumber of reactants are needed to rationalize its formation.\\nAmmonia and propanone combine to form an imine (A) and 2\\nequiv of ethanal react through an aldol condensation reaction to\\nform 2-butenone (B). The 2-butenone and imine can then react\\nto form 2,4-lutidine.\\nInitially, the nitrogen on the imine acts as a nucleophile and\\nattacks the terminal carbon of the double bond in 2-butenone\\n(C). This leads to the formation of a zwitterion with a positively\\ncharged nitrogen and negatively charged oxygen. The oxygen\\nlone pair can facilitate the reaction of the double bond with a\\nterminal hydrogen (D). The intermediate formed can react to\\nform a six-membered ring (E). Hydrogen transfer from the\\npositively charged nitrogen to the negatively charged oxygen\\ncreates a species, which can react with a source of base to\\neliminate hydroxide. Finally, the penultimate species can be\\noxidized to form lutidine (F−I). The free-energy proﬁle for this\\nseries of reactions is shown in Figure 31. As can be seen, while\\nthere are a number of interconversions necessary to reach the\\nproduct, free activation energies are surmountable given\\nstandard experimental conditions. Moreover, the reaction free\\nenergy is strongly exergonic overall, which is expected given that\\nan aromatic ring is being formed.\\n4. SCHEMATIC REACTION NETWORK\\nFigure 32 shows a schematic network of all of the elementary\\nreactions investigated here. AMP can react with CO2 to form\\neither an ion pair or carbamic acid. Both of these species can\\ncyclize to form DMOZD, a substituted variant of OZD. TM-\\nHEEDA can be formed either from DMOZD or via a series of\\nreactions beginning with an esteriﬁcation. The formation of\\nTM-HEIA and HM-AHEIA is likely to be slow due to large free\\nactivation energies.\\nRadical abstraction from multiple sites on AMP leads to AMP\\nradicals, which can fragment into smaller organic molecules. The\\nformation of amides from the reaction of organic acids with\\nAMP is prohibited by large free activation energies. This is in\\ncontrast to MEA systems, where amides readily form.\\n5. CONCLUSIONS\\nDFT modeling of the formation of AMP degradation products\\nhas been carried out. Computed activation parameters have\\nbeen compared with experimental observations to rationalize\\nwhich pathways are likely and which are prohibitive. The major\\nproducts expected based upon this work are DMOZD, lutidine,\\nand smaller fragmentation products resulting from oxidative\\ndegradation. In contrast to observations from MEA degradation,\\namides resulting from the reaction of AMP and small organic\\nFigure 32.

        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: Knowledge of the origins of degradation products\\nobserved during amine degradation is crucial to developing new,\\nmore eﬃcient amines for future carbon-capture plants. Here, we\\nreport on a series of density functional theory (DFT) calculations\\nrationalizing the routes to products observed from piperazine\\ndegradation studies. Experimentally viable routes to the formation\\nof 1-(2-aminoethyl)-2-imidazolidone (AEI), N-(2-aminoethyl)-\\npiperazine (AEP), 1-[2-[(2-aminoethyl)amino] ethyl] piperazine\\n(AEAEPZ), N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine (HEP), and 1,1′-(1,2-\\nethandiyl)bis-piperazine (PEP) are presented.

Abstraction of ring hydrogen and subsequent radical\\nrecombination reactions form a hydroperoxide species. Hydro-\\nperoxides can thermally decompose to form two radical species\\n(normally a peroxy and a hydroxy radical). Further radical\\nabstractions can lead to the formation of OPZ.\\nThe energy proﬁle for the reaction of OH and piperazine is\\nshown in Figure 15. The most kinetically viable reaction is\\nabstraction of the NH hydrogen. This reaction has an activation\\nenergy of 1.7 kcal mol−1 compared to 8.2 kcal mol−1 for\\nabstraction of a hydrogen from a CH bond. Given that the N−H\\nbond strength is weaker than C−H, this result is expected and\\nconsistent with other literature studies.42\\nOnce formed, the piperazine radical species can recombine\\nwith oxygen and a further radical source to form a hydroperoxide\\nspecies. Thermal ﬁssion of this species to form two oxygen-\\ncentered radicals requires 34.3 kcal mol−1 and is comparable\\nwith reported values. Figure 16 shows how the generated species\\nwith a radical on the ring oxygen can react with an OH radical to\\nform OPZ. The OH radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the\\nring to generate OPZ and H2O. This reaction is thermodynami-\\ncally very favorable and has a low kinetic barrier (12 kcal mol−1).\\n3.4.2. EDA Fragmentation. A route to the formation of EDA\\nwas presented in Section 3.4.1. EDA can undergo similar radical\\nreactions to those shown for piperazine. Similarly, there are two\\npotential hydrogen abstraction sites on EDA as illustrated in\\nScheme 16, namely, the −CH2 groups and the amine groups. On\\nforming, the radical species can subsequently fragment into\\nsmaller amines and imines.\\nThe DFT-calculated energy proﬁle is shown in Figure 17. As\\nobserved for the reaction of piperazine and OH, abstraction of a\\nhydrogen from the N−H bond on EDA is more favorable than\\nfrom C−H (1.9 cf. 3.8 kcal mol−1). Despite this, both reactions\\nare kinetically and thermodynamically favorable given the\\nexperimental conditions.\\nWe recently reported on the fragmentation reactions that\\nMEA radicals can occur, which were shown to thermally\\ndecompose to form amines, water, and imines. Here, a similar set\\nof reactions can be envisaged for EDA radicals. Scheme 16\\nshows how the radical species might fragment to form ammonia,\\nmethylamine, and two further imine species.\\nThe DFT-calculated energy proﬁles for fragmentation of both\\nradical species are shown in Figure 18. As can be seen, the\\nspecies with the radical located on nitrogen has a lower\\nactivation barrier to fragmentation compared to that located on\\nthe carbon. However, the reaction is endothermic, most likely\\ndue to the instability of the methylamine radical species\\ngenerated. Subsequent more favorable reactions would likely\\nbe needed to drive the reaction forward and prevent rapid\\nrecombination. In contrast, fragmentation of the species with the\\nradical located on the carbon atom is exothermic overall, the\\nreaction being driven by formation of a more stable radical\\nspecies.\\n3.4.3. EDACO2H Fragmentation to Form Formate. Freeman\\net al. observed that when degradation studies were performed\\nusing 13C-labeled CO2, the label was subsequently present in\\nformate and formic acid at the end of the study.14 This\\nobservation would require a mechanism where the formate is\\nsolely produced from the free CO2 and not through degradation\\nof any other species. Scheme 17 shows potential route to the\\nformation of formic acid, starting with a carbamic acid formed\\nfrom EDA. As can be seen in Figure 19, the abstraction of a\\nhydrogen from the central chain is both kinetically and\\nthermodynamically favorable. This forms a radical species,\\nwhich can potentially fragment to form formic acid. However,\\ndespite this fragmentation reaction being thermodynamically\\nviable, it has a high kinetic barrier (37.5 kcal mol−1). While this\\nbarrier may be surmountable given the elevated temperature and\\npressure experienced in the stripper, it is more likely that another\\nScheme 13.

MPZ Formation from Piperazine. The ﬁnal degrada-\\ntion product that was investigated was MPZ. Scheme 18 shows\\nhow this can be formed from the reaction of piperazine and\\nprotonated methylamine, which itself is a product of EDA\\nradical fragmentation. Figure 20 shows the DFT-calculated\\nenergy proﬁle for the reaction, which is predicted to be\\nkinetically and thermodynamically viable.\\n3.5. Nitrosamine Formation. Nitramines and nitrosamines\\ncan be formed in carbon-capture plants as a result of nitrogen\\noxides (NOx) reacting with amines (mainly secondary amines;\\nprimary amines do not form stable nitrosamines). The\\nenvironmental impact of their release into the atmosphere\\nrepresents a major concern. Hence, a signiﬁcant amount of\\nexperimental research has been conducted to verify the\\nmechanism of formation.43−47\\nHere, we investigated the formation of these species via the\\nreaction of an amine with N2O3. As shown in Scheme 19, there\\nare two primary routes to the formation of the nitrosamine\\nproduct. The amine can act as a nucleophile and attack the “NO”\\ngroup of N2O3. This eliminates NO2\\n−and creates an ion pair.\\nSubsequent nucleophilic attack of NO2\\n−on the N−H forms\\nnitrous acid and a nitrosamine. Alternatively, a concerted\\nreaction can occur, which involves rearrangement of multiple\\natoms at once to form the same products.\\nDespite multiple attempts, a transition state corresponding to\\nthe ﬁrst pathway could not be located. Figure 21 shows the\\nenergy proﬁle for the formation of a nitrosamine from N2O3.\\nThe activation energy is very low (7.2 kcal mol−1) and the\\nreaction energy is also exothermic, suggesting that nitrosamine\\nformation should be very facile.\\nWe carried out similar modeling studies for nitrosamine\\nformation from AEI, AEP, imidazolidinone, HEP, and AEAEPZ,\\nScheme 15.

CONCLUSIONS\\nThe current work reports on DFT calculations exploring the\\nformation of multiple thermal and oxidative degradation\\nproducts of piperazine. Calculated thermodynamic parameters\\nhave been compared against experimental conditions to\\nrationalize which pathways are likely and which are\\nunsurmountable.\\nThe chemistry of piperazine degradation is dominated by\\nnucleophilic substitution reactions and can be facilitated by\\nprotonation of the amine group. It is shown that some of the\\nreactions are very sensitive to the speciﬁc solvent environment of\\nthe reactants. Inclusion of explicit water molecules can\\ndramatically reduce the activation parameters.\\nThe mechanistic pathways and corresponding thermody-\\nnamic data that have been presented here can form the basis for\\nthe construction of a full chemical kinetic model. Such a model\\nwould be further improved by corresponding experimental\\nvalidation studies.\\n■ASSOCIATED CONTENT\\n*\\nsı Supporting Information\\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at\\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c02897.\\nCartesian coordinates for DFT-optimized structures\\n(PDF)\\n■AUTHOR INFORMATION\\nCorresponding Author\\nChristopher Parks −Department of Mechanical Engineering,\\nThe University of Sheﬃeld, Sheﬃeld S3 7RD, U.K.;\\norcid.org/0000-0001-8016-474X; Email: c.m.parks@\\nsheﬃeld.ac.uk\\nAuthors\\nKevin Hughes −Department of Mechanical Engineering, The\\nUniversity of Sheﬃeld, Sheﬃeld S3 7RD, U.K.\\nMohamed Pourkashanian −Department of Mechanical\\nEngineering, The University of Sheﬃeld, Sheﬃeld S3 7RD,\\nU.K.\\nComplete contact information is available at:\\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c02897\\nNotes\\nThe authors declare no competing ﬁnancial interest.\\n■ABBREVIATIONS\\nAEI\\n1-(2-aminoethyl)-2-imidazolidone\\nAEP\\nN-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine\\nAEAEPZ\\n1-[2-[(2-aminoethyl)amino] ethyl] pipera-\\nzine\\nAEAEPZH+\\nprotonated 1-[2-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]\\nethyl] piperazine\\nAEAEPZ-UREA 1-[2-(piperazinyl)ethyl]-2-imidazolidinone\\nDETA\\n1,2-ethanediamine, N1-(2-aminoethyl)\\nHEIA\\nN-(2-aminoethyl)-N′-(2-hydroxyethyl)-\\nimidazolidin-2-one)\\nHEP\\nN-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine\\nPEP\\n1,1′-(1,2-ethandiyl)bis-piperazine\\nPIPH+\\nprotonated piperazine\\nEPZ\\nN-ethylpiperazine MPZ-N-methylpiperazine\\nOPZ\\n2-piperazinone\\nEDA\\nethylenediamine\\nTEDA\\n1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane\\n■REFERENCES\\n(1) Kerr, R.

Even though there are many diﬀerent techniques,\\nno simple and cheap optical method in the visible is available. This work studies\\nplasmonically enhanced optical carbon dioxide sensors in the visible wavelength\\nrange. The sensor samples are based on an inert plasmonic perfect absorber, which\\ncan be easily and cheaply fabricated by colloidal etching lithography. A CO2-\\nsensitive polyethylenimine (PEI) layer is then spin-coated on top to complete the\\nsamples. The samples are examined continuously by microspectroscopy during\\ndiﬀerent CO2 exposures to track spectral changes, particularly the position of the\\nresonance centroid wavelength. The samples exhibit a resonance shift of up to 7 nm,\\ndepending on the CO2 concentration and the temperature. The temperature inﬂuences the rise time as well as the sensitive\\nconcentration range. The concentration dependence of the resonance shift overall follows the shape of a Langmuir isotherm, which\\nincludes a nearly linear relation at lower concentrations and elevated temperatures and a saturating behavior at higher concentrations\\nand lower temperatures. The results indicate that a sensitivity in the full range from 100 vol % to below 1 ppm can be achieved. The\\nsamples degenerate in a dry inert atmosphere in a matter of days but are useable over multiple weeks when exposed to humidity and\\nCO2. The PEI reacts very selectively to CO2, showing no response to CO, NH3, NO2, CH4, H2, and only a very small response to\\nO2. Overall, polyethylenimine is very promising as a CO2-sensitive material for many practical sensing applications over a wide range\\nof concentrations.

This makes this\\ntechnology superior in areas where electronics are disrupted or\\npose a safety risk like in explosive environments. Being\\ncompliant with, for example, the ATEX directive of the\\nEuropean Union is much easier if an optical sensor is used.20\\nCurrently, optical CO2 sensing is mostly done by using its\\ncharacteristic infrared absorption values at 1.6, 2.0, 2.7, and 4.3\\nμm.21 This method is robust, sensitive, and, due to the\\nspeciﬁcity of the absorption wavelengths, also very selective but\\nrequires a large sensing volume and expensive infrared optics.\\nThe sensing scheme used in this paper is based on relatively\\nsimple and cheap plasmonic structures that shift their\\nresonance wavelength upon gas exposure.

Due to the thin ﬁlm interferences,\\nthe unstructured samples show a bright metallic pink color. The top\\ngold layer was then structured by colloidal etching lithography using\\n82 nm polystyrene spheres and an etching time of 60 s in an argon ion\\nbeam etcher.43 This method allows us to structure large area samples\\n(here, 1 × 1 cm2) easily and cheaply in substantial numbers and is\\ntherefore directly usable for an industrial scale fabrication. Afterward,\\nthe residual polystyrene spheres were removed by oxygen plasma\\netching. Due to the structuring, a plasmonic resonance at\\napproximately 620 nm with a reﬂectance of around 1% is present\\n(Figure 1d) and the sample color switches to a deep metallic green.\\nThe resulting disks were arranged randomly with a uniform density\\nFigure 1.

The rings on top of the disks result\\nfrom redeposition of gold beneath the edge of the polystyrene spheres\\nduring the ion beam etching. These rings can be avoided by using a\\nsacriﬁcial layer between the gold layer and the spheres or by carefully\\nmelting the spheres, but since they do not interfere with the sensing,\\nthis step was omitted to keep the fabrication as simple as possible.\\nPure polyethylenimine (PEI; Mw ∼25,000) was purchased from\\nSigma-Aldrich and diluted in water to 10 wt % solution. To enhance\\nthe dissolving, the mixture was stirred for 6 h on a hotplate at 60 °C.\\nThe sample surface was ﬁrst treated by oxygen plasma before 40 μL of\\nPEI (60 °C) was spin-coated at 8000 rpm for 60 s on top of it.

The coated samples were optically\\ncharacterized and studied in a microspectroscopy setup together\\nwith a gas cell (Figure 1e). The microspectroscopy setup consists of a\\nNikon Eclipse LV100 upright microscope combined with a Princeton\\nInstruments IsoPlane-160 spectrometer and a Pixis 256E camera. The\\nillumination was performed by a laser-driven white light source\\n(Energetiq EQ-99XFC), which is coupled into the microscope. All\\nmeasurements were carried out with a Nikon TU Plan Fluor 10×\\nobjective and unpolarized light. Additionally, a motorized and\\ncomputer-controlled stage with a μm precision was installed in the\\nsample plane of the microscope to enable an automated measurement\\nprocess.\\nThe gas cell is custom-designed to ﬁt into the sample holder of the\\nmicroscope stage. It has a thin glass window above the sample holder\\nfor the optical measurements and is equipped with a Peltier element\\ncoupled to a copper block but thermally isolated from the rest of the\\ncell to control the temperature of the sample. A Meerstetter\\nEngineering TEC controller was used to keep the temperature\\nconstant with less than 0.1 °C deviation. The exact temperature at the\\nsample surface was continuously monitored using an NTC temper-\\nature sensor. It should be noted that this precisely tempered and\\nhighly stable temperature is only necessary for a full characterization\\nof the sensor. In a real-world application, it is possible to compensate\\nfor temperature deviations using appropriate algorithms in combina-\\ntion with the known temperature-dependent behavior.29\\nThe gas inlet is connected to a bottle-fed gas mixing system\\nconsisting of multiple Bronkhorst mass ﬂow controllers that can\\nregulate the gas ﬂow rate from 2 to 100% of their maximum ﬂow rate\\nat an accuracy of 0.01% as well as a humidiﬁer. The total gas ﬂow rate\\nwas kept constant at 1 standard l/min (slm) during each\\nmeasurement to ensure a constant pressure inside the gas cell. The\\nused gases are Nitrogen 4.8, Protadur (20 vol % CO2 in N2), and two\\ncustom-mixed test gases with 2000 and 100 ppm CO2 in N2. The\\ncross sensitivities were tested by using synthetic air and forming gas\\n(10 vol % H2 in N2). All gases were purchased from Westfalen AG.\\nThe absolute humidity was kept constant at 0.015 g/L during all\\nmeasurements.\\nThe entire setup is controlled by a single LabVIEW program that\\nautomatically records the reﬂectance spectra of the sample and a\\nFigure 2.

The software also\\ncalculates the spectral reﬂectance of the sample by dividing each\\nsample spectrum by their reference spectrum and then determines the\\ncentroid wavelength of the resonance (Figure S1), which has been\\nshown to be more stable than tracking the minimum.44 Instead of this\\ncomplex setup and the tracking of the resonance, it is also possible to\\nmeasure the intensity change at one of the sides of the resonance,\\nreducing the costs of the setup immensely, as recently shown by\\nHerkert et al. (see Figure S7).22\\n■SENSING BEHAVIOR\\nThe response of the reﬂectance spectrum, especially the\\nresonance centroid wavelength, is tracked during diﬀerent gas\\ncycles at multiple temperatures to study the CO2 concentration\\nand temperature dependence. The used gas cycles are being\\nswitched back and forth between pure nitrogen and a mixture\\nwith carbon dioxide while keeping the overall ﬂow rate\\nconstant.\\nFigure 2a shows the development of the reﬂectance\\nspectrum during a gas cycle with periodically decreasing CO2\\nconcentrations (shown in Figure 2b) at T = 58 °C. The\\nmeasurements exhibit a spectral shift every time the gas\\nmixture changes. At wavelengths below 650 nm, the reﬂectance\\nincreases upon CO2 exposure, while it decreases at wave-\\nlengths above 650 nm. A comparison between a spectrum\\nrecorded right before the change from pure nitrogen to a\\nnitrogen CO2 mixture (#1) and one right before switching\\nback (#2) shows that this happens due to a shift of the\\nresonance to higher wavelengths. The tracking of the\\nresonance (centroid) wavelength, which is marked by the\\nwhite line, shows that this happens at every exposure of the\\nsample to CO2, even for lower concentrations.\\nFigure 2b demonstrates the resonance shift during the gas\\ncycle drawn below, which alternates each 600 s between pure\\nnitrogen and a mixture of nitrogen and CO2. The CO2\\nconcentration in the mixture is reduced stepwise from 2000\\n(0.2 vol %) to 100 ppm (0.01 vol %). All three measurements\\nwere done on the same spot of the same sample while changing\\nonly the temperature. A simple drift correction was applied to\\nthe time traces to compensate for systematic drift, such as focal\\ndrift or spatial drift of the setup during long measurement\\ncycles (see Figure S3). At T = 51 °C, the ﬁrst ﬁve CO2\\nexposures reveal nearly the same maximum shift and still a\\nstrong slope at the end of the CO2 exposure. For a\\nconcentration below 1000 ppm, the maximum shift indicates\\na stronger concentration dependence and the system reaches a\\nstate closer to equilibrium during the CO2 exposure. At 100\\nppm, the equilibrium is reached nearly instantaneously. At\\nhigher temperatures, a concentration dependence is clearly\\nvisible over the entire measured concentration range and the\\nequilibrium is reached much faster than at T = 51 °C. The\\nsame holds true for the relaxation after switching back to pure\\nnitrogen: at higher temperatures, the resonance reverts to the\\nbase state nearly instantaneously, while this takes a couple of\\nminutes at lower temperatures (see also Figure S5b). The short\\nspikes right before and after the switching of the gas mixture as\\nwell as the sometimes increased noise result from instabilities\\nof the humidiﬁer.\\nThe diﬀerent saturation and relaxations times result from a\\nfaster diﬀusion and an increased reaction rate due to the higher\\ntemperatures. Please note that the absorption and desorption\\nof CO2 in the PEI are diﬀerent chemical reactions and\\ntherefore also diﬀer in their dynamics.38 To explain the\\ndiﬀerent shifts at the same concentrations but diﬀerent\\ntemperatures, it is necessary to take a closer look at the\\nreaction of the amines and the CO2. In a simpliﬁed form, the\\nreaction is\\n+\\nF\\namines\\nCO\\ncarbamates\\n2\\nSince the reaction is reversible, an equilibrium forms at a\\nspeciﬁc ratio between amines and carbamates, which depends\\non a number of diﬀerent parameters. The inﬂuence of a\\nvariation of some of these parameters can be predicted by Le\\nChatelier’s principle, which states that a system in equilibrium\\ntries to mitigate the inﬂuence of parameter changes by shifting\\nits equilibrium.45 In the case of a temperature increase, this\\nmeans that the equilibrium will shift to the endothermic side.\\nThe reaction of amines and CO2 is exothermic, which means\\nthat the equilibrium will shift to the left at higher system\\ntemperatures and to the right at lower ones. Since the\\ncarbamates on the right side of the reaction are responsible for\\nthe refractive index change of PEI and therefore directly\\nconnected to the resonance shift, this leads to a smaller\\nresonance shift at higher temperatures.\\nThe same principle is responsible for the concentration\\ndependence: if more CO2 is added to the system by increasing\\nthe concentration in the mixture, then the equilibrium shifts to\\nthe right to lessen the change, which leads to more carbamates\\nand therefore also to a higher shift. As shown in Figure 2b, it\\ntakes the sensor in most cases over 600 s to reach equilibrium\\nat T = 51 °C. At higher concentrations and lower\\ntemperatures, this time increases even more; for instance, an\\nexposure of a sample to 5000 ppm (0.5 vol %) CO2 at 20 °C\\ndid not reach equilibrium even after 40 min (Figure S5a). To\\nstill be able to estimate reasonable data points here, a simple\\nmodel of the CO2 absorption process was developed to\\nextrapolate the resonance shift at equilibrium from the\\nbeginning of the time series. This is even more important in\\nreal applications as it is often not feasible to wait until a\\ncomplete saturation is reached. A more sophisticated model for\\na hydrogen sensor presented by Teutsch et al. proves that it is\\npossible to estimate the gas concentration accurately from the\\nﬁrst few seconds of an exposure.29 Please note that we only\\nconsider the CO2 absorption process in our model as\\nequilibrium is always reached within the recorded desorption\\nperiod (see Figure 2b), making it unnecessary to extrapolate\\nthe time series after decreasing the CO2 concentration to zero.\\nThe resonance shift depends in the present range of change\\nlinearly on the refractive index.46 On the other hand, it is\\nreasonable to estimate that the change of the refractive index\\ndepends linearly on the amount of reacted amines.47 For\\nnanoporous polymers, this amount follows the shape of a\\nLangmuir isotherm.35,37,38,48,49 Meanwhile, according to\\nHenry’s law, the CO2 concentration in equilibrium is the\\nsame in the entire PEI layer; it is determined by the diﬀusion\\nof the CO2 through the PEI otherwise.49 Therefore, the time\\ndynamics are added by using the CO2 concentration c(t) in the\\npolymer as the input value for the Langmuir isotherms\\nλ\\nΔ ∝Δ ∝\\n·\\n+\\n·\\nn\\na c t\\nb c t\\n( )\\n1\\n( )\\nwith a and b being ﬁtting parameters, t is the time, and c(t) is\\ngiven by the solution of the diﬀusion equation for a plane with\\nconstant concentrations on the surface.50 Details can be found\\nin the Supporting Information.\\nACS Sensors\\npubs.acs.org/acssensors\\nArticle\\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.0c01151\\nACS Sens. 2020, 5, 2628−2635\\n2631\\nEven though the model is able to extrapolate the course of\\nthe resonance shift over time upon CO2 exposure very well\\n(see the Supporting Information, Figure S4), it is still a\\nsimpliﬁed model and therefore not able to predict the\\nresonance shift at equilibrium completely accurately. Still, it\\ngives a much better grasp of the behavior of the sensor than the\\ndata points taken directly from the unsaturated measurements.\\nIn case the equilibrium is reached, like in Figure 2b at T = 58\\n°C, the model matches the measurements nearly perfectly.\\nFigure 3a shows the mean resonance shift that is reached by\\nthe ﬁtted model in equilibrium at diﬀerent concentrations and\\ntemperatures and its standard deviation for a total of 102 CO2\\nexposures measured on ﬁve diﬀerent samples. The measure-\\nments were carried out by using a custom mixed test gas\\ncontaining 2000 ppm CO2 in N2 at a constant ﬂow rate of 1\\nslm.\\nAs argued before, the resonance shift in equilibrium upon\\nCO2 absorption approximately follows a Langmuir isotherm.\\nThis is conﬁrmed here, as illustrated by the dashed lines in\\nFigure 3a. The Langmuir isotherms ﬁt well to the\\nconcentration dependence of the resonance shift, allowing\\nfor a reliable interpolation of the resonance shift at any\\nconcentration.\\nThe resonance shift exhibits a saturating concentration\\ndependence at T = 51 °C, starting with a steep slope and\\ntherefore also a high sensitivity, which decreases with\\nincreasing concentration. The data points at T = 58 and 65\\n°C show in general a lower resonance shift but a nearly linear\\nbehavior and therefore a constant sensitivity over the measured\\nconcentration range. This leads to a higher sensitivity for low\\nconcentrations at low temperatures and a higher sensitivity for\\nhigh concentrations at high temperatures, which means that it\\nis possible to tune the sensitive concentration range by\\nadjusting the temperature.\\nFigure 3b displays the rise time from 10 to 90% of the\\nmaximum shift acquired from the ﬁts of our model to the\\nmeasurements. As for the resonance shift, the model does not\\ngive accurate values above 600 s but more of an estimate of the\\nconcentration and temperature dependence. Nevertheless, the\\nvalues ﬁt well with the experiences from the experiments.\\nWhile the rise time shows a clear concentration dependence at\\n51 °C, it is nearly constant at higher temperatures, which\\nmeans that the mechanism is limiting the changes. One\\npossible explanation is that, at higher temperatures, the\\ndelivery of CO2 to the amines (diﬀusion) is the limiting\\nfactor, in contrast to the reaction speed of the amines with\\nCO2 at lower temperatures. This would also ﬁt the two steps\\n(diﬀusion and adsorption) of our model.\\nOverall, Figure 3 reveals a strong diﬀerence in the behavior\\nof the system between 51 and 58 °C, which suggests a\\nstructural change in the PEI ﬁlm and should be further\\ninvestigated in future research.\\nAs indicated in Figure 3a, it is possible to shift the sensitive\\nconcentration range by changing the temperature. This also\\nholds true for higher concentrations. Figure 4 depicts the\\nresonance shift at equilibrium obtained by ﬁtting our model to\\nthe measurements at higher concentrations than Figure 3a.\\nThe other measurement parameters were kept the same as\\nbefore.\\nThe resonance shift in this concentration range still follows\\nthe same basic behavior as in Figure 3a and can be described\\nwell by Langmuir isotherms, which are indicated by the dashed\\nlines. Even though the temperatures were increased up to T =\\n73 °C, still, no linearity occurs. Instead, both temperatures\\ndisplay a saturating behavior similar to the 51 °C data in Figure\\n3a. With increasing temperature, the saturation kink smears\\nout stronger and the slope of the Langmuir isotherm at 15 vol\\n% increases, which means that the sensitivity increases in the\\nhigher concentration range. This supports the statement from\\nbefore that the sensitive concentration range is tunable by the\\ntemperature. Additionally, this indicates that the sensor is able\\nto measure up to 100 vol % CO2 if the temperature is increased\\nsuﬃciently. Since PEI starts to decompose at 225 °C according\\nFigure 3.

The data points\\nand error bars are calculated with our model of the CO2 absorption\\nusing measurements of ﬁve diﬀerent samples and a total of 102 CO2\\nexposures.

To test very low concentrations, a custom test\\ngas containing 100 ppm CO2 in N2 is used. The minimum gas\\nﬂow rate that can be reached with the used mass ﬂow\\ncontrollers is 0.053 slm. Therefore, a stable concentration of\\n1.5 ppm was reached at a total ﬂow rate of 4 slm. The\\nhumidiﬁer was adjusted accordingly to keep the humidity\\nconstant at 0.015 g/L. Figure 5 shows the time trace of the\\nresonance shift during a gas cycle changing from 10 to 1.5 ppm\\nCO2 at a temperature of 33 °C. Even though the saturation\\nand relaxation times are quite high due to the reduced\\ntemperature and the signal does not reach a complete\\nequilibrium, all concentrations indicate a clear resonance\\nshift. From a comparison of the Langmuir isotherm of a\\nprevious measurement at 40 °C, which reached equilibrium\\nmuch better with its corresponding noise level, a theoretical\\ndetection limit of 400 ppb CO2 is estimated (see Figure S6).\\n■DEGRADATION AND CROSS SENSITIVITIES\\nThe amines in PEI can degrade by either oxidation or by urea\\nformation. In the ﬁrst case, oxygen reacts with the amines and\\nforms stable amides and oximes. This reaction requires free\\namines and therefore cannot happen if CO2 is bound to them.\\nIn the latter case, two amines react together with CO2 to urea.\\nThis can be prevented by adding humidity.51,52 To enhance\\nthe degradation resistance further, Zhai and Chuang proposed\\nto blend the PEI with polyvinylalcohol (PVA).53\\nHeydari-Gorji and Sayari showed already that the CO2\\nuptake of PEI-containing adsorbents was stable for 300\\nadsorption−desorption cycles at 75 °C in humid conditions.52\\nTo test the long-term stability of the samples, fresh samples\\nhave been fabricated and measured repeatedly with the same\\ngas cycle (1 vol % CO2 for 600 s at T = 51 °C) over the course\\nof 3 weeks. Two of the samples are coated with pure PEI and\\none with a blend of PEI and PVA. One PEI sample was stored\\nbetween the measurements in a nitrogen-ﬂooded box, while\\nthe blended sample was stored together with the other PEI\\nsample in ambient conditions. Figure 6a shows the develop-\\nment of the observed resonance shift during the diﬀerent\\nmeasurements. Since the samples were removed from the\\nmeasurement setup after each measurement, it was not\\npossible to measure the same position on the sample each\\ntime. Instead, care was taken to use a position with a similar\\nreﬂectance spectrum each time for the individual samples.\\nThe sample stored in nitrogen exhibits the fastest\\ndegradation, which can be attributed to urea forming inside\\nthe PEI due to the lack of humidity. After 10 days, nearly no\\nreaction at all is visible anymore. In contrast, the two samples\\nstored in ambient conditions show much less degradation and\\nare still usable after 3 weeks. Even though the sample coated\\nwith pure PEI exhibits a stronger shift in the beginning, the\\nPEI/PVA-blend coated sample exhibits a slightly weaker slope\\nover time. It has been shown in the literature that PEI does not\\nreact with other complex gases such as CO, NH3, NO2, and\\nCH4.54 Figure 6b shows a time trace of the resonance shift\\nduring the exposure of a sample to diﬀerent gases for 600 s\\neach at a constant ﬂow rate of 1 slm and a temperature of T =\\n51 °C. While the sample shows a strong reaction to 1 vol %\\nCO2, it does not respond to 3 vol % hydrogen and is much\\nweaker to 20 vol % oxygen (all mixed with N2). The exposure\\nto oxygen led to a degradation of PEI and therefore to a\\npermanent change of the resonance position and a weaker\\nresponse to CO2. Even though the hydrogen did not inﬂuence\\nthe sample in any way, it may be possible to trigger a\\nmethylation of the amines using the gold disks as a catalyst.55\\nThe peaks at 600 s result from a short instability of the gas\\nmixing system due to the switching of the gas mixture.\\nFigure 5.

We\\nshowed that the sensor sample reacts to CO2 by red-shifting its\\nresonance wavelength due to the reaction of the contained\\namines with CO2. The resonance shift as well as the rise time\\nincrease with increasing CO2 concentration and decreasing\\ntemperature. The shape of a Langmuir isotherm can model the\\nresonance shift. Furthermore, it was shown that it is possible to\\ntune the sensitive concentration range by changing the\\ntemperature. While the humidity is kept constant in this\\npaper, it is necessary to study the impact of diﬀerent humidities\\nin future research to fully characterize the sensor. The\\nminimum detected concentration was 1.5 ppm CO2 at T =\\n33 °C, while the lower detection limit was estimated to be as\\nlow as 400 ppb. By increasing the temperature, a concentration\\nof 15 vol % (15.000 ppm) was measured at T = 73 °C, but the\\nsystem should be able to detect up to pure CO2 at suﬃciently\\nhigh temperatures. Over the course of 3 weeks, samples stored\\nat ambient conditions showed only a slight degradation, while\\nsamples stored in nitrogen were unusable after 10 days. No\\ncross sensitivity to hydrogen and only a small cross sensitivity\\nto oxygen were found. This demonstrates that PEI-covered\\nplasmonic structures oﬀer a versatile sensor design that can\\naccess a very broad range of concentrations.\\nThis CO2 sensor sample can be integrated in future studies\\ninto a single wavelength sensor such as the one shown by\\nHerkert et al. to reduce the complexity and cost of the\\nsensor.22 This would make the sensor even more interesting\\nfor applications where carbon dioxide is mixed with an\\nexplosive gas like in the fabrication of synthetic fuels where\\nhydrogen is included.56\\n■ASSOCIATED CONTENT\\n*\\nsı Supporting Information\\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at\\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssensors.0c01151.\\nData Processing\\ue0d5referencing, centroid detection, drift\\ncorrection, and ﬁtting model; measurement at room\\ntemperature; determination of the theoretical lower\\ndetection limit; and intensity change at a ﬁxed\\nwavelength upon CO2 exposure (PDF)\\n■AUTHOR INFORMATION\\nCorresponding Authors\\nTobias Pohl −4th Physics Institute and Research Center SCoPE,\\nUniversity of Stuttgart, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany;\\norcid.org/0000-0003-3028-8992; Email: t.pohl@pi4.uni-\\nstuttgart.de\\nHarald Giessen −4th Physics Institute and Research Center\\nSCoPE, University of Stuttgart, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany;\\nEmail: giessen@pi4.uni-stuttgart.de\\nAuthors\\nFlorian Sterl −4th Physics Institute and Research Center\\nSCoPE, University of Stuttgart, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany;\\norcid.org/0000-0002-1025-6777\\nNikolai Strohfeldt −4th Physics Institute and Research Center\\nSCoPE, University of Stuttgart, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany\\nComplete contact information is available at:\\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/acssensors.0c01151\\nNotes\\nThe authors declare no competing ﬁnancial interest.\\n■ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the ﬁnancial support by\\nERC (COMPLEXPLAS), by the Baden-Württemberg Stiftung,\\nby the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, by the Bundesmi-\\nnisterium für Bildung und Forschung, and by the Ministerium\\nfür Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-Württemberg.\\n■REFERENCES\\n(1) British Petroleum BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019 |\\n68th Edition; British Petroleum, 2019; Vol. 68.\\n(2) Fox, C.

        "Title": "'Incorporating Catalytic Units into Nanomaterials: Rational Design of\\nMultipurpose Catalysts for CO2 Valorization\\n'",
        "Abstract": "'in ethylene carbonate solvent, in which base is used to abstract\\nthe proton and the metal catalyst stabilizes the formed\\nnucleophile via forming a C−M bond.19,20 To develop the\\nheterogeneous catalytic protocol, we immobilized CuBr on the\\nactivated carbon to increase the catalytic site number and\\nachieve catalyst recycling.21 With Cs2CO3 as the cocatalyst, up\\nto 90% yield of alkynyl carboxylic acids can be obtained under 1\\nbar of CO2 (Figure 5A). It should be mentioned that the\\nsupported catalyst can be reused and the recovered catalyst\\npresents a higher yield of product in the second and third runs\\nattributed to the partial reduction of Cu(II) species (Figure 5B).\\nMOF is also an attractive catalyst for the carboxylation of a\\nterminal alkyne with CO2. Considering the solvent and thermal\\nstabilities of heterometallic MOFs and the effectiveness of CuI\\nfor the carboxylation reaction of terminal alkyne, we further\\nprepared the [CuxIy] clusters containing heterometallic MOFs\\nby altering the Gd precursors (Gd(NO3)3·6H2O and Gd2O3)\\nand their molar ratios to CuI using isonicotinic acid as an organic\\nligand. Consequently, two novel heterometallic 3D MOFs\\nconsisting of both a Gd cluster and [Cu12I12] and [Cu3I2]\\nclusters, respectively, were obtained (Figure 5C and 5D).22 It is\\nrevealed that the Cu(I) atoms in the above Cu clusters are four-\\ncoordinate, and the coordination unsaturated sites render the\\nactivation of alkynes, thus facilitating the carboxylation of\\nterminal alkyne and affording a moderate yield of carboxylation\\nproducts under mild conditions.\\n2.1.3. Carboxylative Cyclization with CO2. Carboxylative\\ncyclization with CO2 represents another important CO2\\ntransformation protocol in which the substrates containing a\\nnucleophilic site such as amine, hydroxyl, or acidic C−H and an\\nelectrophilic site such as the C−C double or triple bond are\\nusually involved. To catalyze this transformation, a Lewis acid\\nand base are necessary to active the unsaturated bond and\\nnucleophilic site, respectively. Our previous studies show that\\nthe Lewis acidic Ag or Zn salts are effective in activating the\\ncarbon−carbon triple bonds owing to their π-coordination with\\nthe alkyne, thus exhibiting superior catalytic activity.23−25\\nInspired by the effectiveness of the Ag-based catalyst, we\\nfurther prepared the reduced graphene oxide-supported Ag\\nnanoparticles and explored their activity in the carboxylative\\ncyclization of propargyl amine or propargyl alcohol with CO2\\n(Figure 6A).26 With a catalytic amount of ionic liquid\\n[N4444][Triz] as a base, the cyclic carbonate or oxazolidinone\\nproducts can be accessed in 82−99% yield under 1 bar of CO2.\\nMoreover, these supported Ag nanoparticles can also be used in\\nthe cascade reaction of the carboxylative cyclization of propargyl\\nalcohol and subsequent nucleophilic ring-opening reaction with\\namine, generating β-oxopropylcarbamate in 86% yield. The\\nleaching test excluded the possibility of catalyst dissolution and\\nshowed the heterogeneous catalysis features. Furthermore, the\\nheterogeneous catalyst can be reused without obvious activity\\ndecay (Figure 6B and 6C). It is deduced that the reduced\\ngraphene oxide can not only inhibit the agglomeration of the\\nnanoparticles but also alter the electronic structure of the Ag\\nnanoparticles and thus increase their Lewis acidity.\\nThe excellent performance of the Zn-based complex in\\ncatalyzing the carboxylative cyclization with CO2 encourages us\\nto pursue a Zn-based MOF as a catalyst. As a result, a zinc-\\ntetrazole 3D MOF with the giant and lantern-like [Zn116]\\nnanocages was synthesized using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and the in\\nsitu-generated ligand tri(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)methanol (Figure\\n6D).3 This MOF features thermostability, solvent stability,\\nand pH stability as well as Lewis acidity. Notably, the porous\\nframework of this MOF possesses a CO2 uptake of 27.00 cm3 g−1\\nat ambient pressure at 25 °C, which makes it especially suitable\\nfor CO2 conversion. The calculation results show that this\\nmaterial can activate propargylamine and CO2 concurrently\\n(Figure 6E). Consequently, it presents high catalytic activity for\\nthe carboxylative cyclization of propargylic amines and CO2\\nwith TBD (1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene) as the cocata-\\nlyst, giving up to 99% yield of oxazolidinone products under mild\\nconditions with excellent reusability (Figure 6F).\\n2.2. Reductive Transformation of CO2\\nReductive CO2 transformation implies a decrease in the CO2\\noxidation state and has gained sustained attention due to its\\nability to access fuels and various important chemicals, among\\nwhich the reductive functionalization of CO2, i.e., CO2\\nreduction accompanied by new C−X bond formation, breaks\\nthrough the limitation of the CO2 valence state; therefore, CO2\\ncan be used as a methylation, methylenation, or formylation\\nreagent for a suitable nucleophile.27,28\\nOur group concentrates on catalyst development and product\\nregulation for the reductive functionalization of CO2 with amine\\nusing hydrosilane as a reductant. It is found that the slightly polar\\nSi−H bond in hydrosilanes can be activated by silicophilic\\nspecies such as the carboxylate anion by forming a hypervalent\\nsilicon intermediate.29,30 In particular, we found that the\\norganocatalyst, i.e., betaine with a carboxylate anion, can achieve\\na hierarchical reduction of CO2 with amines, affording\\nformamides, aminals, and methylamines, by adjusting the\\namount of CO2, pressure, and reaction temperature.4\\nInspired by this finding, N-doped porous carbon containing\\npyridinic N and pyrrolic N is applied to the reductive\\nfunctionalization of CO2 with amine, considering that the\\nsilicophilic carbamate anion can be formed by capturing CO2\\n(Figure 7A). For example, Cao et al. applied N-doped porous\\ncarbon from the pyrolysis of chitosan and NaNH2 to the\\nreductive functionalization of CO2 with amines, affording\\nformamide at moderate to excellent yield with PhSiH3 as a\\nFigure 7.

Novel CO2 Conversion Strategies\\nCO2 capture and in situ catalysis, i.e, using the captured CO2 as\\nthe surrogate of gaseous CO2 to participate in the subsequent\\ncatalysis, are considered to function as a novel CO2 conversion\\nstrategy to avoid the energy-intensive CO2 desorption step for\\nabsorbent recovery; therefore, this is becoming a vibrant\\nresearch area. More importantly, adsorbed CO2 is usually\\npresent as a bent structure instead of its original linear structure,\\nwhich can be considered to be the activated form and\\npresumably facilitates the subsequent transformation smoothly\\nunder mild conditions even at atmospheric pressure. We have\\nproposed such an in situ CO2 conversion protocol, i.e., the\\nintegration of absorption with subsequent conversion by\\ndeveloping CO2 capture reagents as illustrated in Figure\\n8A.1,33−35 Benefitting from the tailored active sites and\\nheterogeneous characteristics, nanomaterials are promising\\ncandidates facilitating CO2 capture and in situ transformation.\\nBiomass-based N-rich porous carbon provides a platform to\\nperform CO2 capture and in situ conversion due to its ability to\\nabsorb and activate CO2 by N-containing groups and to\\nimmobilize molecular catalysts via a van der Waals interaction.\\nBased on this, our group prepared N-rich porous carbon by\\npyrolysis and the activation of bean dregs. This material can be\\nused to support Zn-based catalysts and capture CO2, which then\\nserve as the CO2 source and catalyst to promote the\\ncarboxylative cyclization of propargylamine facilitated by\\norganic base TBD, giving an excellent yield of oxazolidinone\\nproduct (Figure 8B).36 Remarkably, the N-rich porous carbon\\nsupported with the Zn catalyst can be recovered and reused\\nwithout obvious activity decay.\\nIn particular, MOFs are widely used in CO2 capture and in situ\\nconversion. Recently, Jiang et al. prepared the MOF-poly(ionic\\nliquid) composite material by incorporating imidazolium-based\\npoly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) into the pores of MIL-101 via in situ\\npolymerization of encapsulated monomers (Figure 8C).37 The\\nresultant composite material possesses Lewis acid and base sites\\nas well as good CO2 capture capability, which can work\\nsynergistically to facilitate the cycloaddition of diluted CO2 with\\nepoxides, forming cyclic carbonates in excellent yield.\\n3. PHOTO-/ELECTROCATALYTIC CO2 REDUCTIVE\\nCONVERSION\\nThe photo-/electrocatalytic CO2 reductive conversion utilizes\\nthe electrons from photoexcitation or an external electric field to\\nrealize CO2 reduction, and this field has become increasingly\\npopular due to its ability to use renewable solar energy under\\nmild conditions. In PCO2RR and ECO2RR, CO2 can be reduced\\nto energetic small molecules such as CO, CH3OH, CH4, C2H4,\\nCH3CH2OH, etc. (Figure 9A). Then the CO2 reductive\\nFigure 8.

Recently, the coupling of PCO2RR/ECO2RR\\nwith organic compound oxidation has attracted much concern\\nbecause of its ability to avoid expensive sacrificial agents\\nnecessary in photocatalytic CO2 reduction and replace the\\nsluggish O2 evolution reaction in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction\\n(Figure 9C). Moreover, valuable oxidative products can be\\nobtained concomitantly with CO2 reduction by deliberately\\nselecting the substrate.\\nIn the aforementioned photo-/electrocatalytic CO2 reduction\\nstrategies, molecular complexes as listed in Figure 10 have\\nattracted much concern due to their well-defined structure and\\nexplicable reaction mechanism.38−40 However, these molecular\\ncomplexes encounter limited energy efficiency and stability\\nissues.\\n3.1. Photo-/Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to\\nEnergy-Intensive Molecules\\nBased on the effectiveness of complex fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl on\\nthe photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO, our group put effort\\ninto modifying its ligand skeleton or attaching specific functional\\ngroups to its second shell. As a result, the visible light absorption\\nability, electron transfer efficiency, and excited (triplet) state\\nlifetime are enhanced, improving the performance of the\\nphotocatalyst (Figure 10A).41−44\\nThe positive effect of the structure modification to fac-\\nRe(bpy)(CO)3Cl motivates us to incorporate this catalytically\\nactive unit into the nanomaterials and regulate the chemical\\nenvironment near the catalytic centers. According to the\\nstrategies depicted in Figure 10B, we prepared two kinds of\\nporous organometallic polymers (POMPs) containing a Re-\\nbipyridine complex. One is obtained by copolymerizing the Re-\\nbipyridine complex with the ionic liquid (POMP-IL) (Figure\\n11A−11C), in which the distribution of the Re-bipyridine\\nFigure 9.

For POMP-IL, the catalytic activity and selectivity\\nto CO increases with the content of IL, and optimal values are\\nobtained when equimolar Re-bipyridine and IL precursors are\\nused in POMP-IL preparation.

To address the above issues and at last\\nrealize the artificial photosynthesis in an aqueous solution, we\\nsynthesized a triblock amphiphilic polymer containing the Re-\\nbipyridine complex in its backbone under the collaboration with\\nD. J. Darensbourg’s group (Figure 12A). When the molar ratio\\nof propylene oxide (PO) and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) is 1:1,\\nthe resulting amphiphilic polymer can form stable and uniform\\nspherical micelles in deionized water containing triethanolamine\\nvia self-assembly, where the Re-bipyridine unit is located in the\\nhydrophobic portion of the nanostructured micelle (Figure\\n12B).4 In PCO2RR, the hydrophilic outer layer can promote the\\nstability and uniform dispersion of the micelles, while the\\nhydrophobic long polycarbonate chains can not only suppress\\nthe dimerization deactivation of the Re species but also provide a\\nhigh local CO2 concentration around the catalytic center.\\nFurthermore, the insulation of the Re complex from water can\\ninhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction. Consequently, the\\nmicellar catalysts showed higher efficiency (TONCO up to 110),\\ndurability, and CO selectivity (99%) compared to the\\nRe(dcbpy)(CO)3Cl molecular catalyst, without the need for\\nan additional photosensitizer (Figure 12C).\\nDeveloping efficient catalysts based on earth-abundant\\nmetals47−49 for PCO2RR is also attractive and challenging,\\namong which Fe-porphyrin complexes are proven to be\\nappealing catalysts for this purpose. To improve the stability\\nand catalytic activity of Fe-porphyrin complexes, we synthesized\\ntwo Fe-porphyrin-based POP materials as depicted in Figure\\n13A.50 The as-synthesized POP-Fe nanomaterials have spherical\\nstructures with ferric and chlorine atoms uniformly distributed\\non the surface (Figure 13B). In PCO2RR, these two materials\\ncan generate CO and H2 simultaneously in DMF solvent with\\nRu(bpy)3Cl2 as a photosensitizer, and the linkers between the\\ncatalytic centers can particularly affect the CO/H2 selectivity\\n(Figure 13C). In comparison with POP1-Fe, POP2-Fe shows\\nrelatively high activity in the production of both CO and H2,\\nprobably due to its suitable redox potential to accept electrons\\nfrom the excited photosensitizer and then transfer them to CO2\\nas presented in Figure 13D.\\nFigure 13.

Chem. Res. 2023, 56, 2225−2240\\n2234\\nIn another work, the 2D ultrathin metal−organic layers\\n(MOLs) with two different kinds of metal-based catalytic\\ncenters, i.e., Ni-Ni-MOL and Ni-Co-MOL, are prepared from\\nbidentate ligand 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylate and Ni(II) or\\nNi(II) and Co(II) (Figure 13E).51 For comparison, Ni-Ni-MOF\\nand Ni-s-MOL are also prepared with 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-\\ndicarboxylate and naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid as ligands,\\nrespectively. It is detected that Ni-Ni-MOL and Ni-Co-MOL\\npossess higher metal content than the bulky Ni-Ni-MOF, and, as\\nexpected, they present high efficiency in PCO2RR with\\nRu(phen)3(PF6)2 (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) as the photo-\\nsensitizer in aqueous solution, where Ni-Ni-MOL shows higher\\nselectivity to CO (Figure 13F). The mechanism investigation\\nreveals that the ultrathin layer structure contributes to the\\nenhanced electron transfer efficiency, and the different nickel-\\nbased catalytic centers (Ni-O metal node and the Ni-bipyridine\\nunit) at a reasonable distance can work synergistically to give\\nhigh performance in PCO2RR (Figure 13G).\\nThe development of a multifunctional electrocatalyst for\\nECO2RR is becoming a hotly pursued research area. In this\\nregard, the sulfylphenoxy-decorated cobalt phthalocyanine\\n(CoPcS4) is synthesized and then immobilized onto the carbon\\ncloth electrode surface via in situ polymerization of pyrrole,\\ngenerating sulfylphenoxy-decorated CoPc cross-linked poly-\\npyrrole on the electrode surface (CoPcS4-Ppy-CC) (Figure\\n14A).52 The strong electronic interactions between polypyrrole\\nand sulfylphenoxy-decorated CoPc can prevent the aggregation\\nof CoPc. Moreover, by utilizing the impressive electronic\\ntransfer efficiency and CO2 capture and activation capabilities of\\npolypyrrole, this catalyst has demonstrated a faradaic efficiency\\n(FE) for CO of over 90%, even with diluted CO2. (Figure 14B).\\nBy contrast, the homogeneous CoPcS4 can promote H2\\nevolution only under the same conditions, demonstrating the\\ncrucial role of polypyrrole in ECO2RR. It is assumed that the\\npolypyrrole can absorb CO2 and facilitate subsequent CO2\\ncoordination with reduced Co(I), and then electron transfer\\nand proton coupling occur to form CO, followed by CO\\ndesorption and catalytic species regeneration (Figure 14C).\\n3.2. Photo-/Electrocatalysis for the Reductive\\nFunctionalization of CO2\\nWith our ongoing exploration of the photo/electrocatalytic CO2\\nreduction to CO and inspired by the success of CO2\\nelectroreduction coupled to the carbonylation reaction,53,54 we\\nproposed the strategy of the photoreductive functionalization of\\nCO2 based on the integration of CO2 photoreduction and the\\ncascade transformation of such reductive products. Accordingly,\\nwe developed a protocol composed of photocatalytic CO2\\nreduction to CO and the Pd-catalyzed carbonylation reaction,\\nin which a pipeline was used to transport the in situ-generated\\nCO from the CO2 reduction reactor to the carbonylation\\nreactor. As a result, biaryl ketones, amides, esters, and even\\npharmaceuticals such as fenofibrate are produced in high yields\\n(Figure 15A).55 This protocol paves an alternative avenue for\\nCO2 utilization by harnessing solar energy.\\nRecently, Lu’s group realized the visible-light-driven one-pot\\ncarbonylation reaction under 1 bar of CO2 at room temperature\\nusing an MOF material containing a Co single site, an ultrafine\\nCuPd nanocluster, and porphyrin photosensitizers.56 This\\ncomposite material can be easily prepared by the in situ\\nreduction of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and K2PdCl4 in the presence of\\nFigure 14.

In the reaction, the MOF structure can harvest\\nlight energy, and the excited electrons are then transferred to Co\\nsites for CO2 reduction. After that, the ultrafine CuPd\\nnanocluster encapsulated in the MOF promoted the Suzuki/\\nSonogashira reactions with in situ-generated CO, giving the\\ntarget products in over 90% yield and 97% selectivity (Figure\\n15B).\\n3.3. Electrocatalytic CO2 Valorization Integrated with\\nOrganic Synthesis\\nConventionally, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs on\\nthe anode in ECO2RR. Recently, replacing OER with organic\\ncompound oxidation in ECO2RR has become an attractive field\\nbecause this strategy has great potential to lower electricity\\nconsumption and get valuable oxidation products.57,58\\nGuided by this, we paired ECO2RR and 5-hydroxymethyl-\\nfurfural (HMF) oxidation using the noncovalently immobilized\\n4-(tert-butyl)-phenoxy cobalt phthalocyanine (TBP-CoPc) and\\npyrene-tethered 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxy (Py-\\nTEMPO) on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as electrocatalysts,\\nrespectively (Figure 16A).59,60 These two supported catalysts\\ncan be used in the electrolytic cell with trielectrode or\\ndielectrode configuration (Figure 16B and 16C). Even with\\nthe cell voltage input from the solar panel, 95.4% selectivity and a\\nturnover number of 52 172 for CO and a 69.9% yield of 2,5-\\nfurandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) can still be achieved. In order to\\nregulate the reduction product of ECO2RR, we fabricated a\\nbismuth-based MOF cathode through the solvothermal method\\nusing 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid and Bi3+ and then loaded it on\\ncarbon paper (Bi-FDCA MOF) as the cathode (Figure\\n16D−16F). When paired with 5-hydroxymethylfurfural\\n(HMF) oxidation at the Ni(OH)2/carbon paper-based anode\\nin a trielectrode electrolytic cell, 95.6% FEHCOOH (Faraday\\nefficiency) is achieved concomitant with 75.0% FE for FDCA\\n(Figure 16G). It is revealed that the bismuth-based MOF can be\\nin situ transformed to bismuth carbon oxide during electrolysis\\n(Figure 16H,16I), which acts as an active catalyst for HCOOH\\ngeneration.\\n4. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVE\\nBy far, thermocatalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis are\\nconsidered to be the three main strategies for performing CO2\\nvalorization. As listed in Table 1, several thermocatalytic CO2\\nconversions have been industrialized, while the photo- and\\nelectrocatalysis are still in the R&D stage. To improve the\\ntechnical economy, developing low-cost, highly efficient, and\\nrobust catalysts is crucial.\\nIn this Account, we summarize our work on CO2 conversion\\nstrategies and corresponding catalyst development in the past\\ndecade. In the early stage of our research, we focused on\\nexploring novel CO2 conversion strategies and gaining insight\\ninto the activation and transformation mechanism of CO2. As a\\nconsequence, CO2 capture and in situ transformation, visible\\nlight-driven photoreductive functionalization, and renewable\\nenergy-facilitated CO2 conversion were proposed, and highly\\nefficient molecular catalysts were developed accordingly.\\nFigure 15.

In this current study, an amine-ampliﬁed chemically reactive\\ncoating on ﬁbrous cotton has been unprecedentedly developed for facile\\ntailoring of diﬀerent water wettability through the 1,4-conjugate addition\\nreaction under ambient conditions. Further, these amine-ampliﬁed\\ninterfaces having tailored water wettability were extended to investigate\\nindependently the role of: (a) amine ampliﬁcation and (b) hydrophobicity on the performance of CO2 separation at room\\ntemperature and atmospheric pressure. The increased hydrophobicity on the amine-ampliﬁed interface played an important role in\\nimproving the CO2 uptake from 24 mmol/L (water contact angle (WCA) of 86°) to 63 mmol/L (WCA of 151°). However,\\nsuperhydrophobic coating that lacked the amine ampliﬁcation process displayed a poor (7 mmol/L) CO2 separation performance.\\nThus, controlled amalgamation of amine ampliﬁcation and bioinspired superhydrophobicity in ﬁbrous cotton lead to a synergistic\\nimpact towards eﬃcient CO2 separation at ambient temperature and pressure, irrespective of the level of humidity present during the\\ncourse of the experiments.

The number of water\\nmolecules and the number of protons involved in diﬀerent\\ncases mentioned above are summarized in Table 1.\\nIn case (i), which involves CO2-3A1P without any explicit\\nwater molecules, the reaction proceeds in two steps, as depicted\\nin Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The distance between the carbon of CO2\\nand nitrogen of 3A1P in the reactant complex (RC) is 2.86 Å.\\nThis suggests a weak interaction between the two reactant\\nspecies. However, there is a strong interaction between the\\nproton of the hydroxy group and the nitrogen of 3A1P that gets\\ndecreased due to the interaction of CO2 with 3A1P. The binding\\nof CO2 with the nitrogen atom forms a protonated carbamate\\nion intermediate (IM). As a result, the C–N internuclear\\ndistance is reduced to 1.62 Å. The energy of the IM is\\n6.9 kcal mol\\x031 higher than that of the RC, suggesting that\\nthe formation of an intermediate is not favoured without the\\ninvolvement of water molecules. This is consistent with\\nthe results of Said et al., where it is reported that the 1,3-\\nzwitterion formation via a four-membered transition state is\\nunfavorable.27 The next step involves the formation of carbamic\\nacid via proton transfer. The proton of the amino group is\\ntransferred to the hydroxy group, and the proton of the hydroxy\\ngroup is transferred to the carboxylate group in a concerted way\\nthrough a six-membered transition state TS2, as shown in Fig.\\nS1 of the ESI.† The product complex (PC) is ultimately formed\\nfrom the transition state TS2. The energy barrier for the proton\\ntransfer is 10.7 kcal mol\\x031, which is the rate-determining step\\nof the reaction.\\nAlthough the above study was carried out in an aqueous\\nenvironment using the implicit solvent model, the water mole-\\ncule was not explicitly present.

The involvement of the hydroxy\\ngroup depends on the orientation of water molecules around\\n3A1P in the RC. In case (ii), the C–N distance of 2.68 Å of RC is\\nreduced to 1.59 Å on forming an IM (Fig. S3, ESI†). The\\nrelatively less energy difference between the RC and IM of\\nthe above, compared to that of case (i) can be attributed to\\nthe formation of a six-membered cyclic transition state TS1. In\\nthe rate-determining step of case (ii), two protons are trans-\\nferred. The transition state for the formation of carbamic acid\\nis depicted as TS2 in Fig. S3 of the ESI.† From the transition\\nstate structure, it is evident that the extra proton in the amine\\ngroup of the protonated carbamate ion intermediate is trans-\\nferred to the oxygen atom of the water molecule. Subsequently,\\nthe proton of the water molecule is transferred to the oxygen\\natom of the carboxylate group in a concerted manner.\\nThe Gibbs free energy of activation for the rate-determining\\nstep of case (ii) is found to be 9.1 kcal mol\\x031, which is less than\\nthat observed for case (i). Thus, it can be inferred that the\\nparticipation of water molecules makes the proton transfer\\nmore feasible.\\nIn the RC of case (iii), the proton of the hydroxy group of\\n3A1P interacts with the water molecule, as depicted in Fig. S4\\n(ESI†). After the absorption of CO2, the distance between C and\\nN is reduced from 2.85 Å to 1.59 Å. In the next step, the proton\\nthat binds to the nitrogen atom is transferred to oxygen of the\\nhydroxy group. Subsequently, the proton of the hydroxy group\\nis transferred to the oxygen atom of the water molecule. This is\\nfollowed by shifting of the proton of the water molecule\\ntowards the carboxylate group, forming a product complex.\\nThe Gibbs free energy of activation for the rate-determining\\nstep is 7.4 kcal mol\\x031, which is less compared to those of\\nprevious two cases. This suggests that apart from the water\\nmolecule, the involvement of the hydroxy group also facilitates\\nthe proton transfer.\\nTwo cases are studied for the proton transfer involving two\\nwater molecules.

The\\nmechanism and the energy profiles of case (iv) are depicted in\\nFig. S5 (ESI†) and of case (v) are provided in Fig. 2.\\nIn case (iv), the distance between the nitrogen atom of 3A1P\\nand the carbon atom of CO2 is reduced from 2.66 Å to 1.59 Å,\\nwhen the reactants are converted to the intermediate. In the\\nnext step, the above intermediate is converted to a product\\ncomplex via the transition state TS2. During this transition, the\\nadditional proton residing on the nitrogen atom of the carba-\\nmate ion intermediate (IM) shifts to the oxygen atom of the first\\nwater molecule. This is accompanied by the transfer of one of\\nthe hydrogens of the first water molecule to the oxygen atom of\\nthe second water molecule. Concurrently, one of the hydrogens\\nof the second water molecule is transferred to the oxygen atom\\nof the carboxylate group in a concerted manner. The Gibbs free\\nenergy of activation for the above step is 7.4 kcal mol\\x031, which\\nis the rate-determining step.\\nAs mentioned earlier, for case (v), the hydroxy group along\\nwith two water molecules participate in the proton transfer. The\\nmechanism of the above reaction consists of three steps. In the\\nfirst step, CO2 is absorbed by nitrogen of 3A1P forming IM1. In\\nthe second step, IM1 is converted to IM2, during which the N–C\\nbond distance is reduced from 1.62 Å to 1.57 Å. During this\\ntransition, one of the water molecules that interacts with the\\noxygen atom of the hydroxy group is rotated. As a result, the\\ninteraction of this water molecule with the hydroxy group is\\nreduced. Subsequently, the intramolecular interaction between\\nthe –NH and –OH groups is enhanced, which is confirmed by the\\nbond critical point analysis. In the next step of the reaction, IM2\\nis converted to a product complex via the transition state TS3.\\nTable 2\\nNatural bond orbital analysis of the transition states involving the proton transfer\\nCase\\nTransition state\\nNBO donor\\nNBO acceptor\\nDE(2)\\nij (kcal mol\\x031)\\n(i)\\nLP (N12)\\ns* (O10H13)\\n139\\nLP (O17)\\ns* (O10H11)\\n123\\n(ii)\\nLP (N12)\\ns* (O18H14)\\n137\\nLP (O17)\\ns* (O18H19)\\n144\\n(iii)\\nLP (N12)\\ns* (O10H13)\\n98\\nLP (O16)\\ns* (O18H20)\\n83\\nLP (O18)\\ns* (O10H11)\\n109\\n(iv)\\nLP (N12)\\ns* (O21H14)\\n125\\nLP (O17)\\ns* (O18H19)\\n103\\nLP (O18)\\ns* (O21H23)\\n145\\ns* (O21H14)\\ns* (O21H23)\\n13\\ns (O18H19)\\ns* (O21H23)\\n14\\n(v)\\nLP (N11)\\ns* (O10H13)\\n65\\nLP (O16)\\ns* (O18H17)\\n83\\nLP (O18)\\ns* (O21H19)\\n79\\nLP (O21)\\ns* (O10H23)\\n187\\ns (O21H19)\\ns* (O10H23)\\n19\\nPCCP\\nPaper\\nPublished on 01 July 2024.

In this process, the proton of the amine group is\\ntransferred to the oxygen atom of the hydroxy group, and the\\nproton of the hydroxy group relocates to the oxygen atom of the\\nfirst water molecule, followed by the transfer of its hydrogen atom\\nto oxygen of the second water molecule. Simultaneously, one of\\nthe hydrogen atoms of the second water molecule is shifted\\ntoward the carboxylate group.

From the change in Gibbs\\nfree energy value associated with the proton transfer for all the\\nabove cases (Table 1), it is concluded that among the proton\\ntransfer mechanisms, the one involving four protons is energeti-\\ncally the most favorable for CO2 absorption.\\nThe transition state corresponding to the proton transfer for\\nall the cases is further investigated using the NBO analysis.

Phys., 2024, 26, 19845–19853 |  19851\\nthere are two major interactions present in case (i) i.e. LP\\n(N12) - s* (O10H13) and LP(O17) - s* (O10H11) with inter-\\naction energies of 139 kcal mol\\x031 and 123 kcal mol\\x031, respec-\\ntively. The interaction LP (N12) - s* (O10H13) leads to the\\ntransfer of the lone pair of electrons of the nitrogen atom to the\\nantibonding orbital of the O10H13 bond, leading to its elonga-\\ntion, suggesting less favorable transfer of H13 from N12 to O10.\\nOn the other hand, in the interaction LP(O17) - s* (O10H11),\\nthe lone pair electrons of O17 are transferred to the antibonding\\norbital of the O10H11 bond, leading to the lengthening of the\\nO10H11 bond, thereby favoring the transfer of H11 to O17. Out of\\nthese two interactions, the former is favored, and the latter one\\nis less favored resulting in a relatively high energy barrier for\\nthe proton transfer. A similar observation is also made for case\\n(ii), for which the favorable interaction is relatively even stron-\\nger than that in case (i). From the table, we can see that more\\nsuch favorable interactions are present for the cases in which\\nthe number of protons transferred is more (case (iii) to case (v)).\\nMore details about these interactions are provided in Table S1\\nof the ESI.† The presence of more numbers of such favorable\\ninteractions as we move from case (i) to case (v) supports\\nthe consistent lowering of the energy barrier for the proton\\ntransfer.\\nTo gain more insights into the energetics of various species,\\nbond critical point (BCP) analysis that provides the topological\\nfeatures of electron density for the species involved in the\\nreaction has been carried out. For this purpose, the electron\\ndensity (r) and Laplacian of electron density (r2(r)) at bond\\ncritical points are determined as mentioned earlier. The values\\nof r and r2(r) at the relevant (3,\\x031) bond critical points for the\\nspecies involved in the proton transfer of CO2-3A1P are pro-\\nvided in Table 3. For other systems, the above values are given\\nin Table S2 of the ESI.†\\nIt can be seen that the energy diﬀerence between the species\\ninvolved in a reaction (reactant complex, transition states,\\nintermediates, etc.) can be correlated with the change in\\nelectron density at diﬀerent bond critical points of those\\nspecies. For example, in Table 3, as we move from RC to TS1,\\nit can be seen that the CO2 interaction with the amino group is\\nincreased, as reflected from the increase in the electron density\\nat the critical point 1 (N–CCO2) from 0.012 a.u. to 0.063 a.u.\\nHowever, the electron density at the HOH–N bond critical point\\nin the RC disappears on forming TS1, although a marginal\\nelectron density is developed between HN–OOH for TS1. Thus,\\nthe higher energy of TS1 can be attributed to the disappearance\\nof the strong interaction between the lone pair electrons of\\nnitrogen and the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group. In IM1, the\\nstabilization is due to the increased electron density at critical\\npoint 1 (N–CCO2) from 0.063 a.u. to 0.185 a.u. Compared to the\\nenergy of IM1, that of TS2 is increased and can be attributed\\nmainly to the decrement of the electron density at (3,\\x031) bond\\ncritical points HOH–OOH and HN–N inducing the proton trans-\\nfer. Finally, the energy is significantly reduced with the for-\\nmation of PC due to the bond formation between N–CCO2, OCO2–\\nHCO2 and OOH–HOH as evident from the electron density and the\\nrespective Laplacian of electron densities. A similar analysis\\nholds true for other systems as evident from Table S2 of\\nthe ESI.†\\nTo know the eﬀect of the basis set on the free energy barrier\\nfor the proton transfer, single point energy calculations were\\ncarried out at the M06-2X/cc-pVTZ level. The thermal correction\\nto the electronic energy and the optimized geometries for this\\npurpose were taken from the results obtained at the M06-2X/cc-\\npVDZ level. The energy profiles for various cases of the reaction\\nare provided in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1–S5 of the ESI.† From the\\nanalysis, it was found that the energy barrier for the proton\\ntransfer decreases with the number of water molecules, irre-\\nspective of the basis sets used.\\nIn addition, the eﬀect of the functional on the energetics of\\nthe reaction is also examined using Grimme’s D3BJ dispersion-\\ncorrected double hybrid functional B2PLYP-D3 with the cc-\\npVTZ basis set.37,38 The thermal correction to the electronic\\nenergy and the optimized geometries for this purpose were\\ntaken from the results obtained at the M06-2X/cc-pVDZ level, as\\nwas done above. The results of these calculations are also\\nincorporated in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1–S5 (ESI†). It is observed\\nthat the conclusion drawn on the barrier of the reaction\\nto the number of water molecules did not change with the\\nfunctional used.\\n4. Conclusion\\nThe eﬀect of water molecules and the hydroxy group of alka-\\nnolamine in the process of CO2 absorption via aqueous 3-\\namino-1-propanol is investigated. Five reaction paths have been\\nanalyzed according to the spatial arrangement of constituent\\nmolecules. The spatial orientation of the water molecules, as\\nwell as the number of water molecules involved in the reaction\\ncomplex during the reaction, determine the mechanistic paths.\\nThe availability of a hydroxy group in the periphery of the\\nalkanolamine–water complex significantly impacts the ener-\\ngetics of the formation of carbamic acid. The proton abstrac-\\ntion from the protonated carbamate ion is an essential step in\\nthe reaction between CO2 and 3A1P.

The main drawback of the carbon\\ncapture processes is the required energy to regenerate the solvent once it\\nhas reacted with the CO2.

Several solvents, i.e., monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine\\n(DEA), methyl diethanolamine (MDEA), and many others have been\\nproposed to overcome this drawback. Regeneration temperature and heat\\nduty reduction are considered to be the signiﬁcant objectives. Moreover,\\nenhancement of the amine’s concentration and its working capacity\\nwithout the impact on the other variables are important. In this work,\\ndiﬀerent types of amines with a wide range of heat duty and regeneration\\ntemperatures under the same set of assumptions are calculated and\\ncompared. The eﬀect of both variables on the energy penalty caused by carbon capture is measured. A review of amines and their\\neﬀects on the net eﬃciency of the overall system (power plant, chemical absorption, CO2 compression) are conducted and analyzed.\\nAs expected, the impact of heat duty is greater than the modiﬁcation of regeneration temperature.

        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: Aqueous tertiary amine solutions are increasingly\\nused in industrial CO2 capture operations because they are more\\nenergy-eﬃcient than primary or secondary amines and demon-\\nstrate higher CO2 absorption capacity. Yet, tertiary amine solutions\\nhave a signiﬁcant drawback in that they tend to have lower CO2\\nabsorption rates. To identify tertiary amines that absorb CO2\\nfaster, it would be eﬃcacious to have a quantitative and predictive\\nmodel of the rate-controlling processes. Despite numerous\\nattempts to date, this goal has been elusive. The present\\ncomputational approach achieves this goal by focusing on the\\nreaction of CO2 with OH−forming HCO3\\n−. The performance of\\nthe resulting model is demonstrated for a consistent experimental\\ndata set of the absorption rates of CO2 for 24 diﬀerent aqueous\\ntertiary amine solvents. The key to the new model’s success is the manner in which the free energy barrier for the reaction of CO2\\nwith OH−is evaluated from the diﬀerences among the solvation free energies of CO2, OH−, and HCO3\\n−, while the pKa of the\\namines controls the concentration of OH−. These solvation energies are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. The\\nexperimental value of the free energy of reaction of CO2 with pure water is combined with information about measured rates of\\nabsorption of CO2 in an aqueous amine solvent in order to calibrate the absorption rate model. This model achieves a relative\\naccuracy better than 0.1 kJ mol−1 for the free energies of activation for CO2 absorption in aqueous amine solutions and 0.07 g L−1\\nmin−1 for the absorption rate of CO2. Such high accuracies are necessary to predict the correct experimental ranking of CO2\\nabsorption rates, thus providing a quantitative approach of practical interest.'"

        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: Reactive carbon capture (RCC) is a promising\\nsolution for carbon capture and utilization. RCC involves CO2\\ncapture, typically with amine solutions to form carbamate, followed\\nby immediate conversion into value-added chemicals and fuels,\\ntypically via electrochemical means. RCC may enhance CO2\\nreduction (CO2R) by overcoming the inherent limiting low\\nsolubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions. In this work, we present\\na systematic study of the influence of monoethanolamine (MEA)\\non CO2R performance over an Ag cathode in KHCO3 electrolytes.\\nContrary to prior work, the study finds no evidence for the direct\\nreduction of carbamate anions. Instead, the presence of MEA\\nsuppresses the rate of CO formation while increasing that of H2.\\nThese results are supported by a boundary-layer continuum model\\nof mass transport and reaction that correctly predicts experimental trends and demonstrates that MEA reduces the\\nconcentration of CO2 near the cathode. Thus, alternative strategies are necessary to achieve RCC in aqueous environments.\\nC\\narbon capture and utilization by means of electro-\\nchemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to fuels and\\nchemicals offer an attractive approach for reutilizing\\nthe carbon content in CO2 released from stationary sources or\\ncaptured from the atmosphere.1−4 One of the serious\\nlimitations of CO2R in aqueous solutions is the solubility of\\nCO2, which is ∼34 mM for 1 atm of gaseous CO2 or even\\nlower in an electrolyte due to salting out.5,6 The low solubility\\nof CO2 combined with its low diffusion coefficient means that\\nCO2R becomes mass-transfer-limited at even low current\\ndensities (>10 mA/cm2) in aqueous electrolyzers.7−9 This\\nlimitation has led researchers to consider reactive carbon\\ncapture (RCC) as an alternative, where the addition of a\\ncarbon-capture agent to the electrolyte produces an adduct\\nthat can achieve higher concentrations than dissolved\\nCO2\\n10−17 and, ideally, the adduct would be amenable to\\nelectrochemical reduction at similar or enhanced rates\\ncompared to dissolved CO2.\\nSeveral recent studies have suggested that RCC could be\\nachieved by adding an amine to form a carbamate via18,19\\n+\\n+\\n+\\nH Ioo\\nCO\\n2RNH\\nRNHCOO\\nRNH\\nK\\n2\\n2\\n3\\nC\\n(1)\\nWhile the capture agent increases the total concentration of\\ndissolved carbonaceous species, the question remains whether\\nthe resulting carbamate (RNHCOO−) can be directly reduced\\nto products.

Chen et al. first reported CO2R over planar metal\\nelectrodes from an industrial, 30 wt % monoethanolamine\\n(MEA) capture solution, noting that the carbamate and\\nammonium (RNH3\\n+) ions act as a supporting electrolyte.15\\nThe CO2R performance from the capture medium was\\nenhanced with a porous electrode and the addition of a\\ncationic surfactant, but the authors note that it is likely only\\naqueous CO2 participates in reduction.

Silver foil (99.998%, 0.1 mm thick, Thermo Fisher\\nScientific) was used as the cathode, which was mechanically\\npolished (400 grit), thoroughly rinsed in deionized (DI) water,\\nand sonicated in acetone (≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) prior to\\neach experiment.24 The anode was a platinum mesh (99.995%,\\nSigma-Aldrich). The working electrode and counter electrode\\nhad geometric areas of 0.5 and 2 cm2, respectively (Figure S1).\\nFor the three-electrode configuration, a Ag/AgCl reference\\nelectrode (filled with 3.4 M KCl, Leak-Free, Innovative\\nInstruments) was used. The potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3,\\n99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich) and monoethanolamine (MEA,\\n≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) electrolyte solutions were prepared\\nwith Milli-Q water and pretreated with a chelating agent\\n(Chelex 100, Na form, 50−100 mesh (dry), Sigma-Aldrich) to\\neliminate metallic impurities.\\nThe catholyte was saturated with CO2 (25 sccm, 99.999%,\\nAirgas) for 1.5 h in a reservoir before each experiment, then\\ncirculated through the compression cell at a rate of 80 mL/min\\nusing a peristaltic pump while continuously sparging CO2 into\\nthe solution. Electrochemical chronoamperometry experiments\\nwere conducted using a potentiostat (BioLogic VSP-300). The\\nuncompensated resistance was determined by the current\\ninterrupt method and was compensated to 85% with the\\npotentiostat.25 To analyze the CO2 reduction products, an\\nonline gas chromatograph (multiple gas analyzer #5, SRI\\nInstruments) equipped with both Hayesep D and Molsieve 5A\\ncolumns and both thermal-conductivity and flame-ionization\\ndetectors was employed.\\nThe equilibrium distribution of species in the KHCO3-\\nMEA-CO2 electrolyte was calculated assuming equilibration\\nwith a reservoir of gaseous CO2 at a partial pressure of 1 atm. A\\nsystem of equations consisting of seven equilibrium reactions,\\none mass balance (conservation of MEA and its derivatives),\\nand one charge balance (electroneutrality) was solved in\\nMATLAB to determine the concentration of the nine reacting\\nspecies (see Supporting Information section S2 for details and\\nrelevant constants provided in Tables S1 and S2). The activity\\nof ions was calculated using the Davies equation, and while this\\napproach does not consider ion-specific interactions, it is\\nsuperior to neglecting the effect of ionic strength on the\\nactivity of charged species. The activity of aqueous CO2 is\\ngiven by the Weisenberger−Schumpe model,5 and the activity\\nof water is assumed to be unity for all electrolyte\\nconcentrations.\\nA one-dimensional model (solved in COMSOL Multi-\\nphysics 6.1) was used to predict concentration profiles for nine\\nspecies present in the mass-transfer boundary layer. It was\\nassumed that beyond the boundary layer the species’\\nconcentrations are governed by the bulk solution thermody-\\nnamics.7 A diagram of the modeled system is depicted in\\nFigure S3; details of the model are given in section S3 of the\\nSupporting Information, and relevant kinetic and diffusion\\nconstants are provided in Tables S3−S5. Electrode reactions\\nare assumed to follow concentration-dependent Tafel kinetics.\\nFor an electrochemical system subject to significant mass-\\ntransport limitations, kinetic parameters (exchange current\\ndensity, transfer coefficient, and boundary-layer thickness) are\\nobtained by a least-squares fit to the data using the BOBYQA\\nalgorithm, an approach similar to that described by Corpus et\\nal.26 Further details of the parameter-determination procedure\\nare shown in Figures S4−S6.\\nFigure 1 shows that the addition of MEA to 0.1 M KHCO3\\nhas a significant impact on the partial current densities (PCDs)\\nof H2 and CO. The H2 PCD increases with an increasing MEA\\nconcentration (Figure 1a), whereas the CO PCD decreases\\n(Figure 1b). These changes can be partially attributed to the\\nincrease in bulk HCO3\\n−concentration resulting from the\\npresence of MEA (see Table 1), since HCO3\\n−is known to act\\nas a proton donor for hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER)\\nbecause it has a lower pKa than H2O.27−29 However, Table 1\\nalso shows that addition of MEA to 1.0 M KHCO3 does not\\nchange the HCO3\\n−concentration; this solution still shows an\\nincrease in H2 PCD upon the addition of MEA (Figure 2a).\\nThis observation suggests that monoethanolammonium\\n(MEAH+), which is present in substantial concentrations in\\nthe bulk electrolyte, can act as a tertiary proton source for\\nhydrogen evolution in an alkaline electrolyte. This reasoning is\\nsupported by the recognition that the pKa of MEAH+ is 9.44,\\nwhich is lower than that of water (14.0) and HCO3\\n−(10.3).\\nHence, MEAH+ can serve as an effective proton donor at\\nconcentrations that are significantly lower than those of water\\nand HCO3\\n−. This interpretation is supported by our\\nsimulation discussed below.\\nThe CO PCD in MEA-containing electrolyte never exceeds\\nthat obtained from an MEA-free electrolyte, strongly\\nsuggesting that direct carbamate reduction does not occur\\n(Figures 1b, 2b, and S2b). If this CO-evolution reaction\\n(COER) pathway were possible, we would expect a greater\\nrate of CO production from the MEA-containing electrolyte,\\ncorresponding to a higher effective concentration of reducible,\\ncarbon-containing species. This result holds for the case of 1.0\\nM KHCO3 electrolyte with 0.2 M MEA additive, which\\ncontains carbamate anions at a concentration 4.4 times that of\\nfree CO2 dissolved in the bulk (Table 1, Figure 2b). What we\\nACS Energy Letters\\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/journal/aelccp\\nLetter\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.3c01953\\nACS Energy Lett. 2023, 8, 5012−5017\\n5013\\nobserve instead is a significant reduction in CO PCD in MEA-\\ncontaining electrolyte. While it is possible that MEA and its\\nderivatives affect the electrochemical double layer or strongly\\nadsorb to the silver cathode, thereby inhibiting CO evolution,\\nwe hypothesize, instead, that MEA affects the solution\\nchemistry near the cathode, reducing the local CO2\\nconcentration and CO PCD as a result. To support this\\nhypothesis, we examined the effects of chemical transport and\\nreaction in the mass-transfer boundary layer near the cathode\\nusing a 1D continuum model.\\nFigure 3 shows that the 1D continuum model correctly\\npredicts the H2 and CO PCDs observed with 0.1 M KHCO3\\nwith 0, 0.1, and 0.2 M concentrations of MEA. Similar results\\nfor the 1.0 M KHCO3 electrolyte with MEA are presented in\\nFigure S8.

Inclusion of these processes provides\\na reasonably good description of the effect of low\\nconcentrations of MEA on the rate of CO formation in\\nKHCO3 solutions. The enhanced production of H2 by MEA is\\npredicted by the model and is consistent with the two\\narguments discussed previously: (1) MEA elevates the\\nconcentration of HCO3\\n−and associated HCO3\\n−-derived\\nHER rate and (2) MEAH+ is directly reduced to H2.\\nFurthermore, the model fails to correctly describe the H2\\nPCD when eq 2 is not incorporated (Figure S7). To\\nunderstand how MEA suppresses the production of CO, it is\\ninstructive to examine the species concentration profiles within\\nthe mass-transfer boundary layer, which are shown in Figure 4.\\nThe model provides insight into the suppression of the CO\\nPCD when MEA is added to the electrolyte. Specifically, it\\npredicts a lower concentration of dissolved CO2 in the\\nboundary layer for a given cathode potential when MEA is\\npresent, thereby explaining the reduction in the CO evolution\\nrate observed experimentally given that CO evolution is well-\\nmodeled by concentration-dependent Tafel kinetics (Figure\\n4a). In MEA-free electrolyte, the decrease in CO2 concen-\\ntration relative to its bulk concentration is well-known to occur\\nthrough a combination of CO2 reduction at the cathode and\\nhomogeneous reaction with OH−anions, generated by HER\\nand COER, with dissolved CO2.7 In the MEA-containing\\nelectrolyte, CO2 is further depleted by reaction with MEA\\nreleased near the cathode, resulting in the formation of\\ncarbamate anions; Figure 4b shows that the concentration of\\nMEA and carbamate anions in the boundary layer is higher\\nthan in the bulk electrolyte. Two pathways contribute to the\\nlocal generation of MEA: (1) the electrochemical reduction of\\nMEAH+ to H2 and (2) the dissociation of MEAH+ due to the\\nhigh local pH. Deprotonation of MEAH+ occurs before that of\\nHCO3\\n−because it is relatively acidic (the pKa of MEAH+ is\\n9.44 while that of HCO3\\n−is 10.3). Once again, it is important\\nto note that despite a high concentration of carbamate anions\\nat the cathode surface (57.2 mM, which exceeds the bulk\\nconcentration of CO2), the CO PCD for the 0.1 M KHCO3\\nMEA-containing electrolyte is much lower than that for MEA-\\nfree electrolyte (4.41 versus 13.0 mA/cm2 at an applied\\npotential of −1.5 V vs SHE). These observations strongly\\nsupport the conclusion that carbamate anions do not undergo\\nreduction.\\nIn addition to demonstrating that direct carbamate anions\\ndo not undergo reduction, our analysis finds no evidence that\\nelevated bulk concentrations of soluble carbon in the form of\\nFigure 3.

To explain the differences in H2 and CO\\nevolution rates for each amine-electrolyte, Table S6 contains\\nthe predicted bulk composition with comparison to the base-\\ncase MEA. In all cases the CO PCD is lower in the presence of\\nthe CO2 capture agent than in its absence. We acknowledge\\nthat these simulations ignore the possibility of direct carbamate\\nreduction and that further experimental work or theoretical\\ncalculations may suggest that a non-MEA carbamate is\\namenable to such a reaction pathway. However, the reduction\\nof the ammonium species to H2 negatively affects the CO\\nFaradaic efficiency, making this approach unattractive even\\nwith potential carbamate reduction.\\nOur systematic study of the effect of MEA addition to an\\naqueous electrolyte on the electrochemical reduction of CO2\\nreveals no evidence for direct reduction of carbamate anions\\nformed by the reaction of CO2 with MEA or for carbamate\\nanions serving as reservoir of CO2. In fact, MEA addition\\nresults in a high bulk concentration of MEAH+, a species that\\nsimultaneously increases H2 PCD and contributes to reduction\\nof the CO PCD. A continuum model developed to interpret\\nthe experimental observations correctly describes the observed\\neffects of MEA addition. The model confirms that MEAH+ acts\\nas a proton source for hydrogen evolution and that MEA\\nreduces the local CO2 concentration and consequently the CO\\nPCD. Therefore, it is our recommendation that continued\\nresearch into CO2R considers only the reduction of CO2 after\\nthermal desorption from the amine-based adsorbate solution as\\nopposed to in its captured state.\\n■ASSOCIATED CONTENT\\n*\\nsı Supporting Information\\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at\\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.3c01953.\\nMaterials and methods, additional experimental data,\\nand tabulated constants (PDF)\\n■AUTHOR INFORMATION\\nCorresponding Author\\nAlexis T.

        "Abstract": "'Abstract\\nProton transfer in water-based environments occurs because of hydrogen-bond\\ninteraction. There are many interesting physicochemical phenomena in this field,\\ncausing fast structural diffusion of hydronium and hydroxide ions. During the last\\nfew decades, to support experimental observations and measurements, quantum-\\nmechanical molecular dynamics (QMMD) simulations with reasonable accuracy\\nand efficiency have significantly unraveled structural, energetic, and dynamical\\nproperties of excess proton in aqueous environments. This review summarizes the\\nstate-of-the-art QMMD studies of proton transfer processes in aqueous solutions\\nand complex systems including bulk liquid water, ice phases, and confined water\\nin nanochannel/nanoporous materials as well as reports on CO2 scrubbing by\\namine-based chemical absorption.\\nThis article is categorized under:\\nStructure and Mechanism > Reaction Mechanisms and Catalysis\\nMolecular and Statistical Mechanics > Molecular Dynamics and Monte-Carlo\\nMethods\\nElectronic Structure Theory > Semiempirical Electronic Structure Methods\\nTheoretical and Physical Chemistry > Reaction Dynamics and Kinetics\\nK E Y W O R D S\\ndensity functional tight binding method, divide and conquer method, hydrogen bond, proton transfer,\\nquantum-mechanical molecular dynamics\\n1\\nmechanism.254 The explicit inclusion of OH−in the system has led to the abstraction of the prevailing proton by the anion\\ninstead of the solvent water molecules. This observation arises from two factors: the stronger proton acceptor of negatively\\ncharged species and the increased probability of establishing a close contact with CO2 in favor of the structural diffusivity of\\nOH−. Sakti et al.254 have further estimated rate constants of the zwitterion formation reaction by fitting time-course changes\\nof chemical species to the kinetic model. Their analysis showed a reaction rate of zwitterion deprotonation slower than that of\\nformation; this may be interpreted as the importance of OH−ion concentration for producing more CO2 absorbed compound\\n(carbamate ion).\\nThe bicarbonate ion is another chemical product formed during the CO2 capture process.258,259 The AIMD simulations\\nhave not extensively targeted the bicarbonate formation reaction in an aqueous system.250,256,258,260,261 Nakai et al.250 have\\ngained molecular insights from structural and electronic analyses that the Grotthuss-type diffusion of the OH−ion plays the\\nkey role in CO2 interaction. They have also observed various chemical reactions involving the PT process during the sampling\\nof 100 trajectories and further illustrated the direct PT mechanism in the CO2 regeneration process. The PT process can be\\nconsidered to dominate the major part of the chemical absorption in CCS.\\nThe theoretical estimation of acidity (pKa) of the protonated amine serve as an important research area related to CCS.233\\nThe AIMD simulations262–265 have contributed to compute pKa values of acid molecules by considering the explicit solution\\nenvironment and the temperature effect with the help of the metadynamics sampling technique.266–268 Recently, the excellent\\nperformance of the DFTB-based metadynamics approach has been verified for the calculation of pKa values of amines.269 The\\ncomparison with more than 30 experimental data270–273 has resulted in the mean absolute deviation of 0.09 pKa units\\n(Table 3) and correlation coefficient of 0.990. By using the established protocol, new candidates for the CO2 absorption pro-\\ncess can be explored.\\n6\\n| CONCLUSION\\nRecent theoretical studies on PT in various water environments have highlighted the importance of the theoretical develop-\\nment for describing the water systems. Despite some theoretical issues and limitations, qualitative and quantitative properties\\nassociated with the PT process have been successfully evaluated and are found to be comparable with the experimental evi-\\ndence. Along with more developed theoretical methods, the reason for OH−diffusion to be slower than that of H3O+ in bulk\\nliquid water has been revealed100 and complemented the pre-solvation scenarios explained by AIMD simulations at the GGAs\\nand DFTB levels.10,112,113 While the accuracy of the DFT-based MD simulations depend on the choice of functional and the\\nsize of basis set, the DFTB methods relies on the performance of the parameter set. As previously examined by Choi et al.,129\\nSAKTI ET AL.\\n9 of 20\\nthe extension of the second-order to the third-order DFTB did not significantly improve the structure and dynamics of PT in\\nliquid water. In fact, it was also found that the former one has better description of PT dynamics. Incorporating the diffusion\\ncorrection in the MD simulation has not been confirmed to improve the structure and dynamics of H3O+ and OH−ions in liq-\\nuid water. Therefore, more thorough benchmark simulations at the DFTB level will be valuable assets for further improvement\\non the computational methodology.\\nAt a low-temperature regime, in spite of high translational and rotational barriers that prevent vehicular diffusion, proton\\ndiffusivity is not negligible. The computer simulations have provided a theoretical evidence of faster diffusivity in the ice\\nphase than that in bulk liquid water,176 though occasionally the PT process is suppressed by the formation of a H3O+ ion with\\nlong shelf life. Moreover, fast proton diffusivity can be observed in a confined water environment created inside the\\nnanochannel or porous materials. In such a confined water structure, once a charge defect is created, the proton diffusivity can\\nbe accelerated up to 18 times faster than that in liquid water.221 H3O+ ion formation and water mobility are likely to be con-\\ntrolled by temperature, chemical environment related to hydrophobicity, and size of the nanoporous materials.222 Furthermore,\\nthe PT process is essential in the chemical absorption and regeneration processes of the CCS technology.

        "Abstract": "'A B S T R A C T\\nIn industrial post-carbon capture processes, monoethanolamine (MEA) has been mainly used as an absorption\\nsolvent. However, this approach generates signiﬁcant amounts of toxic wastewater containing a heavy chemical\\ndiﬃcult to treat and also raises concerns about acute corrosion of metal structures in the facility. To reduce the\\nuse of MEA in carbon capture, this work evaluates the catalytic performance of nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs) for\\nCO2 capture as a possible additive in an MEA solvent. We test the CO2 absorption rate in MEA catalyzed by\\nNiNPs in both limited and high mixing conditions to model real capturing processes in the packed column of\\nindustrial absorption reactors. For this purpose, a microreactor and a long serpentine microchannel are em-\\nployed. The catalytic absorption performance of NiNPs for CO2 in aqueous MEA is evaluated using CO2 mi-\\ncrobubbles by monitoring changes in size upon their time-dependent absorption. We ﬁnd that the average CO2\\nabsorption rate with NiNPs is accelerated by 34% in the limited mixing condition in the microreactor. This\\nincrease is mainly due to NPs’ catalytic CO2 absorption driven by a Brownian motion. On the other hand, in the\\nhigh mixing condition in the long serpentine microchannel, the catalytic activity of NiNPs improves the average\\nCO2 absorption rate further to 54%. This improvement makes it possible to shorten the timescale for reaching\\nCO2 absorption equilibrium and therefore to reduce the size of the reactors signiﬁcantly. The test results de-\\nmonstrate that NiNPs serve as suitable additives in the MEA-based CO2 absorption system.'"

To this end, we synthesized\\npoly(N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] methacrylamide) (pDMAP-\\nMAm) by free radical polymerization and tested its ability to\\nbehave as a CO2-responsive polymer in a transducer. The electrical\\nresponse of this polymer to CO2 upon long exposure times was\\nmeasured in both the aqueous and solid phases. Direct current\\nresistance measurement tests on pDMAPMAm ﬁlms printed along\\nwith the silver electrodes in the presence of CO2 at various\\nconcentrations reveal a two-region electrical response. Upon continuous exposure to diﬀerent CO2 ﬂow rates (at a constant pressure\\nof 0.2 MPa), the resistance ﬁrst decreased over time, reaching a minimum, followed by a gradual increase with further exposure to\\nCO2. A similar trend is observed when CO2 is introduced to an aqueous solution of pDMAPMAm. The in situ monitoring of pH\\nsuggests that the change in resistance of pDMAPMAm can be attributed to the protonation of tertiary amine groups in the presence\\nof CO2. This two-region response of pDMAPMAm is based on a proton-hopping mechanism and a change in the number of free\\namines when pDMAPMAm is exposed to various levels of CO2.'"

The results reveal that the aqueous\\nMEA solution containing CO2 creates a favorable environment for the corrosion of both stainless\\nsteels. The rate of corrosion is accelerated when the temperature of the loaded MEA solution rises,\\nwhich was attributed to the thermal degradation of the loaded MEA, thus causing higher kinetics of\\nthe cathodic reactions at higher temperatures. More speciﬁcally, for the SS 304L the corrosion rate is\\nalmost doubled when the solution temperature is increased from 25 ◦C to 40 ◦C and is quadrupled\\nwhen the solution temperature rises to 80 ◦C. For the SS 316L, the corrosion rate becomes almost\\nthreefold and sixfold upon increasing temperature of the load amine solution to 40 ◦C and 80 ◦C,\\nrespectively. The overall corrosion rate of SS 316L is lower with respect to the SS 304L for the same\\ntemperature and loading conditions. The essential dependency of corrosion rate on solution type\\n(unloaded and loaded MEA solution) demonstrates that the corrosion process and reactions are\\ncontrolled by a diffusion mechanism.\\nKeywords: CO2 capture; stainless steel; monoethanolamine (MEA); corrosion; microstructure'"

        "Abstract": "'A B S T R A C T   \\nCombined cycle gas turbine power plants (CCGTs) are a combined cycle consisting of a gas turbine and a steam \\nturbine to generate electricity. Sometimes CCGTs incorporate cogeneration to produce both heat and power. \\nAfter the gas fuel combustion in the gas turbine combustion chamber, the flue gases are passed through the Heat \\nRecovery Steam Generator (HRSG) to extract heat and generate additional electrical power using the steam \\nturbine. The CCGT technology is recognized for its highest efficiency of 58% in electricity production among the \\npower production technology. A highly efficient CCGT power plant with 60% efficiency produces even 2.5 times \\nless CO2 than a modern coal power plant with an efficiency of 45% because of the use of gas fuel and electrical \\nefficiency. The CO2 emission can be reduced further when the post-combustion CO2 capture methods are applied. \\nTo perform CO2 capture and to reduce the CO2 emission from power plants, the CO2 mass fraction in flue gas is \\nthe crucial parameter for the operation of the Post-combustion Carbon Capture and Storage (PCCS) technology. \\nThe PCCS technology uses solvents, which is the aqueous solution of amine that reacts with flue gas and absorbs \\nthe CO2, which is treated and separated later. The paper presents the results of the energy analysis of a post- \\ncombustion carbon capture process when integrated with a combined cycle gas power plant. The study \\nconsidered two different gas fuels such as methane and syngas. Syngas composition was determined from the \\nsewage sludge gasification process and can be treated as zero-emission CO2 gas fuel. When the flue gas produced \\nfrom the syngas is used in PCCS at more than 50% of load conditions, the negative CO2 emission level in large- \\nscale CCGT power plants can be reached. The paper presents the results of mass and energy balance analysis of \\nHRSG of a CCGT integrated with PCCS to perform CO2 capture. The analysis of HRSG using flue gases from \\nmethane and syngas is performed by calculating the enthalpy of flue gas, rate of heat exchange, and temperature \\ndistribution of each component of HRSG. The comparison of the result shows slight differences due to the \\ndifferent composition and flow rates of flue gases. The flue gas at the outlet of two HRSG is used in the PCCS at \\ndifferent load conditions.

The loading points where a leap in absorption heat\\nappears coincide with those where the turbidity in solvents changes,\\nwhich was conﬁrmed by ocular inspection in both systems. In\\nliquid−liquid systems, the presence of water in 2-(ethylamino)-\\nethanol:diethylene glycol diethyl ether:water contributes to the decrease in absorption heat. Even though the formation of\\nbicarbonate is minor even in solvent with water, the increase in its formation contributes to this decrease in absorption heat because\\nof its lower formation heat as compared to that of carbamate.

        "Abstract": "\"Abstract\\nNew energy effective solvents are in demand to make global CO2 capture feasible. Phase \\nchange solvents seem to be one avenue to reach this goal. This paper presents new \\nexperimental data and modelling results for four amines that have potential as new solvents in \\nblends for post combustion CO2 capture. Both pure component data and data for amine-water \\nsolutions, based on ebulliometer measurements, are presented. The data were fitted to an \\nAntoine equation and an NRTL model in two ways: first in a combined fit of both pure \\ncomponent and binary data and then in separate fits to the individual data sets. The methods \\nwere compared and guidelines as to which method to use, based on available data, is \\nprovided. Data for 2-(Isopropylamino)ethanol (IPAE), N-tert-Butyldiethanolamine (N-\\nTBDEA), N-Methyl-1,3-diaminopropane (MAPA) and 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) from the \\nliterature were collected and compared with the new data sets.\\nAll data and model parameters are given. For all amines, the best fits provided good to \\nexcellent representations of the available data.\\nKeywords : Vapour-liquid equilibrium, pure amines, aqueous solutions, NRTL\\naCAS No. : Chemical Abstract Service Register Number\\nbin mass fraction taken from the Certificate of Analysis (COA). For MAPA, the water content was \\ngiven as 0.0011 mass fraction. No water content data for the other components were given.\\nPurities of supplied chemicals are specified in Table 1. All chemicals were used without \\nadditional purification. The water content of MAPA was given as a mass fraction of 0.0011. \\nNo water content data for the other components were given and we did not analyse for water \\nin this work. Earlier, tests have been run in our laboratory on changes in amine concentration \\nupon storage. We measured amine content in fresh amine and then again after \\nexperimentation, usually after a few days. The changes measured were below 0.1 wt. %.  \\nAll solutions were prepared with deionized water. Aqueous blends of the amines were \\nprepared based on weight (a Mettler PM1200 scale) giving a mass fraction accuracy of \\n \\n𝑢(𝑤)\\n= 0.00001, not taking purity into account. Blends were prepared up to mole fractions of \\nMAPA: 0.75, DAP: 0.81, IPAE: 0.97 and N-TBDEA: 0.36. The lower span for N-TBDEA \\nwas due to the high viscosity of the blends.\\nTitration solutions of H2SO4 were used to determine the amine concentration in the \\ncollected samples from the VLE experiments. Solutions of 0.1 mol∙dm=3 (\\uf07e0.976 wt. %) \\nH2SO4 were used for titration of amine samples with high amine content and solutions of 0.01 \\nmol/dm3 (\\uf07e0.098 wt. %)  H2SO4 were used as titrant of low concentration samples.\\n3.2. Density measurements\\nPure amine densities were measured at different temperatures up to 363 K. An Anton Paar \\nDMA 4500 densimeter was used for measurements. The densimeter determines the density of \\na liquid in a U-tube directly from the measured resonance frequency. The nominal \\nrepeatability of the instrument is given as \\n = 0.01 kg∙m-3 for density and \\n = 0.01 K \\n𝑢(𝜌)\\n𝑢(𝑇)\\nfor temperature. We have estimated the actual uncertainty in temperature to be \\n = 0.05 K \\n𝑢(𝑇)\\nand in density (0.5 and 1) kg∙m=3 as given in Table A1.  The detailed procedure can be found \\nin our previous work [17]. \\n3.3. Świętosławski ebulliometer\\nIn 1919 Cottrell [18] and Washburn [19] simultaneously published a method for precise \\nmeasuring of liquid boiling points and described instruments based on the same principle. \\nThis technique is now used as a rapid and robust method of measuring PT data for pure \\nliquids and PTxy data for binary solutions. Accurate data on vapour-liquid equilibrium are \\nimportant for accurate design of distillation columns and other chemical processing \\nequipment [20].\\nThe ebulliometric method of measuring vapour liquid equilibrium is like the operation of a \\ndistillation column at total reflux, see Figure 1, where heat is provided by a reboiler to \\nproduce vapour. The vapour is condensed at the top of column by a condenser and the \\ncondensed liquid flows down the column and re-enters the boiler. \\nSimilarly, the modified Świętosławski ebulliometer [21] used in this work is a closed \\nglassware with heater and no outlet stream. Equilibrium is established between liquid and \\nvapour phase after some time. Samples of both liquid and condensed vapour phase can be \\nwithdrawn and analysed for amine content. A detailed description of the ebulliometer is given \\nin our previous works [20; 22; 23], see also Olson [24].\\nIt is important to mention that the Świętosławski ebulliometer is designed for work with \\nliquids only. All chemicals and solutions that are loaded into it should remain in liquid form \\nduring operation.  Formation of crystals would not allow proper mixing of the boiling liquid, \\nthus preventing reaching the real equilibrium, and could cause damage of the glassware. Pure \\nDAP, IPAE and MAPA are liquids at ambient conditions, but N-TBDEA is a solid and \\naccording to the provider’s material safety data sheet, has a melting point at 313 K to 318 K. \\nIt was therefore pre-heated to 333 K before charging pure N-TBDEA into the Świętosławski \\nebulliometer. The empty Świętosławski ebulliometer was also pre-heated to 333K before \\npure N-TBDEA was charged to avoid crystallization of pure N-TBDEA. Otherwise the \\nexperimental procedures in this work were exactly the same as described by Kim et al. [20]. \\nMinor uncertainties are coming from pressure and temperature. The nominal accuracy of \\nthe pressure gage was 0.05% of full range, which means \\n = 0.1 kPa. However, because \\n𝑢(𝑃)\\nof uneven boiling, the recorded variation in pressure during the experiments was \\n = 0.25 \\n𝑢(𝑃)\\nkPa. The recorded temperature measurements varied within \\n = 0.1 K.  \\n𝑢(𝑇)\\nThe major source of uncertainty is the liquid and vapour phase analyses used for the \\ncalculation of activity coefficients, see section on sample analyses. \\nFigure 1. Simplified scheme of the full ebulliometer installation with gas supply lines and \\nconnection to the PC [20].\\n3.4. Sample analyses\\nTitration of the amine solutions was performed using an automatic titration apparatus, a \\nMettler Toledo G-20, and the LabX software program to register results of the titration. High \\nconcentration samples were analysed using 0.1 mol/dm3 (\\uf07e0.976 wt. %) H2SO4 as titrant and \\nlow concentration samples were analysed using 0.01 mol∙dm-3 (\\uf07e0.098 wt. %) H2SO4. The \\namine titration analyses typically give deviations less than (1 to 3)% between two parallel \\nsamples.  If larger deviations were observed, more samples were analysed.\\nThe combined composition accuracies vary with amine concentration and system. Based on \\nstandard uncertainties in temperature, pressure and amine analyses, the combined \\nuncertainties were estimated to vary significantly. Typically, the uncertainties at low amine \\nconcentrations were high both for the liquid and vapour phase. We have noted the appropriate \\nvalues in Tables A3-A6 in the appendix. \\n3.5. Parameter fitting of thermodynamic model\\nTo calculate the five parameters in the NRTL thermodynamic model, the independent \\nvariables, i.e. x and T, are set in the objective function according to Eq. (5):\\n \\n(5)\\n𝑂𝐹= ∑𝑁\\n𝑖= 1(|\\nℝ𝐸𝑥𝑝― ℝ𝐶𝑎𝑙\\nℝ𝐸𝑥𝑝|)\\nWhere \\n denotes the responses or the dependent variable from the ebulliometric \\nℝ\\nexperiment.\\nDifferent responses i.e. saturation pressure\\n, total pressure \\n and vapour phase \\n (𝑃𝑆𝑖)\\n(𝑃𝑖)\\ncomposition of amine \\n were weighed equally in the objective function. An in-house \\n(𝑦𝑖)\\nmatlab program ‘Modfit’ for parameter estimation in a general nonlinear multiresponse model \\nwas used for the parameter fitting [25]. \\nThe absolute average relative deviation (AARD) represents the deviation of the model \\nresults from the experimental data as expressed by Eq. (6):\\n(6)\\n𝐴𝐴𝑅𝐷𝑖=\\n1\\n𝑁∑𝑁\\n𝑖= 1(|\\nℝ𝐸𝑥𝑝― ℝ𝐶𝑎𝑙\\nℝ𝐸𝑥𝑝|)\\n4. Results, modelling and discussion\\n4.1.

The accuracy of the given correlations is good with an R2 estimated to be \\nclose to unity. Data from Lampreia et al. [6] fit very well with our data for IPAE. However, \\ndiscrepancies exist in the data for MAPA. The difference between data from Wang et al. [5] \\nand Liao et al. [4] for MAPA is about 1-1.5% as seen in Figure 2.  Based on the supplied \\npurities, we have estimated the uncertainties in our density measurements to be \\n = 1 \\n𝑢(𝜌)\\nkg/m3 for both MAPA and IPAE, see [26]. Thus, the discrepancy between the three \\nmeasurement sets for MAPA is large. Similar types of densimeters as in this work were used, \\nrespectively an SMV 3000 Stabinger and a DMA 5000M. Our measurements lie between the \\ntwo literature sources and the temperature dependency shown by the three sets of data is the \\nsame. The discrepancies seen may be due to different origins of MAPA with different \\nimpurities, since all measurements were done on MAPA as received. In our case the CoA \\npurity given for MAPA was 99.2 wt. % and with 0.11 wt. % water. \\nFor DAP, our data fit very well with data from Saleh, et al. [7] and [8]. Based on the purity \\nof the supplied DAP, 99.9 wt. %, we have estimated the uncertainty in the density \\nmeasurements to be \\n = 0.5 kg∙m-3. At 298.15 K three more data points exist [9; 10; 11]. \\n𝑢(𝜌)\\nThese three data points are significantly lower than the data from Saleh, et al. [7] [8].\\nFor N-TBDEA, no prior data were found in the literature.  Based on the purity of the \\nsupplied N-TBDEA, we have estimated the uncertainty in the density measurements to be \\n = 0.5 kg∙m-3. In this case, we ran two parallels for each temperature. From Table A1, the \\n𝑢(𝜌)\\ndifference between parallels is seen to be below 0.02%, well below our estimated uncertainty.\\n4.2 VLE of pure components and binary amine-water mixtures\\nThe pure component vapour pressure results are given in the appendix in Table A2 and the \\nbinary VLE data in Tables A3-6. \\n 4.2.1 Pure component data\\nAs mentioned earlier, the ebulliometer measurements were performed as constant pressure \\nmeasurements, i.e. the pressure is set and the temperature to obtain that pressure is measured. \\nFor parallel measurements the pressure will therefore typically be the same, as seen in Table \\nA2, and the temperature will vary. However, the temperature measurements are more \\naccurate than the pressure measurements. Based on this, we have chosen to use the nominal \\naccuracy for temperature, \\n = 0.1K and attach the total measurement uncertainty to \\n𝑢(𝜌)\\npressure. The standard uncertainty of the pressure measurements in this work is estimated \\nfrom parallel experiments and varies between amines. The highest uncertainty is found for \\nthe lowest temperatures and the lowest uncertainty is for the highest temperatures. The \\nappropriate values are found below Table A.2. In all cases the uncertainty is smaller than the \\ncircle size in Figures 3-6.  \\nThe data are plotted in Figures 3-6 and fitted to Antoine equations. The regressed \\nparameters are given in Table 3A together with the accuracy (AARD) for the individual fits. \\nThe pure component data were fitted by two alternative methods. In the first method, only the \\npure component data were considered. In the second method, the pure component data were \\nfitted together with the binary data in a combined fit. Both sets of fitted parameters are given \\nin Table 3A. As mentioned earlier, some of the data for N-TBDEA and DAP were published \\nin anonymized form in Trollebø et al. [3]. Unfortunately, the pure component data for N-\\nTBDEA, component B in Table 1 in Trollebø et al. [3], are erroneous and should be \\ndisregarded. \\nMAPA\\n260\\n280\\n300\\n320\\n340\\n360\\n380\\n400\\n420\\n440\\n T/ K\\n10-2\\n10-1\\n100\\n101\\n102\\n103\\nP/ kPa\\nFigure 3. Vapour pressure of pure MAPA.

Most of the data, Kim et al. [20], Hartono et al. [23] and Bouzina et \\nal. [27], agree very well with each other and also with data obtained in this work. Bouzina et \\nal. [27] give the uncertainty of their pressure measurements to be less than 3% of the actual \\nvalue for the low pressure measurements (<600 Pa) and better than this for higher pressures. \\nThis is also smaller than the circle size in Figure 3. The data of Verevkin and Chernyak [28] \\nin the low temperature range, are low compared to the data from Bouzina et al. [27]. The \\nreason may be the use of a dynamic technique, the transpiration method, where gas is blown \\nover a large surface coated with solvent. It may be that vapour-liquid equilibrium is not \\nreached in the exiting gas and thereby the reported values may become too low. \\nKim et al. [20] provided Antoine parameters and from the blue line in Figure 3 it is seen \\nthat this fitting agrees very well with the data of Bouzina et al. [27] at low temperatures and \\nall the higher temperature data. It should be noted that the data by Bouzina et al. [27] were \\nnot used in this fit.  Since we cannot decide for sure what data sets to trust at low \\ntemperature, we have used all data in our fits. As seen by the green line in Figure 3, when \\nfitted to only pure component data, the data by Verevkin and Chernyak [28] pulls the fit \\ndown in the low temperature region. This is as expected because of the large number of data \\npoints from them. At higher temperatures this fit coincides with the one by Kim et al. [20]. \\nWhen the pure component and binary data were fitted together, shown by the red line in \\nFigure 3, the pressure curve is pulled upwards in the low temperature region and lies between \\nthe fit by Kim et al. [20] and our pure component fit.  The AARD for the pure component \\nand combined fits are quite similar, respectively 3.1 and 4.5%, as given in Table 3A. The \\nreason for the relatively high AARD values is the discrepancy between the low temperature \\ndata. To resolve this, more data in this range are needed. It can be noted that by omitting the \\ndata by Verevkin and Chernyak [28] in the fitting, the AARD values go down to respectively \\n1.5% and 2%.\\nA curve based on the Antoine parameters provided by Yaws et al. [29] is also shown in \\nFigure 3. These parameters give vapour pressures slightly lower than the experimental values. \\nThe discrepancy is largest in the middle temperature range. \\nThe water content in the MAPA used in these tests was given as 0.11 wt. % which \\ncorresponds to approximately a mole fraction of 0.0051. Assuming an ideal solution, the \\ncontribution of water to the total pressure measured was found to be <2% for all cases. The \\npressures given in Table A.2 are the measured total pressures and not corrected for water \\npressure.\\nDAP\\nFor DAP, some pure component vapour pressure data exist. Ahmed, et al. [30] provide data \\nfor the low and middle temperature region, data from Pozdeev and Verevkin [31] cover the \\nlow temperature region, whereas this work provides data for the middle to higher \\ntemperatures. In addition there are two data points from Pividal and Sandler[32] in the middle \\ntemperature region. Very recently Fulem, et al. [33] reported data for the low and the middle \\ntemperature region. All data are shown in Figure 4.\\n200\\n250\\n300\\n350\\n400\\n450\\n T/ K\\n10-4\\n10-3\\n10-2\\n10-1\\n100\\n101\\n102\\n103\\nP/ kPa\\n280\\n300\\n320\\n340\\n100\\nFigure 4.

The data from Ahmed et al. [30] seem to be \\nslightly high, but also in reasonable agreement with the rest.  Data from Pozdeev and \\nVerevkin[31] fill the gap between the low temperature data of  Fulem, et al. [33] and our \\ndata. Based on their two data points, which fit well with our data, Pividal and Sandler[32] \\npostulated an Antoine equation, the green line in Figure 4,  which agrees with the data of \\nPozdeev and Verevkin[31], but deviates from the data of Fulem, et al. [33] in the low \\ntemperature range. The Antoine equation given by Yaws et al. [29] agrees well with the data. \\nThe pure component and combined fits, both based on data from this work and all data \\nfrom the literature, as shown by the red and blue lines respectably in figure 4, give very \\nsimilar results.

The data provided in this work comprises two individual measurement \\nseries performed over a period of several months and covers the high temperature region. The \\nreproducibility between the three sets is seen in Figure 5 to be acceptable, but one of the sets \\ngive slightly lower values that the others.

Vapour pressure of pure N-TBDEA. (All points, this work; Blue line: fit to only \\npure component data; Red line: fit to combined data; Black line, [29])\\nNo pure component vapour pressure data were found for N-TBDEA in the literature, \\ndisregarding the erroneous data in Trollebø et al. [3]. The data sets provided in this work \\nconsist of 16 data points, all in the high temperature range. The reason for this is that the pure \\ncomponent vapour pressures were very low such that the accuracy became unsatisfactory at \\nlower temperatures. The data are based on three data sets obtained at different times. The \\npurity given by the provider (Sigma-Aldrich) was the same for all N-TBDEA batches \\nreceived. However, two of the batches were solid, whereas the third was in liquid form. This \\nis in line with the information provided by the Sigma-Aldrich data sheet. All vapour pressure \\ndata obtained, as given in Figure 6 and Table A2, are for temperatures above the N-TBDEA \\nmelting point, i.e. for the liquid state. The data in Figure 6 show excellent reproducibility and \\nthat no difference in vapour pressure exists between the batches. The pure vapour pressure \\ndata were used in the NRTL model for binary data in a combined fit. Since the binary data \\nonly go up to 373 K, small uncertainties in the pure component model could result in \\ndiscrepancies in the binary model. Thus, in this case, fitting the binary and pure component \\ndata together was a necessity. We see in Figure 6 that a small difference between the pure \\ncomponent and combined fits exists. However, the differences seen in the lower temperature \\nrange did not result in any difference in AARD between the pure component and combined \\nfits, both being 1.6%, as seen in Table 3A. This is because the curves overlap in the range \\nwere experimental pure component data exist as shown in the magnified part of Figure 6. \\nPredictions based on Antoine parameters from Yaw et al. [29], given by the black line in \\nFigure 6, are shown to be much to high compared to the experimental data in the \\nexperimental temperature range.\\nTable 3A shows that the standard deviations on the parameters are reasonable only for \\nMAPA. For DAP, IPAE and N-TBDEA, the standard deviations in the B and C parameters \\nare of the same size as, or larger than the parameter values. This indicates that the objective \\nfunction probably has a flat optimum and that several possible parameter combinations exist, \\ngiving approximately the same goodness of fit.\\nTable 3A.

Some of the data were \\npreviously published in anonymized form in Trollebø et al. [3], but with several mistakes. In \\nTable 3 in Trollebø et al. [3], all pressures are in mbar, not kPa as said in the table heading. In \\nTable 4 in Trollebø et al. [3], for 60 and 100oC the temperature columns actually give the pressures \\nin kPa and the pressure columns give pressures in mbar. The corrected data are found in Tables A3-\\nA6\\nThe plots of data plus the NRTL model representations are given below. Regressed NRTL \\nmodel parameters were calculated using both the combined pure component and binary \\nexperimental VLE data and separate pure component and binary fits and are given in Table \\n4A and 4B. It should be noted that all amines are assumed to behave as non-dissociated \\nspecies because of their high pKa values. A thorough explanation can be found in our \\nprevious work [22]. All the fits were made based on mole fractions. The largest uncertainties \\nin the data are the liquid and gas phase analyses, in particular for low mole fractions. The \\nestimated standard uncertainties vary and are given below Tables A3-A6. \\nMAPA\\nIn Figure 7A shows PTxy data for the MAPA(1)/H2O(2) system based on data from Kim et \\nal. [20] covering the temperature range from 313 K to 373 K, and from the present work at \\n333 K and 353 K. The data sets are seen to agree well in the range of low MAPA contents, \\nbelow a mole fraction of about 0.25. However, above this level, the data from Kim et al. [20] \\nshow higher pressures than the data from the present work. Data from Bouzina et al. [27] are \\nalso given and are shown to agree well with data from the present work. The model fit based \\non the combined pure component and binary data from this work, Kim et al. [20] and  \\nBouzina et al.

This is also shown in Figures S6 and S7 \\nin the supplementary information, which are nearly identical to Figures 7 and 8.\\nWith PTxy data it is possible to check the thermodynamic consistency according to the \\nGibbs-Duhem equation, see Kim et al. [20], Van Ness and Iserman [35] and Prausnitz et al. \\n[36]. The NRTL model is inherently thermodynamic consistent, so parity plots between \\nexperimental data and model will give a good indication of the consistency of the data. Figure \\nS1 in the supplementary information shows parity plots for the model and the present data, \\nindicating good thermodynamic consistency for MAPA. Bouzina et al. [27] provided only \\nPTx data, but calculated y-values. The thermodynamic consistency of these data is given in \\nFigure S2 in the supporting information and indicates that their calculated vapour \\ncompositions should be used with care.\\nDAP\\nFigure 9A shows PTxy data for the DAP(1)/H2O(2) system based on data from the present \\nwork at 343K, 353K and 373K.

The agreement is excellent up to an amine weight fraction of about \\n0.6, covering the most interesting industrial range. Above this value, the discrepancies \\nbetween model and experimental data increase with amine content and with decreasing \\ntemperature. At the lowest temperatures, (293 K and 303 K), the experimental data show \\nunexpected increases in vapour pressure around an amine weight fraction of 0.9. The NRTL \\nmodel seems to indicate a very weak azeotrope around 0.9 in amine mole fraction. No \\nexperimental data exist to validate this. The AARD for pressure is 1.7% as given in Table \\n4A.\\nFigure 10 compares experimental and NRTL-model based activity coefficients for the \\nDAP(1)/H2O(2) system. Water activity coefficients are predicted well over the whole \\nexperimental concentration range, whereas the activity coefficients for DAP are under-\\npredicted above amine mole fractions of about 0.3. The AARD for the fit of DAP vapour \\nphase composition is 11.9% as seen in Table 4A.\\nResults from the model based on a separate fit of pure component and binary data are \\nshown in Figures S8 and S9 in the supplementary information and these are almost identical \\nto Figures 9 and 10. Table 4B shows the AARDs for P and y this case, respectively 1.8 and \\n12.1%, only marginally higher than for the combined fit. Both the binary system fits and pure \\ncomponent fits are quite close, with AARDs of 2.1 and 2.7% respectively, the choice of \\nfitting method seems not important in this case. Tables 4A and 4B also give standard \\ndeviations on the parameters. We see that for DAP, the standard deviations are larger, and for \\nsome parameters much larger, than the parameters themselves. This indicates a flat objective \\nfunction optimum for the binary fit and that several possible parameter combinations may \\ngive approximately the same goodness of fit. \\n0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n1\\n x1\\n0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1\\n1.2\\ni\\nFigure 10.

What characterizes this system is the apparently very low \\ntemperature sensitivity of the activity coefficients. The scatter in the data, notably in the \\nhigher amine concentration range, is larger than the model predicted temperature sensitivity. \\nIt should be noted that the pure component fit will influence the activity coefficients \\ncalculated from the experimental data, and thereby the binary model temperature sensitivity. \\nThe AARD for the fit of IPAE vapour phase composition is 6.9% as seen in Table 4A. As for \\nDAP, the standard deviations on the parameters are of the same size or larger than the \\nparameters. Figure S4 in the supporting information shows that the thermodynamic \\nconsistency of the data is reasonable, apart from at the higher amine concentrations where the \\ndata scatter is the highest. The reason for the larger scatter in the data for the IPAE(1)/H2O(2) \\nsystem compared to MAPA and DAP, is believed to be due to the significantly lower \\nvolatility of IPAE and thereby higher uncertainty in the gas phase analyses. In Figure 11, we \\nalso see that the gas phase curves are close to flat in the higher concentration range. This \\nmakes the activity coefficients very sensitive to small errors in the gas phase composition \\nanalysis.\\nFitting the pure component and binary data separately was also done. The results are given \\nin Table 4B and shown graphically in Figures S10 and S11 in the supporting information. We \\nsee that the AARDs for pressure and vapour phase composition rise to 3.3 and 10.1% \\nrespectively. Also, the standard deviations on the parameters become higher than the \\nparameters themselves. Clearly, a combined fit gives a better result in this case. This was not \\nthe conclusion for DAP and the reason for this difference is believed to be the amine \\nvolatility. The fit of the binary data will depend on the pure component data and the fit to \\nthese data. When the amine volatility is low, the sensitivity to errors in the pure component \\ndata is high, whereas when the volatility is high, this reduces the sensitivity to errors in the \\npure component data. In addition, the pure component data for IPAE only extended down to \\n363K. In order to validate the model further, more pure component data are needed, \\nparticularly for temperatures below 363K. \\n0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n1\\n x1\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n1,\\n2\\nFigure 12.

Only PTx data are thus \\navailable, as shown in Figure 13.

We see that the predicted amine \\nactivity coefficients become very large at low concentrations. This should be taken as an \\nindication only, and vapour composition data are needed to validate the model. The situation \\nis similar for the predicted water activity coefficients at low water concentrations. They are \\nseen to increase to values 2 to 3. \\nFitting the parameters to pure component and binary data separately was also done in this \\ncase. The fits are shown in Figures S12 and S13 in supporting information and the AARD is \\ngiven in Table 4B. The AARD did not change and no visible effect is seen in Figures S12 and \\nS13. The main reason for this is the large difference in temperature range between the pure \\ncomponent (413 K to 453 K) and binary (313 K to 373 K) data. We see in Figure 6 that using \\na combined fit only has a small impact on the pure component predictions, even at lower \\ntemperatures. \\n0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1\\n xi\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\n40\\n1,\\n2\\nFigure 14 Calculated activity coefficients for N-TBDEA(1)/H2O(2).

Aqueous solutions of DAP and MAPA show \\nstrong negative deviations from Raoult's law in the whole range of amine concentrations. \\nThe model for DAP may indicate a minimum azeotrope formation at high amine \\nconcentrations and below 313K. No information to substantiate this has been found in the \\nliterature \\nSince the possible azeotropic point of DAP is lying in the high concentration range, outside \\nthe practical range for an absorption process, it may seem of less industrial interest. However, \\nsituations can occur, when considering aerosol formation in the absorber and water wash \\nsystems, where evapouration of water and condensation of amine on the aerosol droplets can \\nlead to very high amine concentrations. Examples of such behavior are given in Majeed et al. \\n[37; 38; 39; 40].\\nAqueous solutions of IPAE and N-TBDEA show positive deviations from Raoult's law in \\nthe whole range of amine concentrations. This means that the interaction between amine-H2O \\nmolecules for these solutions is weaker than between amine-amine and H2O-H2O molecules. \\nN-TBDEA show especially strong deviations from Raoult's law. These solutions seem to \\nhave very high amine activity coefficients at infinite dilution. For IPAE the activity \\ncoefficients increase slightly with temperature. The activity coefficients of N-TBDEA are \\nmuch higher than for IPAE and are also predicted to increase with temperature.\\n5. Conclusions\\nThis paper presents new experimental data and modelling results for four amines. All have \\npotential as new solvents for post combustion CO2 capture. Both pure component data and \\ndata for amine-water solutions, based on ebulliometer measurements, are presented. The data \\nwere fitted to an Antoine equation and an NRTL model in two ways, first a combined fit of \\nboth pure component and binary data and then a separate fit to the data sets. \\nFor MAPA, a relatively volatile amine, and with many both pure component and binary \\nPTxy data points covering the whole temperature and concentration region of interest, the \\ntwo procedures gave very similar results.\\nFor DAP, also a relatively volatile amine, and with a large number of binary PTxy data \\npoints and sufficient pure component data covering the whole range of temperatures, the two \\nmethods gave similar AARDs for both the binary and pure component fits. The standard \\ndeviations on the parameters were larger than the parameters for both procedures indicating \\nthat more data, in particular binary data, are needed. \\nWith IPAE, a less volatile amine, limited pure component data were available and some \\ndiscrepancies in the sets were found. However, the data cover a large temperature range. The \\nbinary PTxy data covered the whole composition range and most of the temperature range. In \\nthis case, the combined fit gave a good representation of both the pure component and binary \\ndata. However, the standard deviations on the parameters were large. The fit to separate data \\nset resulted in an increase in the AARD’s for both the pure component and binary data sets \\nand large standard deviations in the parameters.\\nFor N-TBDEA, an amine with low volatility, the data contained only pure component and \\nbinary PTx measurements. In this case, the two fitting procedures provided fits with similar \\nAARDS. \\nFor all amines, the best fits provided good to excellent representations of the available data.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \\nFinancial support for this work by Aker Clean Carbon, EON, EnBW and the Norwegian \\nResearch Council CLIMIT program through the SOLVit project is greatly appreciated.\\nReferences\\n[1]\\nG.T.

Absorption with chemical solvents (alkanolamines in aqueous\\nsolutions) is the most widely used conventional technology for CO2 capture.

This work presents an experimental study related to the kinetic and thermodynamic\\nanalysis of high-pressure CO2 capture using ethylenediamine (EDA) as a chemical solvent. EDA\\nhas two amine groups that can increase the CO2 capture capacity per unit of solvent. A non-stirred\\nexperimental setup was installed and commissioned for CO2 capture testing. Tests of the solubility\\nof CO2 in water were carried out to validate the experimental setup. CO2 capture testing was\\naccomplished using EDA in aqueous solutions (0, 5, 10, and 20 wt.% in amine). Finally, a kinetic\\nmodel involving two steps was proposed, including a rapid absorption step and a slow diffusion step.\\nEDA accelerated the CO2 capture performance. Sudden temperature increases were observed during\\nthe initial minutes. The CO2 capture was triggered after the absorption of a minimal amount of CO2\\n(~10 mmol) into the liquid solutions, and could correspond to the “lean amine acid gas loading” in\\na typical sweetening process using alkanolamines. At equilibrium, there was a linear relationship\\nbetween the CO2 loading and the EDA concentration.

        "Title": "'From hybrid solvents to water-lean solvents – A critical and \\nhistorical review \\n'",
        "Abstract": "'A B S T R A C T   \\nEvery year, a plethora of studies focused on developing water-lean solvents for CO2 capture is published in the \\nscientific literature. More often than not, these studies lack a satisfactory contextualization with the previous \\nbody of work. The reasons for this are manyfold, but perhaps the main culprit is the multitude of possible diluent \\nand amine constituents for water-lean solvent formulation. This multitude of options can render a comprehensive \\nanalysis of water-lean solvents and their common properties quite a challenging task. However, precisely because \\nthere is such a diversity of results and observations, the ordering and categorization of distinct phenomena \\ninvolving water-lean solvents is the more essential. Although there are some novel sophisticated deployements \\nfor the concept of organo-amine mixtures (such as the CO2BOLs and the NAS for example), many works on water- \\nlean solvents adopt a traditionalistic approach, one that is conceptually based on the mixing of a physical and a \\nchemical absorbent to generate a so-called hybrid solvent. We have demonstrated in this review that this \\nparticular class of solvents have more in common than one could be initially led to believe, and set clear \\nguidelines to contextualize past and future results in terms of CO2 solubility, kinetic rates, mass transfer rates and \\nheat of regeneration analyses. By doing this, we have also identified the main knowledge gaps remaining in the \\nfield of water-lean solvents – namely, degradation and corrosion data, as well as pilot plant data. We also believe \\nthat our comprehensive categorization and discussion of past literature on water-lean solvents delivers an \\nimportant trove of references for those willing to carry on working with organo-amine mixtures, traditional or \\notherwise. With this study, we aim to aid future researchers to have easy access to key concepts for discussing \\ntheir results.   \\nwants to generate. The second, a bit more abstract, is what one perceives \\nas being the ideal properties of a solvent for CO2 absorption. \\nRegarding the first factor, one could consider Fig. 1 adapted from the \\nbook Fundamentals of Natural Gas Processing [19]. In Fig. 1, one can \\nidentify the locus for hybrid solvents in the context of gas qualities. \\nHybrid solvents are indicated for absorbing CO2 from gases with high \\nimpurity content and, more importantly, high pressures, adding up to \\nCO2 partial pressures above 700 kPa (7 bars). \\nIn this conception, hybrid solvents are viewed in light of their \\ndouble-absorption qualities. The keyword for them is capacity. The \\nperformance of these solvents is seen to override that of aqueous amines \\nat high pressures due to the crossing-over factor (which we will discuss \\nin detail in Section 4). This is perhaps too restrictive. The demand of 700 \\nkPa of CO2 partial pressure essentially bars the utilization of hybrid \\nsolvents in any post-combustion capture applications, as it does with \\nbiogas upgrading applications. This means that hybrid solvents should \\nonly be suitable for very particular pre-combustion capture scenarios. In \\nthe 1960s and 1970s, industrial processes such as the Amisol® process \\n[20], the Sulfinol® process and the Selefining® process gained territory \\nin pre-combustion capture [21], all operating with hybrid solvents. \\nOne important remark is that it was often not the intention of these \\ntreating processes to generate a CO2 stream that was pure enough for \\nCSS (carbon capture and storage, i.e. either geological storage, enhanced \\noil recovery or selling as a product). Their goal was producing natural \\ngas with high heating value. With the aim shifting in the past few de\\xad\\ncades towards climate change mitigation technologies, the CO2 purity \\nobtained by most physical solvent treatments starts to become a problem \\n[21]. Standing on the edge between physical and chemical absorption, \\nhybrid solvents developed then might not be as interesting now. Another \\ninteresting factor is the higher selectivity that hybrid solvents have for \\nH2S instead of CO2 absorption, a feature often perceived as a positive \\npoint of these technologies in the context of natural gas treatment [21]. \\nMany early investigations measure both H2S and CO2 solubilities in \\nhybrid solvents [22–24]. Isaacs et al. [25], for example, clearly show \\nthat the Sulfinol-D® solvent excels in H2S absorption at acid gas partial \\npressures way below those for the crossing-over with CO2 when \\ncompared with aqueous DIPA. \\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw some publications on hybrid solvents \\nhighlighting their vapor–liquid equilibria and CO2 capacities. And then, \\nin the new millennium, more researches started to focus on a different \\naspect: volatility. According to a number of investigations, the potential \\nfor low volatilities in water-lean solvents renders them attractive due to \\nthe possibility of recovering the loaded amine while incurring in less \\nlatent heat expenditures (i.e. less heat is directed towards the vapor\\xad\\nization of the solvent). Studies that propose mixing MEA with diluents \\nsuch as glycerol [26] and coconut oil [27] are very clear in highlighting \\nthis aspect of water-lean solvents. In fact, low volatilities have also been \\na driving force in the popularization of ionic liquids [28], and Shamiri \\net al. [26] have explicitly declared their intent in developing an inex\\xad\\npensive green ionic liquid-inspired solvent when mixing MEA with \\nglycerol. \\nSome other researchers are also optimistic about the huge potential \\nfor diversity in water-lean solvent formulation. Given this diversity they \\ncan, for example, resort to computational techniques to quickly evaluate \\nthe best combination of chemicals to obtain just the right mixture for an \\nhypothetical solvent based on a set of key properties [29,30]. With \\nwater-lean solvents, the possibilities could be endless. This clearly shows \\nthe shifting of purposes observed for water-lean solvents from the 1970s \\nto the 2010s. \\nThe formation of a secondary phase upon CO2 absorption, either \\nthrough liquid–liquid separation or solid precipitation, had been usually \\nseen as an undesirable aspect of some water-lean mixtures. As an \\nexample, Leites [31] mentions having screened more than 130 possible \\ndiluents for solvent formulation, promptly rejecting all which lead to \\nphase separation. Conversely, the arrival of biphasic systems as possible \\nadvantageous CO2 absorption techniques [8] has recently lead re\\xad\\nsearchers such as Karlsson et al. [32] to specifically target diluents that \\nbrought forth carbamate precipitation. Many recent studies focus solely \\non phase separation in water-lean solvents. \\nShifting perspectives have brought a renewal of interest in water- \\nlean solvents. And yet, careful reading of past literature would do well \\nto many of the newcomers. The slow absorption rates in mixtures con\\xad\\ntaining very viscous compounds can be foreseen in the seminal work of \\nWoertz in 1972 [33] and keeps being rediscovered. The benefits of low \\nvolatilities in water-lean blends, with the caveat that solvent regenera\\xad\\ntion should perhaps require stripping with an inert gas, is demonstrated \\nby Rivas and Prausnitz in 1979 [34]. Right now, water-lean solvents are \\nbeing considered for CCS applications. These applications require that \\nCO2 is produced with a high degree of purity, something that is not \\nconvenient if desorption must be performed with a stripping gas. Or \\nperhaps an application for water-lean solvents other than CCS will \\nbecome attractive again. One is left to wonder if the extremely high CO2 \\ncontent (more than 40 %v/v) typical of natural gas extracted from \\nrecently discovered oil fields such as the Brazilian Pre-Salt [35,36] could \\nprovide a renewal of interest in hybrid solvents.'"

This paper contains a brief overview of CCUS followed by a discussion\\nof several aspects of amine-based CO2 capture technologies.\\nGlobal warming\\nRadiation from the Earth’s surface is absorbed by green-\\nhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere.\\nThe resulting increase in temperature is equivalent to 30 °C\\nor more globally on average [1, 2]. This means that the\\nEarth’s surface temperature would be below 0 °C without\\ngreenhouse gases. Global warming is an urgent problem\\nfacing our planet due to an increase in greenhouse gases in\\nthe atmosphere caused by human activities. The rise in the\\nglobal average temperature, albeit small compared with the\\nabovementioned natural greenhouse effect, is thought to\\nhave serious consequences for various ecosystems [3, 4].\\nThe Swedish physical chemist Svante Arrhenius ﬁrst\\nproposed that a global temperature rise of several °C could\\noccur due to CO2 emitted from the use of fossil fuels such\\nas coal and oil [5]. It seems that he slightly overestimated\\nthe greenhouse effect of CO2 while underestimating the\\nincrease in human-driven CO2 emissions. The global\\nwarming that we experience today is progressing at a faster\\nrate than Arrhenius’ prediction. In 2017, human-induced\\nwarming reached approximately 1 °C above pre-industrial\\nlevels, increasing at a rate of 0.2 °C per decade [6].\\nWithin the United Nations Framework Convention on\\nClimate Change, the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015\\nand entered into force in 2016. Its central aim is to\\nstrengthen the global response to the threat of climate\\nchange by limiting the increase in the global average tem-\\nperature to well below 2 °C from pre-industrial levels and\\npursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C\\n[7]. Following the Paris Agreement, the Special Report,\\nGlobal Warming of 1.5 °C [6], was approved by the Inter-\\ngovernmental\\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) and\\nreleased in 2018. The report stated that global warming is\\nlikely to reach 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues\\nto increase at the current rate.\\nIn 2017, the International Energy Agency (IEA) pre-\\nsented potential energy sector development to 2060,\\nnamely, the 2 °C scenario (2DS) and beyond the 2 °C sce-\\nnario (B2DS). This path of rapid decarbonization is in line\\nwith the Paris Agreement [8]. In both 2DS and B2DS,\\ncarbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) and the imple-\\nmentation of renewable energy technologies such as wind,\\nsolar, geothermal, and biomass play an indispensable role in\\nachieving these targets.\\nCarbon dioxide capture, utilization and\\nstorage (CCUS)\\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in carbon\\ndioxide capture and utilization (CCU), a technology for the\\nreuse of captured CO2 [9–12]. The amount of CO2\\n* Hidetaka Yamada\\nhyamada@rite.or.jp\\n1\\nResearch Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE),\\n9-2 Kizugawadai, Kizugawa, Kyoto 619-0292, Japan\\n1234567890();,:\\n1234567890();,:\\nconverted into chemicals and other non-chemical applica-\\ntions today is less than 200 Mt/y globally [13]. As shown in\\nTable 1, it has mainly been used for urea production. It\\nshould be noted that the current CO2 demand is signiﬁcantly\\nless than global energy-related CO2 emissions (>30 Gt/y)\\n[8]. Hepburn et al. [14] analyzed CO2 utilization trends and\\nestimated that the utilization potentials of chemicals, fuels,\\nand concrete building materials in 2050 are 300−600 Mt/y,\\n1000−4200 Mt/y, and 100−1400 Mt/y, respectively.\\nTo limit the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere in the\\n1970s, Italian physicist Cesare Marchetti proposed a CO2\\nmanagement system in which CO2 is collected at proper fuel\\ntransformation points and transferred into the deep seas [15].\\nHe also proposed that disposal could be performed in the\\nform of permanent underground storage by using exhausted\\ngas ﬁelds, oil ﬁelds, or similar cavities. Then, the IPCC\\nWorking Group III, which is responsible for mitigating cli-\\nmate change, published a special report on CCS in 2005\\n[16, 17]. CCS is the process of CO2 separation from industrial\\nand energy-related sources, transportation to a storage loca-\\ntion, and long-term isolation from the atmosphere. CCS is\\nwidely recognized as an effective CO2 ﬁxation technology\\nand has grown in importance ever since [18–24].\\nThe special report on CCS has two major chapters on\\nCO2 storage, namely, underground geological storage and\\nocean storage. In the former chapter, the global geological\\nstorage capacity in oil/gas ﬁelds and deep saline formations\\nwere estimated to be 675−900 Gt and 103−104 Gt,\\nrespectively [16], indicating that CCS can play a signiﬁcant\\nrole in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The largest\\nchange since then is that ocean storage of CO2 is no longer\\nconsidered a viable option [25].\\nCO2 capture in large-scale CCS facilities\\nAmong large-scale CCS facilities in the world with a\\ncapacity of at least 400,000 t/y, nineteen of them were\\noperating in 2019 [26]. In Table 2, information on the CCS\\nprojects based on the Global CCS Institute (GCCSI) data-\\nbase [27] and additional surveys [28–36] is listed.\\nThe majority of the nineteen CCS facilities capture CO2\\nfor natural gas processing. The Sleipner CO2 injection was\\nthe world’s ﬁrst industrial offshore CCS project [32, 36].\\nNatural gas produced in the Sleipner Vest ﬁeld contains ca.\\n9% CO2 and must be reduced to less than 2.5% for the gas\\nto meet speciﬁcations prior to being sold. The CO2 captured\\nwith\\namine\\nscrubbing\\nusing\\naqueous\\nN-\\nmethyldiethanolamine (MDEA) solutions containing ca.\\n2% methane (CH4) has been injected into a saline aquifer at\\na rate of approximately 1 Mt/y since 1996. Notably, con-\\nsidering the high global warming potential of CH4 [37], its\\neffect would be non-negligible if the byproduct of the CO2\\nremoval process was released into the atmosphere.\\nIn addition to natural gas processing, large-scale CCS\\nfacilities are currently in operation for chemical, hydrogen\\n(H2) and steel production as well as power generation. CO2\\ncapture from fossil fuel power plants has some technical\\nhurdles based on the characteristics of exhaust gas: rela-\\ntively low CO2 partial pressure, the presence of signiﬁcant\\namounts of oxygen (O2), and impurities such as sulfur\\noxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) [38–40]. Unit 3 at\\nthe Boundary Dam power station in Saskatchewan is the\\nworld’s ﬁrst commercial-scale CCS process on a coal-ﬁred\\npower plant [32, 35]. The retroﬁt with a capture capacity of\\napproximately 1 Mt-CO2/y is based on regenerable amine\\ntechnology by Shell Cansolv. It was designed to allow the\\ninstallation of CCS equipment that would convert Unit 3\\ninto a reliable long-term producer of clean base-load elec-\\ntricity. Simultaneously, the captured CO2 is used for\\nenhanced oil recovery (EOR) [41, 42] in the province. The\\nPetra Nova project [32, 35] is the world’s largest post-\\ncombustion CO2 capture system with a capture capacity of\\n1.4 Mt-CO2/y. It has been in operation since 2017 and uses\\na proprietary amine solvent, KS-1, which was developed by\\nthe Kansai Electric Power Co. and Mitsubishi Heavy\\nIndustries, Ltd [43]. The captured CO2 is transported via a\\npipeline to an oil ﬁeld for EOR.\\nIn the IPCC special report on CCS [16], CO2 capture\\ntechnologies were categorized into three separation meth-\\nods: separation with sorbents/solvents, separation with\\nmembranes,\\nand\\nseparation\\nby\\ncryogenic\\ndistillation.\\nAmong these methods, cryogenic distillation seems to be\\nunsuitable for large-scale CCS. This is because distillation\\nis an energy intensive process with the power requirement\\nestimated to be 600–660 kWh/t-CO2 due to the extremely\\nlow temperature and high pressure of the process [44]. As\\nshown in Table 2, large-scale CCS facilities that are cur-\\nrently in operation mostly adopt the separation with sol-\\nvents method, i.e., the absorption method.\\nSolvents for CO2 capture can be physical solvents such\\nas methanol that absorb CO2 based on Henry’s law or\\nTable 1 The amount of CO2 used in 2012\\nProduced compound\\nCO2 used (Mt/y)\\nUrea\\n114\\nMethanol\\n8\\nFormaldehyde\\n3.5\\nDimethyl ether\\n3\\nTert-butyl methyl ether\\n1.5\\nPolycarbonates\\n0.01\\nOrganic carbonates\\n0.005\\nInorganic carbonates\\nca. 50\\nAdopted from ref. [13]\\nH. Yamada\\nchemical solvents that absorb CO2 through chemical reac-\\ntions [45]. Physical solvents are suitable for the separation\\nof CO2 with high pressure. Chemical solvents with rela-\\ntively low reactivity towards CO2 are used for gas with\\nhigh-pressure CO2, such as syngas, while those with\\nhigh reactivity can be used for gas with low-pressure CO2,\\nsuch as coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas.\\nAmong the large-scale facilities shown in Table 2, nine\\nCCS projects use amine-based chemical solvents such as\\nmonoethanolamine (MEA) [46] and MDEA, while six\\nprojects use physical solvents [47]. As for the sorbent-based\\nand membrane separation methods, both have been used in\\none CCS project each since 2013. A sorbent-based vacuum\\nswing adsorption process was retroﬁtted in steam methane\\nreformers to separate CO2 from the gas stream with a\\ncapacity of approximately 1 Mt-CO2/y for EOR in Texas\\n[27, 32]. The CO2-EOR project at offshore oil and gas ﬁelds\\nin Brazil has installed UOP Separex membrane systems,\\nwhich comprise polymeric membrane materials for solution\\ndiffusion-based gas permeation. This is carried out to\\nremove CO2 and water for natural gas processing at\\napproximately 7 Mm3/d [27, 30, 32].\\nFigure 1 shows the breakdown of the CO2 captured in the\\nnineteen large-scale CCS facilities. The breakdown was\\ncalculated by summing the medians from the GCCSI data-\\nbase [27]. The total CO2 capacity of all nineteen large-scale\\nfacilities reached 35 Mt/y, far less than the amount\\nof reduction required to mitigate global warming [8].\\nTo accelerate the deployment of CCUS over the next decade,\\nCO2 capture using amine-based solvents, which is the most\\neffective and mature technology, is of paramount impor-\\ntance. In addition, further process optimization, scaling, and\\ndeployments for next-generation CO2 capture technologies,\\nincluding sorbent-based and membrane separation technol-\\nogies [48], are expected in the coming years.\\nAmine-CO2 reactions\\nGenerally, a CO2 capture process consists of two steps: (i)\\nseparation of CO2 from a gas mixture through a selective\\nTable 2 Large-scale CCS\\nfacilities in operation\\nName\\nCountry\\nStart\\nIndustry\\nCapture\\nBoundary Dam\\nCanada\\n2014\\nPower\\nCansolv\\nAmine solvents for low pressure CO2\\nPetra Nova\\nUSA\\n2017\\nPower\\nKS-1\\nCNPC Jilin\\nChina\\n2018\\nNG\\nMEA\\nSleipner\\nNorway\\n1996\\nNG\\nMDEA\\nAmine solvents for high pressure CO2\\nSnøhvit\\nNorway\\n2008\\nNG\\nPZ/MDEA\\nUthmaniyah\\nSaudi Arabia\\n2015\\nNG\\nAmine\\nQuest\\nCanada\\n2015\\nHydrogen\\nPZ/MDEA\\nAbu Dhabi\\nUAE\\n2016\\nIron, Steel\\nMDEA\\nGorgon\\nAustralia\\n2019\\nNG\\nPZ/MDEA\\nTerrell\\nUSA\\n1972\\nNG\\nC4H6O3\\nPhysical solvents for high pressure CO2\\nShute Creek\\nUSA\\n1986\\nNG\\nSelexol\\nGreat Plains\\nUSA\\n2000\\nNG\\nRectisol\\nCentury\\nUSA\\n2010\\nSynfuels\\nSelexol\\nLost Cabin\\nUSA\\n2013\\nNG\\nSelexol\\nCoffeyville\\nUSA\\n2013\\nFertilizer\\nSelexol\\nEnid Fertilizer\\nUSA\\n1982\\nFertilizer\\nK2CO3\\nOthers\\nAir Products\\nUSA\\n2013\\nHydrogen\\nAdsorbent\\nPetrobras\\nBrazil\\n2013\\nNG\\nMembrane\\nIllinois\\nUSA\\n2017\\nEthanol\\nCapture less\\nBased on the GCCSI database [26, 27] and additional surveys [28–36].

The material can be\\nreused for CO2 capture by sequentially repeating steps (i)\\nand\\n(ii).\\nTo\\ncapture\\nCO2\\nefﬁciently,\\none\\npractical\\nrequirement is “reversibility.” For example, aqueous\\nsodium hydroxide solutions are not suitable for CO2 cap-\\nture, as the strong reaction can be regarded as irreversible\\nunder normal conditions. Needless to say, materials that\\ninteract weakly with CO2 are also not suitable for the\\ncapture process, as the low selectivity and capacity lead to\\npoor CO2 capture performance. In this respect, another\\nimportant requirement for a reaction to capture CO2 is\\n“moderation [48].”\\nAmines are the most widely utilized chemicals in a\\nvariety of CO2 capture materials, including chemical sol-\\nvents [49], porous sorbents [50], gels [51], and membranes\\n[52]. The main reason for this is that the moderate inter-\\naction allows for an effective separation of amine and CO2\\nvia a reversible reaction. It should be noted that the optimal\\nreactivity depends on the surrounding molecular environ-\\nment, operating temperature, pressure, gas composition,\\nrequired capture performance, and other factors. Due to\\nlarge variations in amine molecular structure, the CO2\\ncapture material within the range of moderate reactivity can\\nbe further adjusted based on the amine structure and/or\\nblending amines. Such adjusting has been one of the central\\nthemes in the development of CO2 capture technologies\\n[22, 39, 48].\\nAmines can be classiﬁed into three types based on the\\nnumber of hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogen atom.\\nPrimary, secondary, and tertiary amines contain nitrogen\\natoms that are covalently attached to two hydrogen atoms,\\none\\nhydrogen\\natom,\\nand\\nonly\\nnon-hydrogen\\natoms,\\nrespectively.\\nChemical\\nreactivity\\nis\\noften\\nnoted\\nas\\ndecreasing in the following order: primary (−NH2) > sec-\\nondary (>NH) > tertiary (>N−). However, this order varies\\ndepending on the electronic and steric effects of all sub-\\nstituents attached to the nitrogen atoms [48]. Chemical\\nreactivity is also governed by the reaction type and reaction\\nﬁeld [53]. For instance, the pKa values representing\\nBrønsted basicity in aqueous solutions for ethylamine,\\ndiethylamine, and triethylamine are 10.63, 10.98, and\\n10.65, respectively [54].\\nPrimary and secondary amines react with CO2 to form\\nthe carbamate anion and protonated amine as follows\\n[55, 56]:\\nR1R2NH þ CO2 þ B$R1R2NCOO\\x02 þ BHþ\\nð1Þ\\nwhere Rn represents the substituent, such as an alkyl group,\\nand B is the Brønsted base, such as another amine in the\\nsystem. Carbamic acid may be produced as an intermediate\\nor byproduct of the amine-CO2 reaction depending on\\nthe substituents and reaction ﬁeld [57].\\nR1R2NH þ CO2$R1R2NCOOH\\nð2Þ\\nSome amines with hydrophobic phenyl groups absorb\\nCO2 in the form of carbamic acid rather than carbamate\\nanions [58]. In the presence of water, another major reaction\\nproduct is the bicarbonate anion [55, 56].\\nR1R2R3N þ CO2 þ H2O$HCO\\x02\\n3 þ R1R2R3NHþ\\nð3Þ\\nSimilarly, the alkyl carbonate anion may form in the\\npresence of alkanols [59].\\nAs substituents drastically affect amine properties, sub-\\nstituent effects have been studied extensively for the\\ndevelopment of efﬁcient amine-based materials for CO2\\ncapture [56, 60–64]. Steric hindrance and hydroxy sub-\\nstituent groups often signiﬁcantly affect the performance of\\nCO2 capture [65]. For example, there are reports that the use\\nof isopropyl groups improves amine-based CO2 capture\\nefﬁciency for methods with solvents [66, 67], sorbents [68],\\nand membranes [69].\\nThe most well-known intermediate in the amine-CO2\\nreaction is zwitterion [70, 71].\\nR1R2NH þ CO2$R1R2NHþCOO\\x02\\nð4Þ\\nIn aqueous solutions of alkanolamines such as MEA,\\ncarbamate formation (1) occurs via a two-step mechanism,\\nwhere the zwitterion ﬁrst forms followed by its deproto-\\nnation [72, 73]. Generally, in comparison to other reactions\\n(2) and (3), zwitterion formation (4) exhibits faster reaction\\nkinetics. Therefore, reaction (4) is signiﬁcant for the mass\\ntransfer of CO2. On the other hand, a bicarbonate anion has\\nthe advantage of high diffusivity because of its small size as\\nwell as its low energy requirements during the regeneration\\nprocess [48].\\nFactors affecting the reactions\\nThere are a wide range of factors that affect amine-CO2\\nreactions in CO2 capture processes. In this section, we focus\\non CO2 partial pressure and the reaction ﬁeld.\\nThe formations of carbamate anion (1) and bicarbonate\\nanion (3) are sometimes compared in terms of stoichio-\\nmetry. In aqueous amine solutions, the former consumes\\n2 mols of amine to 1 mol of CO2, while the latter requires\\n1 mol of amine to 1 mol of CO2. However, stoichiometry is\\nonly one of the factors that affects the absorption capacity of\\nCO2. The basic strength, molecular weight, and surrounding\\nenvironment of amines have a larger inﬂuence on the\\nH. Yamada\\nabsorption capacity [53, 56]. For instance, the traditional 30\\nwt% MEA aqueous solution [46], which predominantly\\nforms the carbamate anion for CO2 absorption, exhibits\\nrelatively high CO2 capacity under post-combustion capture\\nconditions due to the strong basicity and low molecular\\nweight of MEA.\\nFurthermore, the branching ratio of the carbamate anion,\\nbicarbonate anion, and other chemical forms changes based\\non CO2 pretrial pressure for any primary and secondary\\namines. Figure 2 is a schematic of the distribution of car-\\nbamate, bicarbonate, alkyl carbonate, and physically absor-\\nbed CO2 as a function of the CO2 partial pressure in an\\nalkanolamine−CO2−water system. The schematic was based\\non quantitative measurements at equilibrium [59, 67, 74].\\nUnder lower CO2 partial pressures, the strongest reaction was\\npredominantly carbamate formation. As the CO2 partial\\npressure increases, the concentration of carbamate anion\\nincreases up to the point where it starts to saturate. Subse-\\nquently, it starts to drop, while the concentration of bicar-\\nbonate anion increases steadily. At the molecular level,\\nincreasing the proton concentration in the solution facilitates\\nthe conversion of carbamate to bicarbonate [75].\\nR1R2NCOO\\x02 þ H2O$HCO\\x02\\n3 þ R1R2NH\\nð5Þ\\nThe general trend shown in Fig. 2 can be explained by Le\\nChatelier’s principle [76].\\nThe effect of the surrounding environments, i.e., reaction\\nﬁelds, is also an important factor that governs amine-CO2\\nreactions, as was previously studied by the author using\\nquantum chemistry [53]. In reactions (1) and (3), the pro-\\nducts are charged species, i.e., carbamate, bicarbonate, and\\naminium ions. The solvation energy of such charged species\\ndepends on the polarity of the surrounding media. Thus,\\nwater, a solvent with high polarity, can signiﬁcantly stabi-\\nlize these charged species. Notably, water molecules are\\nalso able to stabilize the charged species due to the\\nhydrogen-bond effect. Recently, a computational study\\nrevealed that solvents with higher hydrogen bond capacity\\nfacilitate zwitterion formation [77].\\nAmine-containing polymeric membranes\\nTo\\ndevelop\\nnext-generation\\nCO2\\ncapture\\ntechnology,\\nmembrane separation is a promising strategy with numerous\\nadvantages: low capital investment, small footprint, ease of\\nscaling up, low energy requirement, simple operation, and\\nlow environmental impact [78–81]. As mentioned pre-\\nviously, a polymeric membrane system was installed in a\\nlarge-scale CCS facility in 2013 [27, 30, 32]. In addition,\\nseveral projects using amine-based polymeric membrane\\nsystems for CO2 separation are in the pilot phase [82–84].\\nIn addition to CCS, polymeric membrane systems have\\nbeen commercialized for natural gas sweetening, although\\nthey only occupy 5% of the market today [83]. Membranes for\\nnatural gas sweetening are usually made from cellulose acetate\\nand polyimide, which typically show a CO2/CH4 selectivity of\\n15−30. Such polymeric membranes separate gases according\\nto the solution-diffusion mechanism, where gas molecules ﬁrst\\ndissolve in a polymer at the interface and then diffuse across\\nthe membrane. One of the challenges of gas separation using\\npolymers is deﬁned by the “Robeson’s upper bound [85, 86]”\\nrelationship. Generally, the solution-diffusion mechanism\\naffects the trade-off between permeability and selectivity and\\nis governed by the upper bound [87].\\nAn amine in a polymer membrane can be a CO2 transport\\n“carrier” through the chemical reaction [88]. In particular,\\nCO2 will ﬁrst react with the amine carrier at the interface,\\nand then, the reacted CO2, e.g., HCO3\\n−, will diffuse across\\nthe membrane, where regeneration occurs due to low CO2\\npartial pressure. As such, a membrane, namely, a “facili-\\ntated transport membrane” chemically selects and transports\\nCO2 in addition to the contribution of physical polymer\\nsolution diffusion, and it can achieve both high permeability\\nand selectivity beyond Robeson’s upper bound [52, 89].\\nThe CO2 separation mechanism facilitated by the trans-\\nport polymeric membrane is illustrated in Fig. 3. For this\\ntype of membrane, H2O is necessary for high CO2 capture\\nperformance. It can be sourced from ﬂue gas in the case of\\npost-combustion CO2 capture. Moreover, the water absor-\\nbency of the polymer also governs the capture performance.\\nAs shown in Fig. 3, CO2 will pass through the polymer\\nlayer based on both solution diffusion and carrier-mediated\\ndiffusion, while other gases, such as nitrogen (N2), O2, CH4,\\nand H2, can only pass through via a solution-diffusion\\nmechanism. A thin selective polymer layer, high diffusion\\ncoefﬁcient, and steep gradient of carrier concentrations\\nacross the polymer will positively affect the CO2 permeate\\nﬂux, while low solubilities and diffusion coefﬁcients for\\nother gases in the polymer will lead to high selectivity for\\nConcentration (arb.)\\nCO2 pressure (arb.)\\n Bicarbonate \\n Carbamate\\n Alkyl carbonate\\n Physically dissolved CO2\\nFig. 2 Schematic distribution of the forms of CO2 absorbed in an\\nalkanolamine−CO2−water system\\nAmine-based capture of CO2 for utilization and storage\\nCO2. For such facilitated transport membranes, poly(ami-\\ndoamine),\\npoly(vinyl\\nalcohol)\\n(PVA),\\npolyallylamine\\n(PAA), and polyvinyl amine (PVAm) are often applied as\\nselective layers with/without amine additives [48, 83].\\nHägg et al. [90, 91] successfully developed facilitated\\ntransport membranes using PVAm as a ﬁxed-site carrier\\n(FSC). They evaluated the suitability of FSC for CO2\\ntransport by examining the effects of feed pressure, relative\\nhumidity, acidity of polymer solution (pH), and other fac-\\ntors. They found that the formation of bicarbonate, i.e.,\\nreaction (3) or (5), followed by diffusion is crucial for\\noptimal FSC membrane performance [89–94]. Apart from\\ntheir studies, facilitated transport membranes are usually\\nused under humidiﬁed conditions. As described earlier, both\\ncarbamate and bicarbonate anions are stabilized by the\\nwater solvents. Furthermore, membranes prepared using the\\nacidic polymer solution consisting of PVAm hydrochloride\\nalso exhibit moderate selectivity and permeability for CO2\\n[92]. Therefore, improved transport of CO2 through humi-\\ndiﬁcation is not solely due to the formation of bicarbonate.\\nCarbamate formation, CO2 partial pressure and physical\\nsolution should also be considered.\\nAs an alternative to FSCs, mobile carriers such as MEA\\nand MDEA have been proposed to improve carrier mobility\\nby incorporating them into a suitable polymer matrix such\\nas PVA [95, 96]. Taniguchi et al. [97] found that the\\nhydroxy group of incorporated alkanolamines could sig-\\nniﬁcantly facilitate the transport of CO2 due to the intra-\\nmolecular\\nhydrogen\\nbonding\\neffect.\\nIn\\naddition\\nto\\nconventional alkanolamines, diamines are also a good\\nalternative for the transport of CO2 [98, 99]. Wang et al.\\n[99] reported that by incorporating piperazine (PZ) into\\nPVAm, the membrane exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher CO2\\nseparation performance than that without PZ.\\nThe effect of diamines is often characterized solely based\\non the number of amino groups. However, the diamine\\nreaction is more complex than the monoamine reaction.\\nOwing to the signiﬁcant difference between the pKa1 and\\npKa2 values in diamines [100], the respective roles must be\\nassigned to two amino groups to better understand the CO2\\ncapture mechanism. Previously, Bishnoi and Rochelle [101]\\nconﬁrmed the presence of signiﬁcant amounts of PZ zwit-\\nterions in the PZ−CO2−water system. With spectroscopic\\nspeciation, however, it was difﬁcult to clearly distinguish\\nthe two isomers for PZ zwitterion. The author of this review\\nrevealed the possible reactions in forming N,N’ zwitterions\\nof PZ, as shown in Fig. 4, by performing density functional\\ntheory calculations. The results from Gibbs free energy\\ncalculations with the SMD/B3PW91/6–311++G(d,p) the-\\nory conﬁrmed that the N,N’-zwitterion of PZ is more stable\\nthan its two isomers, N,N-zwitterion and carbamic acid of\\nPZ, by 63 kJ/mol and 33 kJ/mol, respectively. This analysis\\npredicts that it will accumulate in the system by CO2\\nabsorption. More importantly, a stable zwitterion is able to\\nbehave both as a Brønsted acid and base. As mentioned\\npreviously, a Brønsted acid/base is essential for CO2 cap-\\nture. Moreover, the transfer of proton/hydroxide ions is\\ncritical for the capture of CO2. Therefore, these ﬁndings for\\nthe PZ−CO2 system indicate that the N,N’ zwitterion of PZ\\nis a key component that promotes CO2 solution-transport-\\ndissolution, enhancing CO2 capture performance.\\nAmine-containing polymeric membrane technology for\\nCCUS is now in a pilot testing phase [84]. He et al. [82]\\ndeveloped a pilot installation using PVAm-based FSC hollow\\nﬁber membranes at the Tiller plant in Norway. The test results\\nfrom the feed CO2 concentration ranging from 9.5% to 12.4%\\nof one stage were obtained as the basis for an optimized two-\\nstage process for actual CO2 capture. A membrane pilot at the\\nNorcem Cement factory in Norway was also developed for\\nCO2 capture from ﬂue gas with a high CO2 content of\\napproximately 17% [102]. In this test, commercial modules\\nfrom Air Products were utilized. This enabled good stability\\nwithout signiﬁcant performance change when exposed to SO2\\nand NOx. Recently, Salim et al. [103] developed pilot-scale\\nspiral-wound modules of PAA-based facilitated transport\\nmembranes and tested them at the National Carbon Capture\\nCenter in the United States. The ﬁeld test results for the\\nmodules showed good potential for post-combustion CO2\\ncapture from coal-ﬁred power plants.\\nSummary and perspective\\nThis study focused on CO2 capture technologies that have\\nalready been used at large-scale CCS facilities, amine-CO2\\nchemical reactions for CO2 capture, and the key mechan-\\nisms affecting CO2 separation performance.

As a result, the absorption efficiency of the amines was significantly increased resulting in higher CO2 \\nuptake and faster absorption kinetics for the AIMGs compared to the conventional bulk amine solutions. \\nFurthermore, by ‘locking’ the amine solutions in the microgel particles, the corrosion and foaming issues of \\namine solutions could be substantially mitigated. Therefore, the amine solutions which have higher concen\\xad\\ntrations than the commercial counterparts could be used in the preparation of AIMGs.

        "Title": "'Anomalous Facile Carbamate Formation at High Stripping\\nTemperatures from Carbon Dioxide Reaction with 2‑Amino-2-\\nmethyl-1-propanol in Aqueous Solution\\n'",
        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: Based on ﬁrst-principles simulations, we present that carbamate\\nformation can be kinetically more favorable than bicarbonate formation at high\\nstripping temperatures (>400 K) from the reaction between CO2 and 2-amino-\\n2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) in aqueous solution, while the latter tends to be\\npredominant during CO2 capture at low absorber temperatures (<330 K). This\\nﬁnding oﬀers explanation for the intriguing observation of oxazolidinone\\nformation as the major product of AMP degradation, which is known to occur\\nvia carbamate, as also seen from thermal degradation of aqueous\\nmonoethanolamine (MEA) in CO2 capture processes. From ab initio\\nmolecular dynamics simulations coupled with metadynamics sampling, the\\nfree-energy barrier for carbamate formation is predicted to substantially\\ndecrease from 11.7 to 5.5 kcal/mol with increasing temperature from 313 to\\n413 K in 25 wt % AMP solution whereas that for bicarbonate formation\\nincreases from 9.6 to 12.4 kcal/mol. Likewise, the predicted free-energy barrier\\nfor carbamate formation in aqueous MEA also decreases with temperature but is signiﬁcantly less compared to the AMP case.\\nFurther analysis demonstrates that the increase of temperature results in enhancing the disruption of the hydrogen bond network\\naround the basic nitrogen atom of AMP (or MEA), allowing more facile CO2 access to form carbamate. Our work provides new\\ninsight on the strong temperature dependence of the CO2 capture mechanism and kinetics in aqueous solutions of amines, arising\\nfrom changes in the hydrogen bond structure and dynamics around amines.\\nKEYWORDS: 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, CO2 capture mechanism, hydrogen bond dynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics,\\nmetadynamics\\nreaction is initiated primarily by proton abstraction from\\nH2O by AMP. Both CNN−H and CNC−O are 1 at the ﬁnal state\\n(FS), indicating that the AMP + H2O + CO2 →AMPH+ +\\nHCO3\\n−reaction is completed. According to the computed\\nfree-energy surface in Figure 1, the reaction barrier for the\\nbicarbonate formation is estimated to be 9.6 kcal/mol at 313\\nK, which is slightly higher than 8.1 kcal/mol from previous\\nmetadynamics simulations9 with diﬀerent CVs, and increases\\nFigure 1. Free-energy surface (ΔA in kcal/mol) for bicarbonate\\nformation via amine-catalyzed hydrolysis, i.e., AMP + CO2 →AMPH+\\n+ HCO3\\n−, predicted by metadynamics simulations at 313 K. Shown at\\nthe right are the structures of the initial (IS), transition (TS), and ﬁnal\\n(FS) states in which the blue, red, gray, and white balls represent N,\\nO, C, and H atoms, respectively.\\nACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering\\npubs.acs.org/journal/ascecg\\nResearch Article\\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c07203\\nACS Sustainable Chem. Eng. 2020, 8, 18671−18677\\n18672\\nto 12.4 kcal/mol at 413 K. The increased free-energy barrier,\\nalbeit not substantially, suggests that the AMP-catalyzed\\nbicarbonate formation could be kinetically hindered, to a\\ncertain extent, with increasing the solution temperature.\\nWe then also evaluated the temperature dependence of the\\nfree-energy proﬁle for a competing reaction leading to\\ncarbamate formation. Here, the direct reaction of CO2 with\\nAMP forming a zwitterionic intermediate, i.e., AMP + CO2 →\\nAMP+CO2\\n−, is only considered using the distance between N\\nof AMP and C of CO2 (dC−N) as a CV. The free-energy barrier\\nfor the carbamate formation is primarily determined by the\\nzwitterion formation since the successive deprotonation\\nreaction may occur with no sizable barrier. Hence, the single\\nCV, dC−N, should be suitable and suﬃcient to describe the free-\\nenergy variation along the corresponding reaction coordinate.\\nAs shown in Figure 2, a relatively large dC−N of 2.7 Å at the\\nIS allows separation of CO2 and AMP with no intermolecular\\nbonding interaction between the lone pair on N (in AMP) and\\nelectrophilic C atom (in CO2). As dC−N decreases, the C−O\\nbonds of CO2 are elongated while the CO2 structure becomes\\nsubstantially bent due to the electron transfer from the N lone\\npair of AMP to CO2.31 dC−N is 2.1 Å at the TS and further\\ndecreases to 1.7 Å at the FS. From the short-lived zwitterion at\\nthe FS, a proton tends to be released almost instantaneously to\\nform carbamate. At 313 K, a predicted free-energy barrier of\\n11.7 kcal/mol is higher than 9.6 kcal/mol for bicarbonate\\nformation. However, interestingly, the carbamate formation\\nbarrier drops signiﬁcantly to 5.5 kcal/mol while the\\nbicarbonate formation barrier increases to 12.4 kcal/mol as\\nthe solution temperature is increased to 413 K. The results\\nclearly demonstrate that carbamate formation can be kineti-\\ncally more favorable than bicarbonate formation at high\\nstripping temperatures (∼413 K). For comparison, we also\\ncalculated the free-energy barriers for carbamate formation in\\naqueous MEA using metadynamics simulations with the same\\nprocedure as the AMP case; the resulting barriers are 7.9 and\\n6.8 kcal/mol at 313 and 413 K, respectively (see Figure S5).\\nWe further performed AIMD simulations to verify the\\ntemperature dependence of the major kinetic pathway for CO2\\ncapture in aqueous AMP. In each simulation, 25 H2O, 1 AMP,\\nand 1 CO2 molecules were placed in a cubic box of side 10.12\\nÅ with periodic boundary conditions. During about a 40 ps\\nsimulation, we only observed a carbamate formation at 413 K\\nvia the direct reaction between AMP and CO2, as illustrated in\\nFigure 3. The electrophilic C of CO2 is attacked by the lone\\npair of N in AMP [(a) →(b)] followed by short-lived\\nzwitterionic intermediate formation [(b) →(c)] and\\nsubsequent deprotonation [(c) →(d)]; here, the proton\\nreleased from the zwitterion is abstracted by the carbamate\\ngroup to form carbamic acid, but the protonation of free AMP,\\nif it is available, is thermodynamically more favorable, i.e., 2\\nAMP + CO2 →AMPCOO−+ AMPH+.7 At 313 K, as\\nillustrated in Figure S6, one H2O molecule remains bound to\\nN of AMP for 11 ps, hindering CO2 accessibility, which has\\nalso been well demonstrated in previous studies.7−9 Due to the\\nlimited simulation time, bicarbonate formation was not\\nobserved from six independent runs at both 313 and 413 K.\\nNonetheless, our simulation is suﬃcient to prove relative ease\\nof carbamate formation at 413 K, which appears to be closely\\nrelated to the dynamics of H2O molecules surrounding the\\n−NH2 group. In the following section, we examine how\\ntemperature aﬀects the dynamics of the interaction between\\nthe −NH2 group of AMP and surrounding H2O molecules,\\nwith a comparison to the MEA case.\\nHydrogen Bond Structure and Dynamics. Previous\\nstudies13,32 demonstrate that, compared to the MEA case, the\\nN atom of AMP forms a stronger hydrogen bond (HB) with\\nan adjacent H2O molecule. The relatively strongly bound H2O\\nis thought to be mainly responsible for the suppression of\\ncarbamate formation by hindering the accessibility of CO2 to\\nthe N site while facilitating bicarbonate formation via base-\\ncatalyzed hydration of CO2.7−9 Hence, we ﬁrst evaluated the\\ndisruption of the HB between N in amine and H in\\nneighboring H2O by calculating a continuous HB autocorre-\\nlation function, S(t), which describes the probability that the\\nhydrogen-bonded N⋯H pair remains bonded at all times up\\nto time t. The average HB lifetime, τS, is obtained by\\nintegrating S(t). A more detailed description of the calculations\\ncan be found in the Supporting Information.\\nFigure 2.

Eng. 2020, 8, 18671−18677\\n18673\\nAs summarized in Figure 4, a predicted τS of 14.5 ps in the\\nAMP solution is about twice longer than 6.9 ps, as predicted in\\nthe MEA solution at 313 K, consistent with previous\\nstudies.7,32 However, the increase of solution temperature to\\n413 K results in a signiﬁcant reduction of τS yielding 3.3 ps in\\nthe AMP case, which is even smaller than 5.1 ps in the MEA\\ncase. The reduced τS may adversely aﬀect the proton\\nabstraction from an adjacent H2O molecule, which could\\nexplain the increase in the predicted barrier for bicarbonate\\nformation from 9.6 to 12.4 kcal/mol with increasing temper-\\nature from 313 to 413 K (see Figure 1). Moreover, the N site\\nof AMP could become more available for the direct reaction\\nwith CO2 to form carbamate. In addition, the HB network\\naround −NH2 of AMP is predicted to be more disrupted at\\n413 K, even when compared to the MEA case (vide infra). As a\\nresult, CO2 accessibility for binding to the N site of AMP\\nwould be less hindered, allowing for facile carbamate formation\\nas well as demonstrated by the signiﬁcant decrease of the\\ncorresponding free-energy barrier (see Figure 2).\\nWe further analyzed the dynamics of H2O molecules\\nsurrounding MEA and AMP through computation of changes\\nin the diﬀusivity and dipole moment with varying temper-\\natures. Table 1 summarizes calculated diﬀusion coeﬃcients\\n(DH2O) and average dipole moments for H2O in aqueous MEA\\nand AMP solutions at 313 and 413 K; the calculated values of\\nDH2O and the dipole moment for pure water are also included\\nfor comparison. Here, DH2O is estimated from a mean squared\\ndisplacement (MSD) using the Einstein relation DH2O =\\n⟨MSD⟩/6t [= ⟨| Ri(t) −Ri(0)|2⟩/6t], where Ri(t) denotes the\\nposition of atom i at time t, and the angle bracket indicates an\\nensemble average. For each system, ⟨MSD⟩was determined\\nfrom an AIMD production run of 25 ps after a 5 ps\\nequilibration run; the plots of MSD versus t are presented in\\nFigure S7 (Supporting Information). At 313 K, DH2O tends to\\ndecrease from 2.1 × 10−5 cm2/s in pure water to 2.0 × 10−5\\nand 1.7 × 10−5 cm2/s in the MEA and AMP solutions,\\nrespectively. On the other hand, H2O is predicted to become\\nmore mobile in the AMP solution (DH2O = 3.8 × 10−5 cm2/s)\\nat 413 K, as compared to the cases of the MEA solution (DH2O\\n= 3.2 × 10−5 cm2/s) and pure water (DH2O = 3.1 × 10−5 cm2/\\ns).\\nIt is well known that molecular solutes exert a strong eﬀect\\non the structure and dynamics of water surrounding them\\nthrough perturbation of H-bonding networks. At low temper-\\natures, the H-bond disruption may cause an enhancement of\\nlocal structural ordering and a decrease in mobility. In\\nparticular, the H2O molecules surrounding −NH2 of AMP\\nare conﬁned to a certain degree by the hydrophobic methyl\\ngroups, leading to the formation of strong H-bonds between\\nthe −NH2 group and neighboring H2O molecules; the\\nresulting mobility restriction can be well demonstrated by\\nthe enhanced structural rigidity. Therefore, as presented in\\nTable 1, the decrease of DH2O in the AMP solution at 313 K, as\\ncompared to pure water, tends to be more substantial than that\\nin the MEA solution. As the solution temperature increases,\\nthe enhanced perturbation of H-bonding networks may\\ncontribute to an increase in DH2O. The temperature depend-\\nence of structural disruption is well expected to become\\nstronger in the presence of molecular solutes; this can explain\\nthe greater increase of DH2O with temperature in the MEA and\\nAMP solutions, as compared to the case of pure water. Our\\nresults also imply that the extent of H-bond disruption would\\nbe greater in the AMP solution due mainly to the hydrophobic\\nmethyl groups, yielding higher DH2O, as compared to the MEA\\nand pure water cases.\\nTo better understand the eﬀects of the solvent and\\ntemperature on the H-bond structure and dynamics, we\\ncalculated the dipole moment of H2O molecules in pure water\\nand aqueous solutions of MEA and AMP at two diﬀerent\\ntemperatures (313 and 413 K) using the maximally localized\\nWannier function (MLWF) method.33 The centers of MLWFs\\ncan be treated as quasiparticles, and the molecular dipole\\nmoment can be computed in a classical way by integrating the\\npositions and electrical charges of the nuclei and MLWF\\ncenters of H2O.34 Here, MLWF centers were evaluated at\\nevery ﬁfth AIMD step (2.5 FS). The description of the\\ncalculations are explained in more detail in the Supporting\\nInformation.\\nThe dipole moment of a H2O molecule arises from the\\nelectronegativity diﬀerence between O and H and is enhanced\\nby forming H-bonds. The enhancement of the dipole moment\\ndepends on the local H-bond structure. At room temperature,\\nthe average dipole moment of H2O molecules in pure water is\\ncalculated to be 2.94 Debye (D), which is close to an\\nexperimental value of 2.91 D35 and in good agreement with\\nprevious theoretical studies.36−39 Figure 5 shows dipole\\nmoment distributions of water in the MEA and AMP solutions,\\ngiving average values of 2.81/2.87 and 2.66/2.55 D in the\\nformer/latter case at 313 and 413 K, respectively. For both\\nAMP and MEA solutions, the dipole moment decreases as\\ncompared to pure water and further decreases with increasing\\ntemperature. The dipole moment decrease is apparently due to\\nthe reduction of the H-bond strength arising from H-bond\\ndisruption. At 313 K, a slightly higher dipole moment of 2.87\\nFigure 4.

On the other hand, the relatively smaller\\ndipole moment at 413 K implies that the H-bonds are more\\ndisrupted in the AMP solution than in the MEA solution,\\nconsistent with the analysis of H2O diﬀusion.\\nTemperature Eﬀect on CO2 Accessibility. To evaluate\\nthe temperature eﬀect on CO2 accessibility, we computed the\\nradial distribution function between N in AMP or MEA and C\\nof CO2, which is given by g(r) = ⟨n(r, r + dr)/4πr2ρdr⟩, where\\nn(r, r + dr) is the number of C in a spherical shell of radius r\\nwith a thickness dr from the reference N, or vice versa, and ρ is\\nthe bulk number density. The g(r) for each case was obtained\\nfrom an average of ﬁve independent systems with diﬀerent\\ninitial conﬁgurations. As shown in Figure 6, the lower tail of\\ng(r) is substantially shifted to the right as MEA is replaced with\\nAMP at 313 K, indicating that the CO2 access to the N site is\\nsigniﬁcantly inhibited in the AMP solution, as discussed earlier.\\nWith increasing temperature to 413 K, however, the g(r) tail is\\nconsiderably shifted down and the ﬁrst peak intensity becomes\\nmuch greater in the AMP case, implying that CO2 more easily\\napproaches and favorably exists around the N site; the opposite\\ntrend is predicted for the MEA case. This analysis\\ndemonstrates that the increase of temperature may allow facile\\nCO2 access to form carbamate, which is primarily responsible\\nfor the strong temperature dependence of the free-energy\\nbarrier for carbamate formation in aqueous AMP, as presented\\nin Figure 2. Our results highlight that carbamate formation can\\nbe kinetically more favorable than bicarbonate formation at\\nhigh stripping temperatures, while the latter tends to be\\npredominant in relatively low absorber temperatures.\\n■CONCLUSIONS\\nWe examined the temperature dependence of the preferred\\nreaction mechanism and kinetics for CO2 capture in aqueous\\nAMP. The free-energy barriers for two competing reactions\\nleading to bicarbonate or carbamate formation were predicted\\nat high stripping and low absorber temperatures using AIMD\\nmetadynamics simulations. To better understand the strong\\ntemperature eﬀect, we also analyzed the dynamics of local\\nhydrogen-bonding structures around each amine at varying\\ntemperatures and its impact on CO2 accessibility to the\\namine’s N atom. Our important ﬁndings are summarized as\\nfollows:\\n• The free-energy barrier for carbamate formation is\\npredicted to considerably decrease from 11.7 to 5.5\\nkcal/mol with increasing temperature from 313 to 413 K\\nin 25 wt % AMP solution at 0.5 CO2 loading. On the\\nother hand, the corresponding barrier height for\\nbicarbonate formation tends to increase from 9.6 to\\n12.4 kcal/mol. In comparison, the predicted free-energy\\nbarriers for carbamate formation in aqueous MEA are\\n7.9 and 6.8 kcal/mol at 313 and 413 K, respectively,\\nunder similar simulation conditions. The results clearly\\ndemonstrate that carbamate formation becomes easier\\nwith temperature, but the opposite trend is true for\\nbicarbonate formation. As a consequence, carbamate\\nformation can become kinetically more favorable than\\nbicarbonate formation at high stripping temperatures,\\nfrom the reaction of CO2 with AMP in aqueous solution.\\n• The lifetime of the hydrogen bond between N in AMP\\nand H in neighboring H2O was evaluated and found to\\nbe substantially reduced with temperature. At 313 K, the\\npredicted average value (τS) is 14.5 ps in the AMP\\nsolution considered, which is about twice larger than 6.9\\nps in the corresponding MEA solution. However, the\\nincrease of temperature to 413 K results in a signiﬁcant\\nreduction of τS yielding 3.3 ps in the AMP case, which is\\neven smaller than 5.1 ps in the MEA case. The reduced\\nτS may adversely aﬀect bicarbonate formation via the\\nbase-catalyzed hydration of CO2, explaining the barrier\\nincrease with temperature in aqueous AMP.\\n• Our further analysis based on H2O diﬀusivity and dipole\\nmoment clariﬁes stronger disruption of the hydrogen\\nbond networks around AMP compared to MEA at 413\\nK, attributed primarily to the hydrophobic methyl\\ngroups. As a result, the N atom of AMP becomes\\nmore accessible to CO2 for carbamate formation,\\nresponsible for the signiﬁcant reduction in the\\ncorresponding barrier height.\\nOur work highlights that CO2 reaction dynamics in aqueous\\nsolutions of amines can be strongly aﬀected by the temper-\\nature-dependent hydrogen bond structure and dynamics\\nFigure 5.

The \\nthermodynamically preferred formation of EDACOO-/EDAH+ (R2) over EDACOOH (R1) \\ncan be understood by the chemical intuition that a primary amine is more basic than a \\ncarbamate.38 Hence, in perspective of thermodynamics, the proton would favorably remain \\nbonded to N in EDA to form the EDACOO-/EDAH+ pair in aqueous solution, instead of O \\nof carbamate to form EDACOOH. Nonetheless, EDACOOH formation is also expected to \\nbe substantial at high CO2 loadings in the stripper where the concentration of EDACOO- \\nis much higher than that of free EDA at dynamic equilibrium. Moreover, the relative \\nthermodynamic favorability of R1 and R2 depends on local environment. For instance, in \\nthe gas phase, ΔGgas for R2 is predicted to be much higher (\\uf0bb 137.0 kcal/mol) relative to \\nthat (\\uf0bb 16.91 kcal/mol) for R1 (see Supporting Information for further details). This is \\nexpectable considering that the formation of charged EDACOO-/EDAH+ pair becomes far \\nless energetically favorable than that of neutral carbamic acid in the gas phase. This implies \\nthat EDACOOH formation could be highly probable at stripper conditions in which water \\nvaporization may lead to possible lack of stabilization of EDACOO-/EDAH+, especially \\nwhen CO2 loading is still relatively high. A similar behavior has been predicted in CO2 \\ncapture by water-lean solvents.39 \\nThe formation of isocyanate from EDACOOH dehydration (R3) is predicted to be \\nendergonic by 3.1 kcal/mol.

ΔGaq are predicted to be -18.8 kcal/mol and -10.3 kcal/mol for R4 and R5, \\nrespectively, suggesting that IZD formation is thermodynamically far more favorable than \\nurea formation. The thermodynamic favorability of R4 over R5 contradicts the \\nexperimental observations that urea is a major, and IZD is a minor thermal degradation \\nproduct. This analysis clearly demonstrates that thermal degradation of CO2-loaded \\naqueous EDA solution cannot solely be explained by thermodynamics, suggesting that \\nkinetics may play a key role in determining the major degradation product. In fact, it has \\nbeen shown that the prevailing pathways for CO2 capture and degradation in aqueous amine \\nsolutions are often governed by the relative rates of competing reactions, rather than the \\nrelative stabilities of intermediates and/or products. \\nIn the following sections, we will evaluate free-energy barriers for elementary \\nreactions involved in the thermal degradation of EDA, including EDACOOH dehydration, \\nIZD formation via isocyanate cyclization, and urea formation involving isocyanate or \\nEDACOOH.\\n3.2.

Here, 30 H2O, 1 isocyanate, and 2 EDA molecules were placed \\nin a cubic periodic box with side length 10.77 Å, corresponding to about 27 wt% aqueous \\nEDA solution. For the urea formation reaction, we used the distance between electrophilic \\nC of –N=C=O and N of nearest EDA as a CV (dC-N). For the IZD formation reaction, we \\nalso used a single CV, dC-N,ring, the distance between electrophilic C of –N=C=O and basic \\nN in the terminal amine group. Since both reactions are mainly manipulated by the C-N \\nbond formation, the sole CV, dC-N (dC-N,ring), appears to be appropriate and sufficient to \\nevaluate their free-energy barriers.  \\nFor the case of urea formation in Figure 6(a), the relatively large dC-N of 3.25 Å at the \\ninitial state implies a complete separation of the C and N atoms with no significant \\ninteraction. The bond lengths of C-O and C-N with 1.23 Å and 1.21 Å, respectively, in –\\nN=C=O indicate their double bond character; due to high electronegativities of N and O \\nrelative to those of C, the isocyanate group may form two resonance structures i.e., -N\\uf064--\\nC\\uf064+=O \\uf0ab -N=C=O \\uf0ab -N=C\\uf064+-O\\uf064-.

We could attribute the relatively higher free-\\nenergy barrier for IZD formation largely to the tendency that reconfiguration of its chain-\\nlike structure is hindered due to the interaction between the terminal NH2 and surrounding \\nwater molecules (vide infra).   \\nWe also performed CPMD-metadynamics simulations at 44 wt% amine concentration \\n(16 water, 1 isocyanate, and 3 EDA molecules in a cubic periodic box with side length 9.77 \\nÅ) to further investigate how the free-energy barrier is influenced by the accessibility of \\nthe terminal NH2 to –N=C=O. Our simulations predict a significant decrease (increase) in \\nthe barrier height to 2.7 (16.7) kcal/mol for the case of urea (IZD) formation. This is \\napparently due to the fact that the intermolecular interaction between isocyanate and EDA \\nis enhanced by more populated EDA molecules surrounding the isocyanate, while the \\nintramolecular cyclization of isocyanate becomes more hindered. This analysis also \\nstrongly indicates that the favorability of the competing reactions is largely determined by \\nthe relative rates of the intramolecular (ring closure) and intermolecular processes, which \\ncan further be a strong function of EDA concentration in aqueous solution.\\nIn the following section, we attempt to identify the underlying mechanism responsible \\nfor the difference in the isocyanate reaction behavior in between aqueous MEA and EDA \\nsolutions.    \\n3.4.

Our previous study highlights that the intramolecular cyclization reaction \\nto OZD can be more facile than the intermolecular reaction between isocyanate and MEA \\nforming urea, although the latter is thermodynamically more favorable than the former.27 \\nUnder the nearly identical simulation conditions as the EDA case reported herein, the \\npredicted free-energy barriers for the OZD and urea formation reactions are 5.1 and 15.1 \\nkcal/mol, respectively.27 Comparing with the EDA case (yielding 12.1 and 4.8 kcal/mol, \\nrespectively), the free-energy barrier for OZD formation is lower by 7 kcal/mol, whereas \\nthat for urea formation tends to increase greater than 10 kcal/mol. The distinct difference \\ncould be attributed to the entropic effects associated with the difference in the interaction \\nof isocyanate with surrounding water molecules, as discussed in the following.   \\nGiven that the isocyanate cyclization reaction is initiated by the nucleophilic attack of \\nthe terminal base N (Nt) or O (Ot) atom, we examined the dynamics of its interaction with \\nthe isocyanate group C (Ci) atom by computing the radial distribution function (RDF) \\nbetween the Ci and Nt (or Ot) atoms in aqueous solution using AIMD simulations at 313 \\nK.

As detailed below, our further analysis \\nsuggests that the reconfiguration behavior can be strongly governed by the solvation \\ndynamics of the terminal group. \\nFigure 7.

The resulting total \\nCNs of 2.4 and 2.7 indicate that the amine group forms slightly fewer HBs than the \\nhydroxyl group, consistent with previous studies40. \\nThe RDF analysis also shows that the Nt atom is a stronger HB acceptor than the Ot \\natom, well demonstrated further by comparison of the Nt-Hw and Ot-Hw g(r) profiles in \\nwhich the first peak near 1.7 Å for the Nt-Hw pair is sharper than that near 1.8 Å for the Ot-\\nHw pair. This is not surprising given that the amine N is more basic than the hydroxyl O, \\nthereby having a stronger tendency to abstract a proton from water.

        "Title": "'Intriguing Thermal Degradation Behavior of Aqueous Piperazine for\\nCarbon Dioxide Capture: A First-Principles Assessment\\n'",
        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: Thermal degradation of aqueous piperazine (PZ) for\\nCO2 capture is experimentally known to yield a major product N-(2-\\naminoethyl)piperazine (AEP) and a minor product pair 1,1′-(1,2-\\nethanediyl)bis-piperazine (PEP) plus ethylenediamine (EDA),\\nalthough the two reactions exhibit no substantial difference in\\nthermodynamic favorability. This raises a question on factors\\naffecting the rates of key reactions involved in PZ thermal\\ndegradation. Herein, we present the underlying mechanisms of PZ\\ndegradation and the relative rates of key steps involved based on ab\\ninitio metadynamics simulations. We have identified the reaction\\nbetween PZ and protonated PZ resulting in an intermediate, 1-[2-(2-\\naminoethyl)amino]ethyl] piperazine (AEAEPZH+), and the subse-\\nquent reaction of AEAEPZH+ with PZ leading to AEP or PEP/EDA.\\nOur simulations demonstrate that the free-energy barriers for these intermolecular reactions are largely determined by the local\\nsolvation structure and dynamics of the amine species involved. We also discuss the strong effects of temperature and molecular\\nstructure on the solvation environments. While offering an explanation for preferred AEP formation in 30 wt % PZ, our work sheds\\nlight on the possibility that both the mechanism and rate of the PZ degradation reaction can be altered with changes in temperature\\nand amine concentration.\\nKEYWORDS: piperazine, thermal degradation, CO2 capture, ab initio molecular dynamics, metadynamics\\n(H+). The released H+ may be abstracted by a free PZ forming\\na protonated PZ (PZH+) or a COO−moiety in a carbamate\\nforming a carbamic acid (PZCOOH). Our calculations predict\\nthe former, that is, 2 PZ + CO2 →PZCOO−+ PZH+ (ΔGaq =\\n−0.7 kcal/mol), to be slightly more thermodynamically\\nfavorable than the latter, that is, 2PZ + CO2 →PZCOOH +\\nPZ (ΔGaq = 2.2 kcal/mol). This can be understandable\\nconsidering that PZ is more basic than PZCOO−, thus\\nPZCOO−/PZH+ pair formation has been found to prevail over\\nPZCOOH formation.14\\nOnce formed, PZH+ may react with free PZ leading to\\nreactive AEAEPZH+ intermediate formation, that is, PZH+ +\\nFigure 1.

Subsequently, AEAEPZH+\\nmay undergo a reaction with PZ as described in the following\\nparagraph or release a proton to form AEAEPZ. We also\\nconsidered the possibility of urea formation from the reaction\\nbetween PZ and PZCOOH (PZ + PZCOOH →urea + H2O),\\nas reported in the cases of MEA and EDA.23,40 Our calculation\\npredicts the urea formation reaction to be endergonic (ΔGaq =\\n4.2 kcal/mol) while requiring overcoming a very high free-\\nenergy barrier of ΔA⧧= 42.2 kcal/mol. This implies the\\nunlikelihood of it occurring, which is consistent with previous\\nexperimental observations;17 hence, urea formation was ruled\\nout in the further analysis.\\nThe reaction of AEAEPZH+ with PZ may follow one of two\\nroutes that involve nucleophilic substitution, in which a\\nnucleophilic nitrogen (N) atom of PZ attacks either of the\\ntwo electrophilic carbon (C) atoms bonded to the protonated\\nN in AEAEPZH+,19 as illustrated in Figures 1 and 5:\\n(R1) Formation of AEP and AEPH+ (AEAEPZH+ + PZ →\\nAEP + AEPH+) is predicted to be an endergonic reaction\\n(ΔGaq = 0.8 kcal/mol); AEPH+ may subsequently release a\\nproton (ΔGaq = −0.5 kcal/mol), thus this reaction would yield\\ntwo stable AEP molecules per AEAEPZH+.\\n(R2) Formation of PEPH+ and EDA (AEAEPZH+ + PZ →\\nPEPH+ + EDA) is also predicted to be an endergonic reaction\\n(ΔGaq = 1.1 kcal/mol); PEPH+ may subsequently release a\\nproton (ΔGaq = −1.0 kcal/mol), thus this reaction would yield\\nstable PEP and EDA molecules per AEAEPZH+.\\nGiven the comparable ΔGaq, the two routes could be\\nconsidered nearly equally favorable from the perspective of\\nthermodynamics. However, according to experimental obser-\\nvations, AEP is the predominant product of thermal\\ndegradation of aqueous PZ loaded with CO2. This implies\\nthat kinetics may greatly contribute to determining the thermal\\ndegradation mechanisms, as demonstrated in our prior\\nwork.23−25,40 Molecular mechanisms underlying the reactions\\nof aqueous amine solvents for CO2 capture have been found to\\nbe often governed by the relative rates of competing reactions\\n(kinetics), instead of the comparative stabilities of products\\nand intermediates (thermodynamics). We evaluate the relative\\nrates of a few key reactions involved in PZ thermal degradation\\nby computing their free-energy barriers in the following\\nsections.\\nAEAEPZH+ Intermediate Formation. Metadynamics\\nsimulations were performed at two different temperatures,\\n313 and 413 K, to examine the temperature dependence of the\\nfree-energy barrier for AEAEPZH+ formation from the reaction\\nof PZ with PZH+. 30H2O, 1PZH+, 1PZ, and 1PZCOO−\\nmolecules were put in the periodic simulation box with a\\ncubic edge length of 12.1 Å, which corresponds to about 27 wt\\n% PZ solution at 0.33 CO2 loading. As illustrated in Figure 2,\\nthis reaction involves the ring opening of PZH+ by PZ; that is,\\nthe bond between the protonated N (denoted by N*) and\\nadjacent electrophilic C (C*) atoms in PZH+ is cleaved due to\\nnucleophilic attack by a lone pair on N of nearby PZ on the C*\\natom. The nucleophilic substitution reaction was described by\\na single collective variable (CV) of a linear combination of two\\nindependent bond distances, dN−C*−dN*−C*, (where dN−C* is\\nthe distance between the N of PZ and the C* of PZH+ and\\ndN*−C* is the distance of the N*−C* bond being broken in\\nPZH+).\\nFigure 2 shows the predicted free-energy barriers for the\\nPZH+ + PZ →AEAEPZH+ reaction at 313 and 413 K, along\\nwith the structural changes associated. In the initial state (IS),\\nPZ and PZH+ are separated with dN−C* = 4.15 Å and dN*−C* =\\n1.25 Å, yielding a CV value of 2.9 Å, at both 313 and 413 K. As\\nthe lone pair of N in PZ interacts with the C* atom in PZH+,\\nthe N*−C* bond is elongated. As such, dN−C* and dN*−C*\\nbecome 1.42 (1.61) Å and 1.92 (1.51) Å in the TS at 313 K\\n(413 K), respectively, yielding a CV value of −0.5 (0.1) Å. It is\\nalso worth noting the noticeable difference between the TS\\nconfigurations at 313 and 413 K, indicative of the strong\\ntemperature-dependence of an intermolecular reaction in\\naqueous amine solutions.24,25 The final state (FS) at both\\n313 and 413 K gives 1.52 Å of dN−C* and 3.43 Å of dN*−C*; the\\nresulting large negative CV value of −1.9 Å represents the\\nopen ring structure of AEAEPZH+.\\nThe free-energy barrier for the PZ + PZH+ →AEAEPZH+\\nreaction is predicted to be 20.9 kcal/mol at 313 K and\\ndecreases to 14.1 kcal/mol at 413 K; the respective return\\nbarriers are 10.1 and 10.4 kcal/mol. The lower barrier at 413 K\\nmay suggest that the thermal degradation of PZ via\\nAEAEPZH+ formation could be substantially facilitated at\\nhigh stripping temperatures as compared to that at low\\nabsorbing temperatures, consistent with existing experimental\\nobservations.19 The underlying mechanism responsible for the\\nstrong temperature dependence of AEAEPZH+ formation will\\nbe discussed in the following section.\\nLike the cases shown in our previous studies,24,25,40 the\\nintermolecular interaction leading to AEAEPZH+ formation\\ncan be largely determined by the solvation structure and\\ndynamics of PZ and PZH+. For a better understanding of the\\ntemperature effect, we analyzed their solvation behaviors at\\ndifferent temperatures. First, we computed the MSDs of water\\nmolecules surrounding PZ and PZH+. Here, MSD is given by |\\nRi(t) −Ri(0)|2, where Ri(t) and Ri(0) are the positions of atom\\ni at time t and 0, respectively. As shown in Figure 3a, the water\\nmolecules are evidently more mobile at 413 K than at 313 K,\\nenhancing the interaction between PZ and PZH+.\\nTo gain a deeper insight into the dynamic nature of the\\nsurrounding water molecules, we also evaluated their reorienta-\\ntional dynamics by computing the time correlation function.\\nThe water reorientation correlation function is defined as\\n=\\n[\\n·\\n]\\n[\\n·\\n]\\nu\\nu\\nu\\nu\\nC\\nt\\nP\\nt\\nP\\n( )\\n( )\\n(0)\\n(0)\\n(0)\\nu\\n(2)\\n2\\n2\\n(1)\\nFigure 2.

Eng. 2022, 10, 9584−9590\\n9586\\nwhere the angle bracket represents an ensemble and time\\naverage of the unit vector, P2 is the second-rank Legendre\\npolynomial, and u(t) and u(0) are the unit vectors along the\\ndipole moment of the water molecules (representing the\\nmolecular orientation at times t and 0, respectively). The water\\ndipole moment is computed with maximally localized Wannier\\nfunctions (MLWFs). Considering the MLWF centers are\\ntreated as quasiparticles, the locations and charges of the nuclei\\nand the centers of MLWFs are integrated to determine the\\ndipole moment. As illustrated in Figure 3b, the water\\nreorientation is found to occur much faster at 413 K than at\\n313 K, consistent with its higher mobility as predicted earlier.\\nWe also calculated the pair distribution function (PDF)\\nbetween N in PZ and C* in PZH+ (which are directly involved\\nin the formation of AEAEPZH+) using AIMD simulations. The\\nPDF is defined by g(r) = ⟨n(r, r + dr)/4πr2ρdr⟩, where ρ is the\\nbulk number density, and n(r, r + dr) denotes the number of\\nC* atom in a spherical shell of radius r with a thickness r from\\nthe reference N atom (or, vice versa). The g(r) was obtained\\nfrom the average of five independent runs with different\\nstarting configurations. As shown in Figure 4, two distinct\\npeaks appear around 6.0 and 7.6 Å at 413 K, implying that one\\nor two water molecules may exist between the N and C*\\natoms. On the other hand, the first peak appears around 7.7 Å\\nat 313 K, suggesting the presence of at least two water\\nmolecules hindering the interaction between N in PZ and C*\\nin PZH+.\\nOur analyses clearly demonstrate the strong temperature\\ndependence of solvation dynamics in the aqueous PZ/PZH+\\nsystem. The solvating water molecules become more mobile\\nand less rigidly organized with increasing temperature, thereby\\nenhancing the interaction between N in PZ and C* in PZH+.\\nThis could explain why the free-energy barrier for the PZ +\\nPZH+ →AEAEPZH+ reaction substantially drops as the\\ntemperature increases from 313 to 413 K.\\nKinetic Competitions for AEP versus PEP + EDA\\nFormations from AEAEPZH+. As described earlier, the\\npredominant formation of AEP over PEP + EDA from the\\nreaction of AEAEPZH+ with PZ could not be explained in\\nterms of thermodynamic favorability. Hence, we evaluated the\\nrelative rates of the two competing reactions by calculating\\ntheir free-energy barriers using metadynamics simulations at\\ntwo different temperatures (313 and 413 K). Here, the two\\nelectrophilic C atoms bonded to the protonated N (referred to\\nas N*) in AEAEPZH+ are denoted by C6 and C7, respectively;\\nrecall that AEP (PEP + EDA) formation involves the\\nnucleophilic attack of N of PZ on the C7 (C6) atom, as\\nshown in Figure 5. The nucleophilic substitution reaction was\\ndescribed with a single CV, dN−Ci−dN*−Ci; here, dN−Ci\\nrepresents the distance between the N in PZ and the Ci (i =\\n6 or 7) in AEAEPZH+, and dN*−Ci is the distance of the N*−Ci\\nbond in AEAEPZH+. CPMD-metadynamics simulations were\\ncarried out under periodic boundary conditions with a cubic\\nsimulation box of 12.15 Å side length, containing 1 PZ, 1\\nAEAEPZH+, and 40 water molecules.\\nAs shown in Figure 5, the IS indicates dN−Ci = 3.24 Å, and\\ndN*−Ci = 1.54 Å, yielding a CV of 1.7 Å (= dN−Ci−dN*−Ci); the\\nrelatively large positive value of CV indicates that PZ and\\nAEAEPZH+ are separated with no significant interaction. In\\nthe TS, dN−Ci decreases to 2.41 Å, while dN*−Ci increases to\\n2.63 Å, implying that the nucleophilic attack of PZ weakens\\nand elongates the N*−Ci bonds in AEAEPZH. In the FS, dN−Ci\\nfurther decreases to 1.51 Å, and dN*−Ci becomes 3.60 Å,\\nindicating N−Ci bond formation and N*−Ci bond scission.\\nThe predicted free-energy barrier for the nucleophilic\\nsubstitution reaction leading to AEP formation is 17.1 (7.9)\\nkcal/mol at 313 (413) K, and that leading to PEP + EDA\\nformation is 34.9 (23.2) kcal/mol. The substantial free-energy\\nbarrier difference clearly demonstrates that the AEP formation\\ncan be much more kinetically favorable than the PEP + EDA\\nformation. This result evidently supports the experimental\\nobservations that the major thermal degradation product by far\\nis AEP with EDA/PEP minor products in CO2-loaded aqueous\\nPZ.\\nIt is also worth noting that the free-energy barriers for both\\ncases significantly reduce with increasing temperature; the\\ntemperature dependence tends to be even stronger when\\ncompared with the case of AEAEPZH+ formation. Therefore,\\nthe rate-determining step for the PZ thermal degradation is\\nlikely to be temperature dependent; that is, the predicted free-\\nFigure 3.

Eng. 2022, 10, 9584−9590\\n9587\\nenergy barrier for AEAEPZH+ intermediate formation is\\nnoticeably higher than that for its subsequent reaction at 413\\nK, while the opposite is true at 313 K. This reiterates the\\nimportance of understanding temperature-dependent kinetics\\nand the reaction mechanism for the PZ thermal degradation,\\nwhile predicting the PZH+ + PZ →AEAEPZH+ reaction to be\\na rate-controlling step at high stripping temperatures.\\nTo evaluate the solvation effect on the intermolecular PZ +\\nAEAEPZH+ reaction, we assessed the interaction of water with\\nthe electrophilic C6 and C7 atoms in AEAEPZH+. The life-time\\nautocorrelation function, CX−W(t), for the binary interaction\\nbetween C6 or C7 (in AEAEPZH+) and OW (in nearby water)\\nmay indicate how long individual water molecules stay near the\\nC6 or C7 site. From the predicted correlation functions in\\nFigure 6, the average life-time (τC) of the C6−OW (C7−OW)\\ninteraction is estimated to be 10.1 (5.7) ps. The longer τC\\nimplies that water molecules may more strongly interact with\\nthe C6 atom; thus, the interaction between C6 and N (in PZ)\\ncould be more hindered than the C7−N interaction. We also\\ncompared the pairwise interactions between N in PZ and Ci (i\\n= 6, 7) in AEAEPZH+. As shown in Figure 7, the N−C6 and\\nN−C7 PDFs exhibit a distinct first peak around 5.0 and 7.0 Å,\\nrespectively, which may imply the presence of at least one\\nwater molecule (two water molecules) between the N and C6\\n(C7) atoms. These analyses evidently demonstrate that the C7\\nsite is more accessible to the N of PZ, which can be primarily\\nresponsible for the reduced free-energy barrier. As such, the\\nkinetic preference for the nucleophilic substitution reaction\\nleading to AEP formation provides an explanation for the\\npredominant production of AEP over PEP/EDA during\\nthermal degradation of CO2-loaded aqueous PZ.\\n■CONCLUSIONS\\nWe investigated the thermal degradation of aqueous PZ\\nsolution for CO2 capture, from both thermodynamics and\\nkinetics perspectives, using first-principles computational\\nmethods. Our key results are recapitulated as follows:\\n• The PZ thermal degradation is initiated by the reaction\\nof PZH+ with PZ leading to reactive AEAEPZH+\\nintermediate formation. The predicted free-energy\\nbarrier for this reaction substantially drops from 20.9\\nto 14.1 kcal/mol as the temperature increases from 313\\nto 413 K. Our analysis shows that the strong\\ntemperature dependence is primarily attributed to the\\nfact that the water molecules solvating the reactants\\nbecome more mobile and less rigidly organized with\\nincreasing temperature, thereby enhancing the inter-\\nmolecular reaction.\\n• The reaction of AEAEPZH+ with PZ may lead to the\\nformation of an AEP or PEP + EDA pair. While the two\\nFigure 5.

        "Abstract": "'Abstract: Chemical absorption of CO2 into aqueous amine solutions using a nonstirred bubble column was experimentally investigated. \\nThe performance of CO2 absorption of four different primary and secondary amines including monoethanolamine (MEA), piperazine \\n(PZ), 2-piperidineethanol (2PE), and homopiperazine (HPZ) were compared. The effects of initial concentration of amine, the inlet \\nmole fraction of CO2, and solution temperature on the rate of CO2 absorption and CO2 loading (mol CO2/mol amine) were studied in \\nthe range of 0.02–1 M, 0.10–0.15, and 25–40 °C, respectively. The effect of the presence of copper ions in the amine solution on CO2 \\nloading was also studied. By comparison of the breakthrough curves of the amines at different operational conditions, it was revealed \\nthat the shortest and longest time for the appearance of the breakthrough point was observed for MEA and HPZ solutions, respectively. \\nCO2 loading of MEA, 2PE, PZ, and HPZ aqueous solutions at 25 °C, 0.2 M of initial concentration of amine, and 0.15 of inlet mole \\nfraction of CO2 were 1.06, 1.14, 1.13, and 1.18 mol CO2/mol amine, respectively. By decreasing the inlet mole fraction of CO2 from 0.15 \\nto 0.10, CO2 loading slightly decreased. As the initial concentration of amine and temperature decreased, CO2 loading increased. Also, \\nthe presence of copper ions in the absorbent solution resulted in a decrease in the CO2 loading of MEA and HPZ aqueous solutions. In \\ncase of PZ and 2PE amines, adding copper ions led to precipitation even at low copper ion concentrations.\\nKey words: CO2 absorption, carbon capture and storage, amine, copper, monoethanolamine, piperazine, homopiperazine, \\n2-piperidineethanol \\nReceived: 31.08.2021              Accepted/Published Online: 23.02.2022              Final Version: 05.08.2022\\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\\nhttp://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/chem/\\nTurkish Journal of Chemistry\\nTurk J Chem\\n(2022) 46: 999-1010\\n© TÜBİTAK\\ndoi:10.55730/1300-0527.3410\\nResearch Article\\nYOUSEFZADEH et al. / Turk J Chem\\n1000\\nsystems in literature [15–21]. Especially, MEA aqueous solution is used as the absorbent in the industrial-scale CO2 \\nremoving systems [5, 22]. \\nHuge energy consumption for solvent regeneration is the main drawback of amine-based CO2 capture systems. \\nElectrochemical CO2 capture technology, which is a relatively new method under development, stands out by directly \\neliminating the high energy consumption in the MEA process since it is a process carried out at a low temperature [23]. \\nIn addition, electrochemical CO2 capture technology reduces electrical losses and prevents side reactions by precise \\ncontrol of potential. There are two main approaches to CO2 capture by electrochemical methods in the literature: (i) using \\nelectrochemical processes for both CO2 capture and CO2 release (overall approach), (ii) conventional methods for CO2 \\ncapture (e.g., MEA process) and CO2 release using the electrochemical method (hybrid approach) [24]. In the hybrid \\napproach, formed CO2-amine complex is pumped to the anode of an electrochemical cell where metal ions (e.g., Cu(II)) \\nare dissolved by the potential applied to the anode. These metal ions form a complex with the amine, allowing the amine-\\nCO2 complex to release CO2. The resulting Cu(II)-amine complexes are pumped to the cathode in the electrochemical \\ncell and the amine is liberated and recovered by reduction of the metal ion (reduced Cu(II) accumulates on the cathode \\nas Cu(s)). Regenerated amine is then sent back to the absorption column. During the electrochemical regeneration, some \\ncopper-amine complexes stay in the aqueous phase [25] resulting in a decrease in CO2 loading compared to the copper \\nions free amine solution due to occupying some portion of free amines by the formation of the metal-amine complexes \\n[26]. Nevertheless, the presence of copper ions and the interaction between copper ions and amines enable the modulation \\nof CO2 loading in electrochemical CO2 capture systems.\\nIn this study, the rate of CO2 absorption and CO2 loading of four primary and secondary amines including \\nmonoethanolamine (MEA), piperazine (PZ), 2-piperdineethanol (2PE), and homopiperazine (HPZ) in a lab-scale bubble \\ncolumn were investigated. Effect of process parameters including temperature, CO2 initial mole fraction, and amine \\nconcentration were studied by varying between 25–40 °C, 0.10–0.15, and 0.02–1 M, respectively. Also, the effect of the \\npresence of copper ions in the amine solution on the CO2 loading was also studied by varying the concentration of copper \\nions between 0.02–0.2 M and compared to absorption without any copper ions. This was carried out for amines such as \\nPZ, HPZ, and 2PE for the first time in the literature. \\n2. Materials and methods\\n2.1. Materials\\nMonoethanolamine (hereafter referred to as MEA) was obtained from the TÜPRAŞ R&D center. Piperazine (PZ), \\nhomopiperazine (HPZ), 2-piperidineethanol (2PE), and copper (II) nitrate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. CO2 \\nand N2 gases (99.999%) were obtained from Air Liquide. Ultra-pure water (MilliQ, 18.2 MΩ) was used to prepare amine \\nsolutions at the desired amine concentration as the absorbent. \\n2.2. Absorption setup\\nThe schematic of the experimental setup of the CO2 absorption system used in this study is shown in Figure 1. A graduated \\ncylinder with an internal diameter of 3.2 cm and a total volume of 280 mL was used as the bubble column. The top of this \\ncylinder was plugged using a stopper with three holes to insert the tubing for inlet flue gas, the outlet gas, and a thermometer. \\nTeflon tubes were used for all the gas lines. Prior to sending the simulated flue gas into the bubble column, an aqueous solution \\ncontaining a certain amount of amine and MilliQ water was prepared and placed in the bubble column. The temperature \\nof the column and amine solution was tuned to the desired temperature using a water jacket connected to a heating water \\ncirculator (Cole Parmer, Model 12108-15). Also, the gas mixture line was preheated by a water jacket up to the amine solution \\ntemperature. The temperature of the solution during the absorption experiments was recorded using a thermometer. The \\nflue gas mixture was simulated by combining CO2 and N2 gas delivered by calibrated mass flow controllers (MFC, Teledyne \\nHastings HFC202). The mole fraction of CO2 in the gas mixture was adjusted by adjusting the volumetric flowrates of CO2 and \\nN2 at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure. The flow rate of the gas mixture was kept constant at 250 mL/min. In the first stage, the \\nentire inlet line was cleaned using a bypass line with pure nitrogen. Then, N2 gas was passed through the bubble column and \\nthe outlet line between the column and the CO2 sensor (GasLab, SprintIR®-W 100% CO2 sensor) was cleaned in the same way \\nuntil the sensor showed zero mole fraction of CO2. Then, CO2 was added to the gas stream at a certain CO2 mole fraction and \\nthis time was recorded as the start time of CO2 absorption. The inlet gas line was sent through the stopper hole to the bottom \\nof the bubble column and bubbled through an air stone before mixing it into the amine solution. CO2 in a gas mixture with \\na high concentration is captured by the amine solution in the column, and a gas mixture with zero or low CO2 concentration \\nis obtained in the outlet. The amine and water vapor were removed from the outlet gas mixture using a condenser at 5 °C \\nto prevent damaging the CO2 sensor by the amine and water vapor. Since the amount of amine vapor in the gas mixture \\nleaving the condenser was negligible due to a very high Henry’s constant and vapor pressure of water was low at 5 °C, it was \\nYOUSEFZADEH et al. / Turk J Chem\\n1001\\nassumed that the outlet gas mixture consisted of only N2 and CO2. The mole fraction of CO2 in the outlet gas mixture was \\nmeasured using the online CO2 sensor until the mole fraction reached the inlet mole fraction of CO2 (equilibrium condition). \\nIn every absorption experiment, the output CO2 concentration was plotted against time. This curve is called the breakthrough \\ncurve. Typically, in a breakthrough curve, a zero-outlet concentration of the compound of interest is observed up to a certain \\ntime after which the outlet concentration starts to increase. The time at which the outlet concentration reaches 5% of inlet \\nconcentration is called the breakthrough time. Also, saturation time is the time at which the inlet and outlet concentrations \\nbecome identical. After this time, the system is in a liquid-gas thermodynamic equilibrium state. \\n2.3. Measurement of the rate of CO2 absorption\\nMass balance for CO2 in the gas phase was performed to determine the rate of CO2 absorption from the gas phase into the \\nliquid phase, as shown by

Results and discussion\\n3.1. Breakthrough curves and CO2 loading\\nAccording to the breakthrough curves given in Figure 2, the mole fraction of CO2 was zero at the outlet for a while, \\nindicating that all the CO2 of the inlet stream was absorbed by the solution. After the breakthrough point was reached in \\neach curve, the mole fraction of CO2 at the outlet stream started to increase more rapidly and finally reached the saturation \\npoint where the inlet and outlet mole fractions of CO2 were equal. The breakthrough curves for CO2 absorption of different \\namines at 25 °C shown in Figure 2a were obtained when the initial mole fraction of CO2 and initial concentration of amine \\nwere 0.15 and 0.2 M, respectively. The breakthrough time was approximately 1000, 1230, 1520, and 1700 s for MEA, 2PE, \\nPZ, and HPZ, respectively. The breakthrough was observed after 2850, 3000, 3250, and 4300 s for 2PE, HPZ, PZ, and MEA, \\nrespectively. MEA was the amine with the fastest breakthrough but the latest to the saturation point. The effect of the initial \\nconcentration of amines on the rate of CO2 absorption and loading was investigated by lowering the initial concentration \\nof amines from 0.2 M to 0.1 M while keeping other parameters unchanged. The breakthrough time and equilibrium state \\nwere obtained earlier at a low initial concentration of amines, as shown in Figure 2b. The breakthrough occurred at 500, \\nFigure 2. Breakthrough curves of CO2 absorption by amine solutions: initial concentration of \\namine, inlet mole fraction of CO2, and temperature were a) 0.2 M, 0.15, 25 °C; b) 0.1 M, 0.15, \\n25 °C; c) 0.2 M, 0.10, 25 °C; d) 0.2 M, 0.15, 40 °C, respectively.\\nYOUSEFZADEH et al. / Turk J Chem\\n1003\\n620, 790, and 825 s for MEA, 2PE, PZ, and HPZ, respectively, and equilibrium was observed after 1650, 1830, 2050, and \\n2340 s for 2PE, PZ, HPZ, and MEA, respectively. When the amine concentration was reduced to half, the breakthrough \\ntime was approximately two times faster. The breakthrough curves in Figure 2c were obtained by reducing the initial \\nmole fraction of CO2 to 0.10 at 0.2 M amine concentration. When the gas mixture with a lower mole fraction of CO2 was \\ndelivered to the column, the breakthrough time increased (1150, 1695, 1915, and 2670 s for MEA, 2PE, PZ, and HPZ, \\nrespectively) compared to the case of 0.15 of CO2 mole fraction. The effect of temperature was investigated by increasing \\nthe temperature of the heating jacket from 25 to 40 °C while keeping the other parameters constant. The breakthrough \\ntimes were obtained at 795, 1260, 1350, and 1685 s for MEA, PZ, 2PE, and HPZ, respectively. The breakthrough at 25 °C \\nfor MEA showed different behavior in comparison with the other amines. As shown in Figure 2a, the mole fraction of CO2 \\nin the breakthrough curve of MEA solution at 25 °C increased rapidly starting from the breakthrough time up to a certain \\ntime followed by a slow increase in the mole fraction until the equilibrium condition was reached. For the experiments \\ndone with MEA at 40 °C, the equilibrium condition was obtained at a longer time range and the breakthrough time \\nappeared earlier compared to other amines. Generally, the breakthrough time was obtained in shorter time ranges for \\nMEA than other amines. In all experiments performed at 25 °C, the breakthrough time increased in the order of MEA, \\n2PE, PZ, and HPZ (MEA the fastest, HPZ the slowest). In the experiments carried out at 40 °C, the breakthrough time of \\nPZ was ahead of 2PE, and the breakthrough times increased in the order of MEA, PZ, 2PE, and HPZ.\\nThe rate of CO2 absorption for all experiments was calculated using equation (5) and plotted against the time, as shown \\nin Figure 3. In all the curves shown, the rate of CO2 absorption was constant for a certain period of time since the mole \\nfraction of CO2 at the outlet was zero during that period. After that period, the rate of CO2 absorption was observed to \\ndecrease. Zwitterion mechanism which was first proposed by Caplow [27] and reintroduced by Danckwert [28] was widely \\nused to interpret the kinetic data of CO2 absorption into aqueous amine solutions. This mechanism consists of two main \\nreactive steps. First, the nucleophilic nitrogen atom in the amine provides its electron pair to form a chemical bond with \\nthe electrophilic carbon atom of CO2. As a result, an unstable compound called zwitterion is produced. Then, the formed \\nzwitterion reacts with any base compound in the solution such as OH– and amine molecules (also H2O) to form carbamate. \\nUsing this mechanism, the rate of the CO2 absorption reactions is derived as a function of concentrations of amine, \\nFigure 3. The rate of CO2 absorption into amine solutions: initial concentration of amine, \\ninlet mole fraction of CO2, and temperature were a) 0.2 M, 0.15, 25 °C; b) 0.1 M, 0.15, 25 °C; \\nc) 0.2 M, 0.10, 25 °C; d) 0.2 M, 0.15, 40 °C, respectively.\\nYOUSEFZADEH et al. / Turk J Chem\\n1004\\nOH–, H2O, and CO2. According to the zwitterion mechanism, the rate of CO2 absorption is proportional to the amine \\nconcentration [27–29]. As the amine becomes depleted due to the reaction with CO2, the rate of CO2 absorption decreases \\nand finally reaches the thermodynamic equilibrium state at which the rate of CO2 absorption becomes zero.\\nThe cumulative amount of absorbed CO2 was obtained by integration of absorption rate data versus time. Subsequently, \\nthe cumulative amount of absorbed CO2 was divided by the initial number of moles of amine in the system to obtain the \\nCO2 loading of different amines. CO2 loading of HPZ, 2PE, PZ, and MEA at different process conditions is presented in \\nFigure 4. According to this figure, in the absorption runs with inlet CO2 mole fraction of 0.15, HPZ showed the highest CO2 \\nloading with 1.32 and 1.18 mol CO2/mol amine at 25 °C in both cases of 0.1 and 0.2 M of initial concentration of amines, \\nrespectively. CO2 loading in any CO2-H2O-amine system depends on the concentration of amine, temperature, and partial \\npressure of CO2. Even at a constant temperature at which the equilibrium constants of reactions are fixed, the equilibrium \\nconcentrations may change by changing the initial amounts of amine and CO2 partial pressure in the system [18, 30]. Here, \\nas the initial concentration of amine decreased, the CO2 loading increased since a change in the initial concentration of \\nthe amine leads to the changes in the equilibrium concentrations of compounds in the vapor-liquid equilibrium system \\nof CO2-H2O-amine [18,19]. The effect of inlet mole fraction of CO2 and absorption temperature were also investigated. \\nWhen the inlet mole fraction of CO2 was reduced from 0.15 to 0.10, the CO2 loading remained approximately constant for \\nHPZ, PZ, and 2PE, but decreased for MEA. Increasing the temperature from 25 to 40 °C at constant amine concentration \\n(0.2 M) and inlet mole fraction of CO2 (0.15) resulted in a decrease in CO2 loading of MEA, 2PE, PZ, and HPZ aqueous \\nsolutions from 1.06 to 0.95, 1.14 to 1.08, 1.13 to 1.12, and 1.18 to 1.15, respectively. In conclusion, as the inlet mole \\nfraction of CO2 increased and the initial concentration of amine and temperature decreased, the CO2 loading increased. \\nThe obtained results were compared to the literature. Jou et al. [31] reported that the solubility of CO2 in an MEA/H2O \\nsolution decreases by increasing the temperature and decreasing the CO2 partial pressure. They reported a solubility of \\nabout 0.6 mol CO2/mol amine at 25 °C, CO2 partial pressure of 11.8 kPa, and 30 mass percent of MEA (5 mol/L). However, \\nthe concentrations used in our study (0.1 and 0.2 mol/L) were much lower than 5 mol/L resulting in a higher CO2 loading \\nwhich was in line with a trend that can be seen from the screening work conducted by Aronu et al. [30]. A similar result \\ncan be seen from another study, performed by Kim et al., which compared the CO2 absorption characteristics of aqueous \\nsolutions of diamines. They reported a CO2 loading of 0.775 and 0.839 mol CO2/mol amine for 30 mass percent of PZ and \\nHPZ solutions (5 mol/L) at 40 °C and CO2 mole fraction of 0.3 in the inlet simulated gas stream. Here, they showed that \\nincreasing the temperature led to a decrease in the CO2 loading. The CO2 loading for lower amine concentrations was not \\nreported [32]. Derks et al. reported that the CO2 loading into the aqueous solution of piperazine decreased with an increase \\nin temperature and amine concentration. For example, they observed that the CO2 loading decreased from 1.02 to 0.98 \\nmol CO2/mol amine when the temperature increased from 25 to 40 °C for an aqueous solution with amin concentration \\nof 0.2 mol/L and CO2 partial pressure of approximately 10 kPa [33].    \\nMEA and HPZ, the amines with the lowest and highest CO2 loading as shown in Figure 4, were chosen to be studied \\nin a wide range of initial concentrations of amine ranging from 0.02 up to 1 M. To that end, the temperature of amine \\nFigure 4. CO2 loading of HPZ, 2PE, PZ, and MEA amines (inlet \\nmixed gas flow rate has been kept constant at 250 mL/min for all \\nexperiments).\\nYOUSEFZADEH et al. / Turk J Chem\\n1005\\nsolutions, the total volumetric flow rate of the inlet gas mixture and the inlet mole fraction of CO2 were kept constant \\nin all experiments at 25 °C, 250 mL/min and 0.15, respectively. According to the breakthrough curves shown in Figure \\n5, breakthrough times with respect to the initial amine concentrations of 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, and 1 M, were found to be 105, \\n500, 1000, and 4500 s for MEA and 240, 825, 1700, and 9980 s for HPZ, respectively. At all concentrations analyzed, \\nbreakthrough with MEA was faster than HPZ. Also, as the amine concentration increased, the differences between the \\nbreakthrough times for MEA and HPZ increased.\\nCO2 loading was calculated according to Equation 5 and the results are presented in Figure 6. As the initial concentration \\nof MEA increased from 0.02 to 1 M, the CO2 loading decreased from 2.25 to 0.72 mol CO2/mol amine. The results were \\nsimilar to the literature. Aronu et al. reported that at an MEA concentration of 1 mol/L, the CO2 loading was obtained as \\n0.66 mol CO2/mol amine which was very close to the value obtained in our study (0.72 mol CO2/mol amine). Also, they \\nshowed that by further increasing MEA concentration from 1 to 5 mol/L, the CO2 loading decreased from 0.66 to 0.53 mol \\nCO2/mole MEA. The curve of CO2 loading versus the amine concentration showed that using the amine concentrations \\nlower than 1 mol/L led to a further increase of the CO2 loading, in line with results reported in our study. In addition, \\nthey showed that decreasing the CO2 partial pressure from 15 to 9.5 kPa led to a decrease in the CO2 loading for different \\nFigure 5.

In experiments with HPZ, as the amine concentration increased from 0.02 M to 0.2 M, the CO2 \\nloading decreased from 3.45 to 1.15 mol CO2/mol amine and remained almost constant by a further increase in the initial \\nconcentration of HPZ from 0.2 to 1 M. \\n3.2. pH of the solution\\nAccording to the zwitterion mechanism [34, 35], the rate of CO2 absorption is affected by the concentration of the hydroxyl \\nion as well as the amine and CO2 concentration. In this mechanism, as the concentration of the hydroxyl ion decreases, \\nthe rate of CO2 absorption also decreases. For this purpose, the pH values \\u200bof the amine solutions at the beginning and \\nthe CO2 saturation point were measured in the experiments performed at 25 °C, 0.2 M of initial amine concentration, \\nand 0.15 of inlet CO2 mole fraction. The results are presented in Figure 7. Amine solutions were initially basic with pH \\nvalues \\u200babove 11. Table 1 shows the reactions which are expected to take place in the CO2-amine-water system during the \\nabsorption/desorption [31, 34, 36, 37]. pH values above 11 of amine solutions before feeding CO2 was due to protonation \\nof amine shown by reaction R4 in Table 1, consuming hydronium ions. The pH values \\u200b\\u200bdecreased after the solutions were \\nfed with CO2. According to reactions in Table 1, as the solution was fed with CO2, the reaction R2 goes in the forward \\ndirection producing bicarbonate ions and hydronium ions. The produced bicarbonate ions are consumed by amine in \\nthe forward reaction R5. This decreases the bicarbonate ion concentration forcing reaction R2 to proceed in the forward \\ndirection producing more bicarbonate ions as well as hydronium ions. A portion of hydronium ions is also produced \\nby forward reaction of R3. As a result, the increase in hydronium ion concentration, as well as a decrease in hydroxyl \\nFigure 7. pH values of amine solutions at the beginning \\nand at the end of CO2 absorption (initial amine \\nconcentration 0.2 M, input CO2 concentration 0.15, gas \\nmixture flow rate 250 mL/min, temperature 25 °C).\\nTable 1.

Initial and posttreatment pH values \\u200b\\u200bdecreased from 11.86 to 7.98, \\n11.57 to 7.51, 11.17 to 7.76, and from 11.35 to 7.72 for 2PE, HPZ, MEA, and PZ, respectively. Since the solution came to \\nthermodynamic equilibrium after the treatment, the solution was not completely neutralized since the unreacted amines \\nstay in the solution even if their concentration was small.\\n3.3. Effect of copper ions\\nIn electrochemical amine regeneration systems, the amine-CO2 complex is pumped to the anode of an electrochemical cell \\nwhere the metal ions (e.g., Cu(II)) are dissolved by the potential applied to the anode. These metal ions compete with CO2 \\nto form a complex with the amine, allowing the release of CO2. The obtained metal(II)-amine complexes are pumped to \\nthe cathode in the electrochemical cell to reduce the metal ion and regenerate the amine (reduced metal ions accumulate \\nin the solid metal form on the cathode). Copper is the most preferred metal to be used in these electrochemical cells [24]. \\nThe presence of copper ions in the regenerated amine solution affects the CO2 loading of the solution. For this reason, \\nthe CO2 loading of amine solutions with different copper ion concentrations was measured. Copper(II) nitrate was added \\nto the solutions to prepare the certain concentrations of copper ions in the solutions. Precipitation was observed for 2PE \\nand PZ amines as copper ions were introduced into the solution. For this reason, only aqueous solutions containing MEA \\nand HPZ were subjected to CO2 absorption in the presence of copper ions. MEA and HPZ solutions with copper ions in a \\nconcentration range of 0.02–0.1 M were prepared. The initial concentration of amine, the inlet mole fraction of CO2, inlet \\ngas mixture volumetric flow rate, and temperature of the solution were kept constant at 0.2 M, 0.15, 250 mL/min, and 40 \\n°C, respectively. According to Figures 8a and b, as the copper concentration increased in MEA and HPZ solutions, the \\nbreakthrough time decreased.\\nFigure 9 shows the CO2 loading of each case calculated by integration of the absorption rate of CO2 versus time, as \\nexplained in section 2.3. It was found that as the concentration of copper (II) ions increased, CO2 loading for both HPZ \\nand MEA decreased significantly from 1.15 (0 M copper) to 0.33 mol CO2/mol HPZ (0.1 M copper), and from 0.95 (0 M \\ncopper) to 0.59 mol CO2/mol MEA (0.05 M copper), respectively. Reactions R7, R8, R9, and R10 shown in Table 2 indicate \\nthat copper ions react with one, two, three, or four amines, respectively, and form different types of copper (II)-amine \\ncomplexes [26]. Only a very small fraction of the copper(II)-amine complexes can form free amines as a result of the \\nreverse reaction. Thus, the concentration of free amines in this system is smaller compared to that of copper-free amine \\nsolutions since most of the copper(II)-amine complexes are not regenerated as free amine due to higher equilibrium \\nconstants of copper (II)-amine complex formation reactions [26, 38]. As a result, CO2 loading in systems containing copper \\n(II) ions decreases. According to Figure 9, the decreases in CO2 loading due to the presence of copper ions were observed \\nfor both MEA and HPZ. Especially the large change in CO2 loading in case of HPZ is promising for electrochemical amine \\nregeneration.\\n4. Conclusion\\nThe process of CO2 capture by amine-based chemical absorption routes has high CO2 removal efficiency and is easy to \\nscale up. The physical and chemical properties of amine-H2O-CO2 systems affect the CO2 removal efficiency. Among them, \\nviscosity, density, solubility of CO2, type of amine, rate of reaction,\\xa0rate of mass transfer, and heat of regeneration are the \\nFigure 8. Copper ion effect (0.2 M of initial concentration of amine, 0.15 of inlet mole fraction of \\nCO2, 40 °C of temperature) (No data for 0.2 M MEA solution at 0.1 M Cu(II) concentration was \\nobtained since precipitation was observed).\\nYOUSEFZADEH et al. / Turk J Chem\\n1008\\nimportant factors affecting the CO2 removal efficiency. In this study, the effect of type of amine on CO2 loading at different \\namine concentrations, inlet mole fractions of CO2, and temperatures was investigated. Aqueous solutions of four different \\namines including MEA, 2PE, PZ, and HPZ were used as the absorbent for chemical absorption of CO2 using a nonstirred \\nbubble column. CO2 loading of MEA, 2PE, PZ, and HPZ aqueous solutions at 25 °C, 0.2 M of initial concentration of \\namine, and 0.15 of inlet mole fraction of CO2 was 1.06, 1.14, 1.13, and 1.18 mol CO2/mol amine, respectively. Thus, the \\nhighest CO2 loading was observed for HPZ among the studied amines. By decreasing the inlet mole fraction of CO2 \\nfrom 0.15 to 0.10, the CO2 loading slightly decreased. As the initial concentration of amine decreased to 0.1 M, the CO2 \\nloading increased to 1.19, 1.30, 1.25, 1.32 mol CO2/mol amine for MEA, 2PE, PZ, and HPZ, respectively. Also, increasing \\nthe temperature up to 40 °C decreased the CO2 loading to 0.95, 1.08, 1.12, 1.15 mol CO2/mol amine for MEA, 2PE, PZ, \\nand HPZ, respectively. The CO2 removal efficiency of the interested amine solutions in presence of copper ions was also \\ninvestigated. The results demonstrated that the addition of copper ions to the fresh amine solution leads to a decrease \\nin the CO2 loading of MEA and HPZ aqueous solutions. Increasing the concentration of copper ions from 0 to 0.05 M \\nresulted in a decrease in CO2 loading at 40 °C, from 1.15 to 0.75 and 0.95 to 0.59 mol CO2/mol amine for HPZ and MEA, \\nrespectively. Further increase in the concentration of copper ions to 0.1 M led to precipitation in MEA solution and a \\nfurther decrease in CO2 loading to 0.34 mol CO2/mol amine for HPZ solution. However, in the case of PZ and 2PE amines, \\nadding copper ions led to precipitation even at low copper ion concentrations. \\nAcknowledgment \\nFinancial support of Turkish Scientific and Technological Research Council (TÜBİTAK) under project no. 218M850 is \\nacknowledged.\\nFigure 9.

Built on a proven rate-based packed bed absorber model,\\nthe RPB model rigorously simulates the phase and chemical equilibria\\nat the vapor−liquid interface, the heat and mass transfer across the gas\\nand liquid films, the fast reactions between MEA and CO2 in the liquid\\nfilm, and the RPB hydraulics. Estimation of the rate of transfer of mass\\nacross the liquid film is central to accurate simulation of the CO2\\nabsorption process with MEA aqueous solutions. We show that the\\nliterature lab-scale RPB data for CO2 removal efficiency can be\\nsatisfactorily correlated by introducing a correction factor for the\\neffective packing surface area predicted by the Onda correlation. Given the validated RPB model, we further show that, among the\\ngas-phase mass transfer coefficient, the liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient, and the reaction rate constant for the reaction between\\namine and CO2, the reaction rate constant is the controlling step with the greatest potential to enhance the CO2 absorption\\nperformance in RPB.'"

Herein, a kind of fibrous\\nmesoporous silica microspheres and its derivatives tailored by amine (APS-F-SiO2), carboxyl (COOH-F-SiO2),\\nphosphate (DPTS-F-SiO2) and amidoxime (AD-F-SiO2), respectively, were successfully fabricated for high effi-\\ncient U(VI) capture from aqueous solution. The synthesized sorbents were well characterized by SEM, FT-IR, N2\\nsorption-desorption measurement and TGA, which confirms achievement of the functionalization. The U(VI)\\nsorption onto these microsphere sorbents was then explored in detail. The results clearly show that these mi-\\ncrosphere materials especially APS-F-SiO2and COOH-F-SiO2 are indeed effective U(VI) sorbents, in terms of\\nconsiderable sorption capacity of ~200 mg/g, the short equilibrium time of less than 30 min, the ionic strength-\\nindependent nature, and desirable selectivity towards U(VI) over a range of competing ions. Moreover, the\\nsorbed U(VI) ions can be easily desorbed from the sorbents by controlling a lower pH, e.g. pH 1.0, and the\\nreclaimed sorbent can be reused without obvious reduction of U(VI) uptake even after 4 sorption-desorption\\ncycles, implying an excellent stability and reusability of the sorbents. These sorbents also keep high performance\\nin U(VI) sorption even following 400 kGy gamma irradiation in water, which further highlights the opportunity\\nfor this kind of materials in radionuclide separation.

It was in the agreement with the expected number of \\n229 \\ncombinations of possible CO2 absorption mechanisms of ILs and amines.  \\n230 \\nIn the case of amines that reacts according to Scheme 2a, 2b (MEA, DEA) the \\n231 \\nmaximum absorption was possible in 100% amine solution and decreased with the dilution \\n232 \\nwith either amine or water. In the case of TMG the water presence was also crucial for CO2 \\n233 \\nabsorption. In pure TMG no absorption of CO2 was observed. \\n234 \\nIn the case of amines which do not form carbamates (TEA, DBU, DABCO) but \\n235 \\nfollow Scheme 2c mechanism the maximum CO2 absorption was observed in the binary \\n236 \\nmixture containing only amine and water. The composition of the optimal mixture (in terms \\n237 \\nof maximal capacity) in those cases could be determined by the position of the equilibrium in \\n238 \\nthe CO2 saturated solution of aqueous amine (Scheme 2c). In the case of highly basic amines \\n239 \\nthe optimal molar ratio of amine:water was close to 1 and gradually increased with the \\n240 \\ndecrease of amine basicity (Fig. 1, amine-water side).  \\n241 \\nThe effect of ILs structure and concentration on CO2 absorption was minor but two \\n242 \\npatterns could be identified. In the case of [emim][OcSO4], a gradual decrease of the amount \\n243 \\nof CO2 absorbed in a binary aqueous amine solution or in pure amine with the addition of IL \\n244 \\nwas observed. Due to the relatively large capacity of pure [bmim][OAc] the dilution effect \\n245 \\nwas smaller. Also, mixtures close to IL vertex or binary amine-[bmim][OAc] mixtures had \\n246 \\nsubstantial absorption capacities as well.  \\n247 \\nAnother identified feature of [bmim][OAc] mixtures was strong negative impact of \\n248 \\nwater on the absorption capacity of binary IL-water mixtures. The reason for this is an unique \\n249 \\nabsorption mechanism valid for imidazolium ILs with basic anion (Shi et al., 2012). However, \\n250 \\n11 \\n \\nthe CO2 absorption in [emim][OcSO4] was not affected by water presence and in most cases \\n251 \\n[emim][OcSO4] and water can be replaced with each other without the effect on the \\n252 \\nabsorption capacity. In such cases it was determined by the amine content in a ternary system. \\n253 \\nClear synergistic effect was apparent (Fig. 1B, 1G) when a highly basic amine such \\n254 \\nas DBU was used with both investigated ILs. The reason is the possibility of DBU may act as \\n255 \\na proton acceptor and promote the carboxylation of imidazolium ring. The mechanism of \\n256 \\nchemisorption in DBU systems was confirmed by means of 13C NMR studies (Fig. 2 A, B, \\n257 \\nTable 3). A formation of a signal at 120.5 ppm which corresponds to the newly formed \\n258 \\ncarboxylic group attached to C2 carbon of imidazolium ring was identical to the observed \\n259 \\nsignal in [bmim][OAc] systems. In the presence of water the signal gradually decreased and in \\n260 \\nDBU-[emim][OcSO4]-H2O mixture CO2 reacted only towards bicarbonate. \\n261 \\n \\nInterestingly, TMG did not showed the ability to promote carboxylation of \\n262 \\nimidazolium ring by CO2 in [emim][OcSO4] mixtures despite only 0.5-1 units lower basicity \\n263 \\nthan DBU (Kaupmees et al., 2014). This was confirmed by 13C NMR studies where no 121 \\n264 \\nppm signal was detected in TMG-[emim][OcSO4] solutions but only 159 ppm derived from \\n265 \\ncarbamate anion (Table 3). This probably results from preferred formation of the carbamate \\n266 \\ninstead of proton abstraction from imidazolium ring by TMG. Such behavior indicates that \\n267 \\nonly highly basic tertiary amines can promote carboxylate formation in imidazolium ILs with \\n268 \\nneutral anions. In the case of TMG we were not able to detect HCO3- anion which confirms \\n269 \\nthe preferred fixation of CO2 to carbamate by this amine. \\n270 \\nIn the case of [emim][OcSO4] which is chemically inert towards CO2 the model \\n271 \\nderived from Eq. (1) was relatively simple with 3-7 coefficients (Table 1) depending on the \\n272 \\nnature of the amine. In all cases coefficients a1 and a2 corresponding to absorption of CO2 in \\n273 \\npure water or IL were very low and statistically insignificant. Coefficients a3 were high in the \\n274 \\ncase of reactive amine (TMG, DEA) and were equal to the amount of CO2 absorbed by 1 g of \\n275 \\nan amine. In the case of TMG (MW 115.18) the theoretical value was 8.7 mmol CO2∙g-1, and \\n276 \\nin the case of DEA (MW 105.14) 4.75 mmol CO2∙g-1 which indicates 90% and 50% yield of \\n277 \\nabsorption in pure amines, respectively. For comparison the coefficients a2 for MEA was 8-\\n278 \\n8.35 (Baj et al., 2013) indicating nearly quantitative yield. In the case of DEA this is due to \\n279 \\nthe formation of solid products which limited the contact with CO2 and prevented quantitative \\n280 \\nyields. The effect was negligible for MEA. Dilution DEA with an IL or water prevented the \\n281 \\n12 \\n \\nsolidification of reaction mixture and increased the amount of CO2 absorbed (Fig 1D). It is \\n282 \\nespecially visible in solutions of DEA (Fig. 1E). Coefficients b13 were significant in all \\n283 \\ninvestigated cases. High values were observed only for tertiary amines where it describes the \\n284 \\nposition of optimal composition of a binary mixture. In the case of DEA it was probably \\n285 \\ndetermined by solubility of amine or carbamate salt which affected the yield of reaction with \\n286 \\nCO2. Coefficient d was significant for DABCO, TEA and DBU. High positive values suggest \\n287 \\ncomplex interactions between three components. The most likely is the possibility of shifting \\n288 \\nthe reaction equilibrium given in Scheme 2c depending on the relative concentration of water \\n289 \\nand IL. \\n290 \\nThe models for [bmim][OAc] presented in Table 2 are more complex. In all cases \\n291 \\ncoefficient a1 was insignificant whereas a3 was high for TMG, DEA. Coefficients b13 were \\n292 \\nhigh for all amines in both ILs indicating either chemical equilibrium or improvement of yield \\n293 \\ndue to dissolution of solid products. This is especially visible for DEA where absorption in \\n294 \\npure amine was difficult but the dilution with water or IL leaded to better solubility of CO2. \\n295 \\nIn contrast with [emim][OcSO4] a2 value for [bmim][OAc] was high and b13 was \\n296 \\nnegative. This reflects the detrimental effect of water on the chemisorption capacity of \\n297 \\n[bmim][OAc]. The value of a2 for [bmim][OAc] in the range of 1.53-1.88 was roughly 2/3 of \\n298 \\nthe theoretical value. For the IL of MW 198.3 the theoretical value equals ≈2.5 mmol CO2 g-1. \\n299 \\nThe lower result was mainly caused by non-quantitative yields of absorption and to a lesser \\n300 \\nextent due to mismatched fitting of experimental data to Schaffe polynomial for points lying \\n301 \\nclose to the corner of the experimental domain. High positive value of b23 in the case of TMG, \\n302 \\nDBU, DABCO indicates a synergy between [bmim][OAc] and the amines that improve the \\n303 \\ncapacity of the system. In the case of [emim][OcSO4] b23 was also high for TMG and DBU.  \\n304 \\nThe 13C NMR investigation (Table 3, Fig. 2) of selected systems confirmed the \\n305 \\npostulated mechanisms of absorption. Comparing with the literature the relative chemical \\n306 \\nshifts of carbamate and HCO3- signals might differ depending on the solvent and amine \\n307 \\n(Umecky et al., 2019). For example Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2017) reported 164.1 ppm and 159.1 \\n308 \\nppm respectively while Zhou (Zhou et al., 2017)163.82 ppm and 160.72 ppm. \\n309 \\n \\n310 \\n \\n311 \\n13 \\n \\n \\n312 \\n \\n313 \\n \\n314 \\nTable 3.

The following conclusions could \\n329 \\nbe drawn: a) the optimal water:amine proportion in terms of CO2 solubility is between 2:1-1:2 \\n330 \\ndepending on the amine; b) in the case of DEA and similar amines capable of forming of \\n331 \\ncarbamates water can be replaced with an IL; c) for tertiary amines reacting towards \\n332 \\nbicarbonate the aqueous amine solution of desired amine:water ratio can be diluted with IL \\n333 \\nwhich leads to slower decrease of overall CO2 solubility than dilution with water only; d) the \\n334 \\n15 \\n \\nuse of [bmim][OAc] or DBU with imidazolium IL leads to considerable absorption by means \\n335 \\nof carboxylation of imidazolium ring and to synergy between the amine and an IL. Because \\n336 \\nDBU has low volatility it is an attractive component of ternary absorbents containing \\n337 \\nimidazolium ILs. \\n338 \\n3.3. Viscosity of hybrid solvents \\n339 \\nA practical application of discussed hybrid solvents would be possible if they had a \\n340 \\nfavorable viscosity prior and after absorption. Earlier publications reported PEG-ILs systems \\n341 \\nas CO2-absorbents exhibited viscosity in the range of 30 to 78 mPa∙s – 10 times lower than for \\n342 \\npure IL (Zhang et al., 2017). The impact of addition of water was clearly visible by examining \\n343 \\nthe kinetics of absorption (Fig. 3). In the case of [emim][OcSO4] the presence of 33% water \\n344 \\nresulted in nearly 300% of increased absorption rate comparing with 1:1 amine:IL solution. In \\n345 \\nthe case of [bmim][OAc] the effect was smaller and no more than 50% of increased rate was \\n346 \\nachieved by the addition of water.  \\n347 \\nA series of solvents were investigated using Cone Plate Rheometer to obtain exact \\n348 \\nvalues of viscosity prior and after CO2 absorption. The results for selected mixtures of high \\n349 \\nabsorption capacity are presented in Table 4.  \\n350 \\n \\n351 \\nFig. 3. Comparison of the course of CO2 absorption in hybrid solvents.

A reasonable values were possible with the \\n364 \\naddition of 33% water which limited the increase of viscosity of post-absorption mixtures \\n365 \\nabove 270 mPa·s-1. The results indicate that mixtures containing [bmim][OAc] are more \\n366 \\nattractive as the viscosity is similar to [emim][OcSO4] but the absorption capacities are higher \\n367 \\nwith the same composition.  \\n368 \\nSome post-absorption mixtures showed an interesting non-Newtonian feature (Fig. 4) \\n369 \\nwhere viscosity was highly affected by the shear rate. In the case of aqueous TMG and DBU \\n370 \\nin [emim][OcSO4] the viscosity decreased with the increasing shear rate. The drop was as \\n371 \\n17 \\n \\nhigh as 50-60%. This could be interesting from technical point of view as flow resistance \\n372 \\nmight be lowered by increasing flow rate.  \\n373 \\n \\n374 \\nFig. 4. Impact of shear rate on the viscosity of hybrid solvents. Arrow indicate the ramp \\n375 \\ndirection. \\n376 \\n \\n377 \\n3.4. Regeneration of selected hybrid solvents \\n378 \\nA various means of regeneration were proposed in the literature for liquid CO2 absorbents. \\n379 \\nIn most cases, including industrial MEA-based process heating to 100-120°C allows full \\n380 \\nregeneration (Aaron and Tsouris, 2005). Some authors applied a combination of heating and \\n381 \\nvacuum desorption (Nii et al., 1995) or purging with inert gas (Z. Li et al., 2019). Because the \\n382 \\ncost of regeneration increases with the heat capacity of absorbent and with the temperature of \\n383 \\nregeneration the possibility of utilization of IL-based absorbents with smaller water content is \\n384 \\neconomically beneficial (Chowdhury et al., 2009; Kim and Svendsen, 2011). We decided to \\n385 \\napply thermal desorption and varied temperature to identify the most promising absorbents. \\n386 \\nUp to 5 cycles of thermal desorption was performed (Fig. 5). \\n387 \\nThe most difficult regeneration was observed for TMG-based absorbents where 2nd and \\n388 \\nfurther cycles showed only 20% of initial capacity. At 120°C the regeneration of \\n389 \\n[bmim][OAc] either in the mixture with DBU or water was difficult and no more than 80% of \\n390 \\ncapacity was retained by pure [bmim][OAc] and 40-50% by mixture with water or DBU. On \\n391 \\nthe other hand mixtures of [emim][OcSO4] with DBU underwent facile regeneration at only \\n392 \\n60°C and 90% of initial capacity was retained. At increased temperature during 4th and 5th \\n393 \\ncycles only a 10% loss of capacity was observed.  \\n394 \\nThe rationale for observed efficiencies is the difference in the reaction type of CO2 \\n395 \\noccurring during absorption. If HCO3- is formed the regeneration is more difficult comparing \\n396 \\n18 \\n \\nwith carboxylation of imidazolium ring. The latter is the main product for [bmim][OAc] or \\n397 \\n[emim][OcSO4]-DBU mixtures. The presence of water in DBU-containing mixtures allowed \\n398 \\nthe formation of HCO3- which reduced the possibility of full regeneration at 60°C which was \\n399 \\npossible for binary [emim][OcSO4]-DBU but not possible for binary [DBU]-H2O. The \\n400 \\nobservations are in line with experimental enthalpies of CO2 fixation in various solvents \\n401 \\nreported in the literature. In the case of amines the average values were 80, 70 and 60 kJ mol-1 \\n402 \\nfor primary, secondary and tertiary amines respectively (Kim and Svendsen, 2011), 55-90 kJ \\n403 \\nmol-1 for amino acids-derived functionalized ILs (Luo and Wang, 2016) while only 40-54 kJ \\n404 \\nmol-1 for absorption involving carboxylation of imidazolium ring (Shaahmadi et al., 2019; \\n405 \\nSong et al., 2019) or 10-20 kJ mol-1 for physical absorption in ILs (Carvalho et al., 2010; Y. \\n406 \\nLi et al., 2019). Such data indicate that imidazolium carboxylation is a very attractive \\n407 \\nmechanism because of low heat of absorption and large theoretical 1:2 or 1:1 molar ratio of \\n408 \\nCO2 fixated per imidazolium ring. \\n409 \\n \\n410 \\n \\n411 \\nFig 5.

Degradation of selected hybrid solvents \\n415 \\nThe stability of solvents for CO2 capture is an important feature considering feasibly of \\n416 \\nindustrial applications. The issue has been extensively studied by various authors in the case \\n417 \\nof thermal degradation of ILs and very good stability up to at least 200°C was demonstrated \\n418 \\nin most cases (Zeng et al., 2017). Another important issue is slow oxidation of amines leading \\n419 \\n19 \\n \\nto numerous products. So far there is little data available besides classic aqueous amine \\n420 \\nsolvents (Chahen et al., 2016; Saeed et al., 2018). Such studies require long (1000 h) \\n421 \\noxidation under realist conditions. In the case of an aqueous piperazines blend 39 oxidation \\n422 \\nproducts was identified responsible for irreversible loss of 0.06-0.2% of amines per day of \\n423 \\noperation in absorption/stripping columns (Cuccia et al., 2018). Similar studies with \\n424 \\nMEA/MDEA identified 22 products and daily loss of 0.03% of amines (Widger et al., 2019).  \\n425 \\nAnother route of much faster degradation that could be important for presented hybrid \\n426 \\nsolvents was amine alkylation by octylsulfate ion (LaFrate et al., 2012) and hydrolysis of \\n427 \\namidine and guanidine bases leading to aminoureas and aminolactams (Hyde et al., 2019). In \\n428 \\norder to quantitatively asses the loss of amines due to those processes a 100 h long heating \\n429 \\n(80°C) in a sealed glass tubes without the presence of oxygen was performed. The results \\n430 \\nwere summarized in Table 5 and Fig. 6.   \\n431 \\n \\n432 \\nTable 5. Amine loss by alkylation or hydrolysis in the amine:[emim][OcSO4]:H2O (1:1:1 \\n433 \\nmass) hybrid solvents. Taging=80°C, aging time= 100 h. Letter in brackets indicate structures of \\n434 \\nidentified products showed in Fig. 5. \\n435 \\n \\n436 \\nAmine loss [%] and the product of degradation \\namine \\nwithout CO2 \\nwith CO2 \\nMEA \\n2 (A) \\n0.5 (A) \\nDEA \\n3.5 (B) \\n0.7 (B) \\nTMG \\n7 (C); 93 (D) \\n20 (C); 9 (D) \\nDBU \\n4 (E); 2 (F) \\n4 (E); 2 (F) \\nDABCO \\n4 (G) \\n4 (G) \\n \\n437 \\n20 \\n \\n \\n438 \\nFig. 6 Alkylation of MEA, DEA, DABCO by [emim][OcSO4] and hydrolysis of TMG and \\n439 \\nDBU observed during the 100 h aging process. \\n440 \\n \\n441 \\n \\nIn the case of MEA, DEA and DABCO the alkylation by octylsulfate ion leads to 0.5-\\n442 \\n3.5% loss of amine. It occurs about much faster in the absence of CO2 in MEA and DEA and \\n443 \\nno difference was detected for DABCO between rich and lean solvent. The observed \\n444 \\ndifferences are most likely the result of formation of carbamates of DEA and MEA upon CO2 \\n445 \\nabsorption which inhibits the alkylation. The impact of pH on the alkylation rate is also a \\n446 \\npossible contribution factor. Considering the lower rate (0.5%) it corresponds to ≈0.1% daily \\n447 \\nloss amine which is comparable or higher to the oxidation rate observed by other authors. As \\n448 \\nthe ILs is also consumed its loss is 3-5 times higher. No alkylation products of TMG or DBU \\n449 \\nwas detected.  \\n450 \\n \\nThe apparent rate of hydrolysis of DBU was higher to the alkylation rate of DEA and \\n451 \\nMEA but was independent on the presence of CO2. Two products were identified which \\n452 \\ncorresponds to a daily amine loss of 1.5%. In the case of TMG the loss was almost \\n453 \\nquantitative without CO2 and the product of hydrolysis (1,1-dimethylurea) formed a \\n454 \\nprecipitate. Approximately only 0.4% of TMG remained in the solution. The presence of CO2 \\n455 \\n21 \\n \\nreduced the rate of hydrolysis and favored the formation of tetramethylurea but the daily loss \\n456 \\nof amine reached as much as 8% which is consistent with the rate of hydrolysis proportional \\n457 \\nto the pH of the solution (Hyde et al., 2019). \\n458 \\n \\nThe data are consistent with the results of regeneration experiments where the \\n459 \\ncapacities of solvents containing TMG quickly upon recycles while DBU-based solvents \\n460 \\nallowed multiple recycles with minimal loss of capacity. It is likely, that the degradation of \\n461 \\namines and  [emim][OcSO4] can be mitigated by optimization of temperature of desorption, \\n462 \\ncareful monitoring of desorption progress and avoiding excessive and prolong heating of \\n463 \\nsolvent streams.  \\n464 \\n \\n465 \\n4. Conclusions \\n466 \\nTernary mixtures of water-IL-amine are interesting absorbents for CO2. Their behavior \\n467 \\nis dependent on the amine and IL type. Two types of quantitative relationship patterns were \\n468 \\nidentified with respect to amine and two with respect to an IL. The observation could be \\n469 \\nuseful in designing absorption processes and the most promising experimental domains for \\n470 \\noptimization purposes. \\n471 \\nThe most promising ternary systems include ionic liquids of chemisorption capacity \\n472 \\nwith a highly basic amine such as DBU. Their low volatility comparing with typically used \\n473 \\namines and their ability to offset the effect of water on IL reactivity towards CO2 are the most \\n474 \\nimportant benefits which potentially reduce the cost of IL-based absorbent and the energy \\n475 \\ndemand for regeneration. DBU also showed relatively low hydrolytic instability comparing \\n476 \\nwith TMG. Moreover, its decomposition does not consume [emim][OcSO4] which is \\n477 \\nsignificant in the case of MEA-, DEA- and DABCO-based hybrids.  \\n478 \\n \\nModerate viscosity of systems containing only 33% of water together with high \\n479 \\ncapacities of amine and low volatility of ILs makes them attractive alternatives for traditional \\n480 \\nbinary aqueous amine absorbents.  \\n481 \\n \\n482 \\n \\n483 \\n \\n484 \\n22 \\n \\nAcknowledgments \\n485 \\nThe results presented in this paper were obtained from research work co-financed by \\n486 \\nthe National Centre of Research and Development in the framework of Contract \\n487 \\nSP/E/1/67484/10 – Strategic Research Program – Advanced technologies for energy \\n488 \\ngeneration: Development of a technology for highly efficient zero-emission coal-fired power \\n489 \\nunits integrated with CO2 capture.

Monoethanolamine (MEA) and sodium\\nglycinate solutions were loaded with CO2 from a mixture of CO2 and N2 (1:9 in\\nvolume ratio) to simulate synthetic flue gas. CO2 desorption from the amine solution\\nwas evaluated using MD at 80 ◦C. Interaction between amines and the membrane\\npolymeric matrix could alter the membrane surface hydrophobicity; however, under all\\nexperimental conditions it was still sufficiently hydrophobic for MD operation. Amine\\nloss during MD operation for CO2 desorption was insignificant. FO was used to provide\\nmake-up water and cooling to the regenerated amine solution after CO2 desorption\\nby MD. The results showed stable FO water flux when wastewater effluent was used\\nas the source for make-up water. Repetitive CO2 loading and desorption experiments\\nshowed 87.0% and 88.1% CO2 re-absorption efficiency for MEA and sodium glycinate in\\nthe second cycle, respectively.

        "Abstract": "'ABSTRACT: To address the problems of the relatively high\\nenergy penalty and corrosivity of aqueous biphasic solvents, a novel\\nnonaqueous biphasic solvent composed of 2-((2-aminoethyl)-\\namino)ethanol (AEEA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and\\nN,N,N′,N″,N″-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) was\\nproposed for CO2 capture. With optimization, this novel AEEA−\\nDMSO−PMDETA (A−D−P) biphasic solvent could achieve a\\nhigh CO2 loading of 1.75 mol·mol−1, of which 96.8% of the\\nabsorbed CO2 was enriched in the lower phase with only 49.6% of\\nthe total volume. 13C NMR analysis and quantum calculations\\nrevealed that A−D−P could absorb CO2 to form not only\\ncarbamate but also carbamic acid species, which were stabilized by\\nDMSO via hydrogen-bonding interactions. Most products were\\nhighly polar and preferred to dissolve in polar DMSO rather than the less polar PMDETA, thus leading to the phase change. The\\nthermodynamics results showed that the heat duty of A−D−P was only 1.66 GJ·ton−1 CO2 (393.15 K), which was signiﬁcantly\\nlower than that of the benchmark MEA (3.59 GJ·ton−1 CO2) and the reported aqueous biphasic solvents. Moreover, A−D−P\\npresented a noncorrosive behavior to steel after CO2 saturation, clearly showing its superiority over MEA and the aqueous biphasic\\nsolvents. Therefore, with superior properties of energy savings and noncorrosiveness, the A−D−P biphasic solvent could be a\\npromising candidate for CO2 capture.'"

Gas chemisorption in the aqueous\\nphase was examined using N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) at 3 mol kg−1 concentration and piperazine (PZ) at concentrations\\nranging from 0.3 to 0.9 mol kg−1. The first stage was to assess the effectiveness of the microemulsion system in comparison to that of\\nthe nonemulsion system for gas absorption. Then, the aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of PZ in combination with an amine. The\\nresults clearly validate the superior gas absorption performance of the microemulsion system compared to that of the nonemulsion\\nsystem. Furthermore, concerning the effectiveness of PZ, the results indicate that PZ is more efficient at low partial pressures of\\ncarbon dioxide than at high pressures. An interesting observation is that in a solution with a constant concentration of MDEA and\\nPZ, as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide gas changes, PZ performs optimally at a partial pressure of 0.3 bar. Additionally, the\\nresults obtained confirm the linearity of the relationship between the mole fraction of PZ in the MDEA/PZ solution and the carbon\\ndioxide loading of the MDEA/PZ solution within this pressure range.'"
