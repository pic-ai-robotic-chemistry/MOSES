Aqueous amines have excellent selectivity, but\\npresent corrosion and volatility issues, whereas ionic liquids (ILs) have negligible\\nvolatility and tunable physical properties, but high viscosities. One approach to improve\\nthe practical performance of these liquids is encapsulating them in a CO2 permeable\\npolymer shell to enhance the accessibility of the liquid and the CO2 absorption rate. In\\nthis work, we report the encapsulation of a mixture of amine and IL (i.e.,\\nmonoethanolamine (MEA) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate\\n([BMIM][BF4])) and demonstrate enhanced carbon capture performance. A soft-\\ntemplate approach and interfacial polymerization are used to give capsules with liquid\\ncore (64 wt %) and polyurea shell. Compared to the bulk liquid, the encapsulated liquid\\nshows improved thermal stability over cycles of absorption at 25 °C, and desorption at 75\\n°C. The capsules with core of [BMIM][BF4]-MEA show 0.2 mol CO2/kg of capsules at 1\\nbar CO2, compared to the bulk liquid, which has 0.05 mol CO2/kg of sorbent. This is attributed to the limited evaporation of the\\namines. Alternatively, the same capsules but with 5 wt % of piperazine (Pz) in the core have doubled gravimetric CO2 capacity of the\\ncapsules (0.4 mol CO2/kg of capsules); performance is evaluated over 10 capture−release cycles showing minimal mass loss.\\nCharacterization of the CO2 uptake of the polymer shell itself reveals that the shell contributes only ∼10% of the observed capacity,\\nlikely attributed to amine functionalities of the polymer.

To overcome these challenges, three \\nmodified heterogeneous mesoporous catalysts, CMK-3-SiO2, CMK-3-MCM-41, CMK-3-SBA-15, \\nand SO42-/ZrO2 solid acid catalyst were initially synthesized and investigated to determine their \\ncatalytic effectiveness in the process of CO2 and MEA solvent regeneration with CO2 loading of \\n0.5±0.02 mol CO2/mol MEA at 97oC. According to the experimental results, the CMK-3 modified \\ncatalyst significantly decreases the energy requirement for CO2 desorption. The catalytic \\nperformance of the synthesized catalysts was in the order of CMK-3-SiO2 > CMK-3-MCM-\\n41>CMK-3-SBA-15>SZ respectively. CMK-3-SiO2 exhibited the best catalytic performance by \\nenhancing desorption rate by 195%, and decreasing the energy requirement by 37.41% compared \\nwith the monoethanol amine as a blank run. Furthermore, the CMK-3-SiO2 catalyst exhibited the \\nbest catalytic performance compared to the literature with an excellent stability and with no \\nunfavorable effects on the MEA-CO2 absorption activity for the regenerated amine solvent. This \\nperformance seems to be a result of the large mesoporous surface area (BET) and large number of \\nBrϕnsted and Lewis acid sites. In addition, a reasonable reaction mechanism for the amine solvent \\nregeneration with the CMK-3 heterogeneous catalyst is proposed. \\nKeywords: CO2 capture process, Amine solvent regeneration, Energy penalty, Modified \\nheterogeneous catalysts, desorption rate. \\n \\n \\nPage 2 of 35\\nACS Paragon Plus Environment\\nACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\n46\\n47\\n48\\n49\\n50\\n51\\n52\\n53\\n54\\n55\\n56\\n57\\n58\\n59\\n60\\n \\n3\""

The relationships between activator properties and CO2 capture performance, such\\nas absorption capacity, regeneration eﬃciency, and corrosion behavior, were investigated. The results showed\\nthat the non-aqueous AMP-AEEA (2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethanol)-NMP solution not only possessed high CO2\\ncapacity (1.65 mol·kg−1 solution) but also retained nearly 90% of its initial CO2 capacity after the 4th cycle of\\nregeneration. Moreover, it presented a non-corrosive behavior after saturated absorption, clearly showing its\\nsuperiority over the benchmark monoethanolamine (MEA) solution. The 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\\nspectra provided evidence of CO2 reacting with AMP-AEEA in NMP to form carbamates, which could be easily\\nregenerated under thermal desorption. The speciﬁc solvent loss was 0.14 kg⋅kg−1 CO2 and the total heat duty of\\nAMP-AEEA-NMP solution was only about half that of the MEA solution, which can be attributed to the absence of\\nwater and properties of the inert organic solvent. With the perfect CO2 capture performance, non-corrosive\\nbehavior, and signiﬁcant reduction of energy consumption, the novel solution is a promising candidate for CO2\\ncapture.'"

In this sense, partial oxy-combustion emerges as a promising alternative. Its advantages rely on the produc-\\ntion of a higher CO2 concentration ﬂue gas than these provided by conventional air-ﬁring processes. The use of higher CO2 con-\\ncentrations should improve the solvent kinetic and the CO2 cyclic capacity.\\nRESULTS: The kinetic behaviour of two representative sterically hindered amines, namely 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP)\\nand isophrondiamine (IF), were studied under partial oxy-combustion conditions in a laboratory-scale semi-batch reactor. The\\nCO2 concentration varied from 15%v/v to 60%v/v. The kinetic enhancement experienced by AMP at high CO2 concentration was\\nslightly >60%, instead of 70–80% for IF. AMP also improved its CO2 absorption capacity by 24.7%, from 15%v/v to 60%v/v,\\nalmost doubled the improvements achieved by monoethanolamine (MEA). In the case of IF experiments, the CO2 loading\\nincreased ≈10% from 15%v/v to 60%v/v CO2 and it changed from 1.10 to 1.34 mol CO2 mol–1 solvent, representing a >20%\\nincrease.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The presence of higher CO2 concentrations accelerated CO2 absorption and provided higher CO2 absorption\\nrates. In addition, the evolution of the CO2 loading also exhibited higher values in the experiments using higher CO2 concen-\\ntration ﬂue gas. The steric hindrance causes a hybrid behaviour in these solvents, between both fast and slow kinetic solvents.\\nThe kinetic rates observed using AMP were slightly higher than MEA, but lower than IF which showed the fastest kinetics.\\n© 2020 Society of Chemical Industry\\nKeywords: carbon capture; kinetics; clean processes; separation; emissions; pollution control\\nNOMENCLATURE\\nChemicals\\nAMP, (−)\\n2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol\\nIF, (−)\\nisophorondiamine\\nMEA, (−)\\nmonoethanolamine\\nSymbols - Reactions\\nAmH (−)\\nAmine\\nAmH2\\n+ (−)\\nAmine protonated\\nAmCOO−(−)\\nCarbamate\\nAmH+COO−(−)\\nZwitterion intermediate\\nB (−)\\nBase\\nBH+ (−)\\nBase protonated\\nCO2 (−)\\nCarbon dioxide\\nH+ (−)\\nHydron\\nHCO3\\n−(−)\\nBicarbonate\\nH2O (−)\\nWater\\nOH−(−)\\nHydroxide ion\\nSymbols – Equations\\n[AmH]\\n(kmol m–3)\\nAmine concentration\\n[B] (kmol m–3)\\nBase concentration\\n[CO2] (kmol m–3)\\nCarbon dioxide concentration\\n[CO2]IN (vol%)\\nCarbon dioxide inlet concentration\\n[CO2]OUT (vol%)\\nCarbon dioxide outlet concentration\\n[H2O] (kmol m–3)\\nWater concentration\\n[OH−] (kmol m–3)\\nHydroxide ion concentration\\n⊍(mol CO2 mol–1\\nsolvent)\\nCO2 loading\\n⊍* (mol CO2 mol–\\n1 solvent)\\nCO2 loading at equilibrium\\nk1 (m3 kmol•s–1)\\nForward reaction rate constant for CO2\\nabsorption reaction via zwitterion\\nk-1 (s−1)\\nBackward reaction rate constant for CO2\\nabsorption reaction via zwitterion\\nkb (m3 kmol•s–1)\\nForward reaction rate constant for zwitter-\\nion hydrolysis reaction\\n* Corresponding to: Fernando Vega, Chemical and Environmental Engineering\\nDepartment, School of Engineering, University of Seville, C/ Camino de los Des-\\ncubrimientos, s/n 41092 Sevilla, Spain.

This paper contains the synthesis process along with the structure \\n12 \\nconfirmation using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR, and mass spectroscopy. Density, viscosity, and diffusivity are \\n13 \\nmeasured at different ranges with standard instruments. The kinetic studies were also conducted in a standard \\n14 \\npredefined-interface stirred-cell reactor. The kinetic parameters were calculated at different parameters like \\n15 \\nagitation speeds, absorption temperature, initial concentrations of ionic liquid, and partial pressure of carbon \\n16 \\ndioxide. The reaction regime of carbon dioxide absorption is found to be in fast reaction kinetics with pseudo \\n17 \\nfirst order. The reaction rate and the activation energy of CO2 absorption are experimentally determined in the \\n18 \\nrange of 299 K to 333K with different initial concentrations of ionic liquid (0.1-1.1 kmol/m3). The second order \\n19 \\nrate constant and activation energy of carbon dioxide absorption in the synthesized ionic liquid is found to be \\n20 \\n(6385.93 to 12632.01 m3 mol-1 s-1) and 16.61 kJ mol−1 respectively. This solvent has shown great potential to \\n21 \\nabsorb CO2 at large scale. \\n22 \\nKeywords: Protic Ionic Liquids (PILs); Gas-Liquid Interface; NMR; FTIR; Carbon-dioxide Absorption; \\n23 \\nStirred-Cell Reactor; Kinetic Studies. \\n \\n24 \\n2 | P a g e  \\n \\nAbbreviations \\n25 \\nA \\nArrhenius Pre-exponential factor, m3/mol s \\na \\nvolumetric Gas-Liquid Interfacial Area, m-1 \\nB \\nbase (water) \\nCA \\nthe concentration of species A in the liquid phase in the foam film, k mol/m3 \\nCB \\nthe concentration of reactant B in the liquid phase in the storage section at time t, k mol/m3 \\nCB0 \\nthe initial concentration of reactant B in the liquid stream entering the storage section, k mol/m3 \\nCTETAL \\ninitial Concentration of [TETA] [Lactate], k mol/m3 \\nCO2 \\nCarbon-dioxide gas \\nC2,i \\nCO2 concentration at G-L interface, mol/m3 \\nDA \\nthe diffusion coefficient of reactant A in the liquid phase, m2/s \\n𝐷𝐶𝑂2 \\ndiffusion coefficient of carbon dioxide in the [TETA] [Lactate] solution, m2 /s \\n𝐷𝐶𝑂2\\n𝐻2𝑂 \\ndiffusivity of CO2 in water, m2/s \\n𝐷𝑆 \\nthe diameter of impeller blades in the liquid-phase, m \\n𝐷𝑆𝑡𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑑−𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 \\nthe inner diameter of stirred tank reactor, m \\n𝐸𝑎 \\nActivation energy, kJ/mol \\nEA \\nenhancement Factor \\nEi \\ninstantaneous enhancement factor \\nG-L \\nGas-Liquid Interface \\n𝐻𝐶𝑂2 \\nHenry’s constant for carbon-dioxide on [TETA] [Lactate] solution \\nHa \\nHatta Number \\nILs \\nionic Liquids \\n𝑘𝑙𝑎 \\nvolumetric mass transfer coefficient, m/s \\n𝑘−1 \\nthe backward first-order reaction rate constant, s \\n𝑘2 \\nthe forward second-order reaction rate constant for the formation of the zwitterion, m3/mol. s \\n𝑘𝑜𝑣 \\noverall pseudo-first order reaction rate constant, s-1 \\n𝑘𝐵 \\nRate constant for the deprotonation of the zwitterion by a base, m3/ mol. s \\nn \\nnumber of moles, k mol \\n \\n \\n26 \\n3 | P a g e'"

In this study, the concentration range of both tertiary amine and MEA were\\nchosen to be 0.2–0.4 kmol/m3 with a temperature range of 293–313 K under non-aqueous conditions. The model\\nbased on the termolecular reaction mechanism is proposed to interpret the experimental kinetic data of the\\nreaction occurred in the non-aqueous blended amine systems, and the results indicate that the model is well\\nﬁtted to the experimental data with an AARD of 5.70% for DEEA-MEA-Ethanol system and 6.53% for DMEA-\\nMEA-Ethanol system. Blended amines show many advantages in kinetics because of the existence of the inter-\\naction between the tertiary amine and MEA. The kinetics behaviors of CO2 absorbed in the two non-aqueous\\nblended amine systems are discussed in brief according to the molecular structures of the two tertiary amines.\\nDiﬀerent from the traditional aqueous systems, this study proved that tertiary amine enhanced the ability of\\nprimary amine to absorb CO2 which is due to tertiary amine didn’t react with CO2 directly in a non-aqueous\\nsystem. The result in the non-aqueous system also shows that DMEA is more easily participate in the termole-\\ncular reaction between MEA and CO2 compared with DEEA, which indicate the length of alkyl chain on nitrogen\\natom also plays an important role in the enhancement eﬀect. Additionally, after comparing the kinetic data of\\nthe two blended amine systems under aqueous and non-aqueous conditions, it can be found that tertiary amine\\ncan participate in the termolecular reaction between MEA and CO2, and that the protonated MEA can be re-\\nconverted to free MEA by the tertiary amine, making it easier for MEA to participate in its own termolecular\\nreactions, so that the overall reaction rate of the blended amine system is accelerated.

A surrogate model can \\nbe constructed by fitting the input-output data generated by process simulation and optimization with \\nthe rigorous model. Following the proposed method, surrogate models for the amine-based CO2 capture \\nprocesses with two representative types of amines, monoethanolamine (MEA) and piperazine (PZ), are \\nconstructed and validated. The constructed surrogate models predict the specific steam consumption \\nrate and total equipment purchase cost based on the input information of desired capture rate and CO2 \\nsource stream condition. The predicted information is shown to agree well with the simulation result of \\nthe rigorous first principles model. This surrogate modeling approach can be applied to compare \\ndifferent capture technologies in the context of analyzing and synthesizing a larger CCUS processing \\nnetwork.\\nKeywords: carbon capture, surrogate model, amine scrubbing, process optimization, techno-economic \\nevaluation\\nPage 2 of 40\\nACS Paragon Plus Environment\\nIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\n46\\n47\\n48\\n49\\n50\\n51\\n52\\n53\\n54\\n55\\n56\\n57\\n58\\n59\\n60\\n3\\n\\uf06e'"

In this\\ncontext, the synthesis of the IL GLYMIM[Cl] was performed, followed by ion exchange processes to\\nachieve GLYMIM variants with diverse counter anions (NTf2−, PF6−, and BF4). Subsequently, PIL\\nmembranes were fabricated from these tailored ILs and subjected to characterization, employing\\ntechniques such as SEC, FTIR, DSC, TGA, DMA, FEG-SEM, and CO2 sorption analysis using the\\npressure decay method.

The amine-functionalized BFA (BFA−APTES)\\nwas fully characterized by employing a range of characterization\\ntechniques. Adsorption behavior of BFA−APTES was evaluated\\nagainst two anionic dyes, namely, alizarin red S (ARS) and\\nbromothymol blue (BTB). In the course of experimental data\\nanalysis, the computation tools of data ﬁtting for linear and\\nnonlinear form of Langmuir, Freundlich, and the modiﬁed\\nLangmuir−Freundlich adsorption isotherms were used with the aid of Matlab R2019b. In order to highlight the misuse of\\nlinearization of adsorption models, the sum of the squares of residues (SSE) values obtained from nonlinear models are compared\\nwith R2 values obtained from the linear regression. The accuracy of the data ﬁtting was checked by the use of SSE as an error\\nfunction instead of the coeﬃcient of determination, R2. The dye adsorption capacity of BFA−APTES was also compared with the\\nnonfunctionalized BFA. The maximum adsorption capacities of BFA−APTES for ARS and BTB dye molecules were calculated to be\\naround 13.42 and 15.44 mg/g, respectively. This value is approximately 2−3 times higher than the pristine BFA. A reasonable\\nagreement between the calculated and experimental values of qe obtained from the nonlinear form of kinetic models veriﬁed the\\nimportance of using equations in their original form. The experimentally calculated thermodynamic parameters including molar\\nstandard Gibbs free energy (ΔadGm\\n0 ) and molar standard enthalpy change (ΔadHm\\n0 ) reﬂected that the process of adsorption of dye\\nmolecules on the BFA−APTES adsorbent was spontaneous and exothermic in nature. Moreover, the used BFA−APTES adsorbent\\ncould be regenerated and reused for several cycles with signiﬁcant dye adsorption capacity. The remediation capability of the BFA−\\nAPTES adsorbent against ARS dye was also demonstrated by packing a small column ﬁlled with the BFA−APTES adsorbent and\\npassing a solution of ARS through it.

The variable operating conditions\\nincluded lean loading (0.19−0.25 m CO2/mol alkalinity), gas temperature (40, 78 °C), and intercooling temperature (35, 40\\n°C). Using 5 m PZ CO2 removal from 82% to 96% was achieved with intercooling and only 12 m of packing. A rigorous, rate-\\nbased absorber model accurately predicted the CO2 removal and temperature proﬁle. The model shows that the delta loading of\\nthe solvent at NGCC conditions for 90% removal is greater than at coal conditions, but high CO2 removal (99%) is more\\ndiﬃcult to achieve with NGCC gas than with coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. The pump-around intercooling was eﬀective, and the\\nintercooling temperature had a large impact on the absorber performance.

        "Abstract": "'Abstract: The present study analyzes the features of chemical CO2 absorption using tertiary amine\\nsolvents by comparing the absorption performance and electrical properties between\\nmethyl-di-ethanolamine (MDEA) and tri-ethanolamine (TEA) systems. The results are mostly attributed\\nto the different structures of the two amine molecules. Absorption performance is significantly affected\\nby the molecular structure and water concentration in the amine solution. The absorption performance\\nof the MDEA system is better than that of TEA, which is basically ascribed to the MDEA molecule’s\\nmore asymmetric and irregular shape than that of TEA, which thus enhances the catalytic activity of\\nMDEA and the reactivity of the −OH moiety in water. The difference of electrical properties such as\\nionic conductivities (ICs) of the two protonated amines and real ionic activity coefficients (RIAC)\\nbetween the two systems might be also caused by the different molecular structures of the two amines.\\nThe IC of protonated MDEA is estimated to be 23.70% higher than that of protonated TEA, because of\\nthe higher ionic mobility and charge density of MDEA. The RIAC of the MDEA system is higher than that\\nof TEA, which is explained by the different physicochemical interactions between the molecules in the\\ntwo systems. Since water is one of the reactants in the absorption, its concentration in solution\\nsignificantly affects the results of the systems. In addition, the absorption using tertiary amine is a\\nbase-catalyzed reaction, and thus variations of the overall absorption rate follow a parabolic curve.\\nTherefore, it is maximized to be 14.2 and 9.8 mmol CO2·L−1·min−1 in the 15 wt% MDEA and TEA\\nsolutions, respectively.

To over-\\ncome these limitations, for the ﬁrst time in this study, amine based deep eutectic solvents (DES) are\\nincorporated into membranes for CO2 capture. Three different alkanolamines; monoethanolamine,\\n(MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), triethanolamine (TEA) were selected as HBDs and choline chloride as\\nHBA.

The single-crystal\\nX-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that all the MOFs feature a\\nsimilar type of three-dimensional structure having a binuclear\\n[Cd2(COO)4(N)4] secondary building block unit. Moreover,\\nMOFs 1 and 2 contain one-dimensional channels along the b-\\naxis, whereas MOF 3 possesses a 1D channel along the a-axis. In these MOFs, the pores are decorated with multifunctional groups,\\ni.e., halogen and amine. The gas adsorption analysis of these MOFs demonstrate that they display high uptake of CO2 (up to 5.34\\nmmol/g) over N2 and CH4. The isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) value for CO2 at zero loadings is in the range of 18−26 kJ mol−1.\\nIn order to understand the mechanism behind the better adsorption of CO2 by our MOFs, we have also performed configurational\\nbias Monte Carlo simulation studies, which confirm that the interaction between our MOFs and CO2 is stronger compared to those\\nwith N2 and CH4. Various noncovalent interactions, e.g., halogen (X)···O, Cd···O, and O···O, between CO2 and the halogen atom,\\nthe Cd(II) metal center, and the carboxylate group from the MOFs are observed, respectively, which may be a reason for the higher\\ncarbon dioxide adsorption. Ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) calculations of MOF 1 demonstrate that the obtained selectivity\\nvalues for CO2/CH4 (50:50) and CO2/N2 (15:85) are ca. 28 and 193 at 273 K, respectively. However, upon increasing the\\ntemperature to 298 K, the selectivity value (S = 34) decreases significantly for the CO2/N2 mixture. We have also calculated the\\nbreakthrough analysis curves for all the MOFs using mixtures of CO2/CH4 (50:50) and CO2/N2 (50:50 and 15:85) at different\\nentering gas velocities and observed larger retention times for CO2 in comparison with other gases, which also signifies the stronger\\ninteraction between our MOFs and CO2. Moreover, due to the presence of Lewis acidic metal centers, these MOFs act as\\nheterogeneous catalysts for the CO2 fixation reactions with different epoxides in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide\\n(TBAB), for conversion into industrially valuable cyclic carbonates. These MOFs exhibit a high conversion (96−99%) of\\nepichlorohydrin (ECH) to the corresponding cyclic carbonate 4-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-2-one after 12 h of reaction time at 1\\nbar of CO2 pressure, at 65 °C.

It was shown that, starting from \\nan aqueous amine solution, the replacement of a small part of the amine by choline chloride does not signifi\\xad\\ncantly influence the moles of the absorbed CO2 per mole of amine, but reduces the CO2 solubility in the bulk, \\nexpressed as moles of CO2 per kg of solvent. Furthermore, it was shown that if a small part of water is replaced by \\ncholine chloride, the CO2 solubility in the bulk is not significantly altered. Moreover, the addition of water favors \\nthe chemical absorption, as the experimental results show increased absorbed moles of CO2 per mole of amine. \\nHowever, such phenomenon is not enough to compensate for the rather low CO2 solubility in water and the \\noverall absorption ability of the aqueous DES solution, expressed in moles of CO2 per kg of solvent, decreases. \\nThe modified Kent-Eisenberg model satisfactorily correlates the experimental data showing deviations that range \\nbetween 0.4–6.6 % in all cases. The model predictions for the speciation in the loaded solutions reveal that the \\nunreacted amine content is very low at CO2 partial pressures of the order of 1 kPa and that the increase of CO2 \\nsolubility at higher partial pressures is attributed to the hydrolysis of the carbamate and the molecular CO2 \\ndissolution.'"

The \\nperstraction provides selective extraction of HSS anions without direct mixing of liquid phases or the formation of \\nstable emulsions of the solvent and the extractant. For this purpose, a number of industrial and laboratory porous \\nmembrane samples fabricated from polyvinylidene fluoride, polypropylene, and polysulfone were investigated. \\nTheir chemical and morphological stability, surface properties, and transport properties were tested under prolonged \\n(>600\\xa0h) contact with a model solvent (an aqueous monoethanolamine solution) and with the components of the \\nselective extractant.

A fast CO2 absorption rate is preferred to reduce the capital cost of the\\nabsorber. In this work, the CO2 absorption rate (kg′) of the biphasic solvent was measured in a wetted wall\\ncolumn at 40 °C and at the loading conditions in the absorber. At CO2 equilibrium partial pressure (PCO2*) lower\\nthan 100 Pa, 25% AEEA/50% DEEA is homogeneous. The CO2 absorption rate, kg′, is as fast as 30% PZ (3 times\\nfaster than 30% MEA). When PCO2* is greater than 100 Pa, 25% AEEA/50% DEEA forms aqueous and organic\\nphases after CO2 absorption.

However, extensive energy input and severe\\nequipment corrosion constitute their major and inherent drawbacks due to the involvement of\\nvast amounts of water as the diluent. Water-lean absorbents are proposed to deliver potential\\nbeneﬁts, such as higher capacity and enhanced energy eﬃciency, by abandoning the aqueous\\nsolvent or replacing it with organic counterparts. Great eﬀorts have been devoted to the\\ndevelopment of CO2 capture protocols under nonaqueous circumstance, but their industrial\\ndeployment is still challenged by the exponentially increasing viscosity during operation. In this\\nwork, a series of alkoxy-functionalized methylamines have been devised as single-component\\npostcombustion CO2 absorbents under water-lean condition. These nonaqueous amines are\\ncapable of reversibly capturing CO2 with low viscosities (48−114 cP at 25 °C and 27−63 cP at\\n40 °C) at their maximal gravimetric capacities (15−21 wt % at 25 °C and 14−21 wt % at 40\\n°C). Comprehensive mechanistic studies by means of in situ Fourier transform infrared\\nspectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and control experiments revealed that the\\nstabilization of sequestered CO2 via intramolecular hydrogen bonding between in situ formed carbamic acid and the ﬂexible alkoxy\\nside chain of the designed amines would play the key role in enhancing both the capacity and ﬂowability. Meanwhile, thermal\\ndesorption of the captured CO2 could easily be carried out at a feasible temperature (75 °C) under ambient pressure, and the CO2-\\nsaturated absorbents have remained intact at 80 °C for 2 days within a closed system. Furthermore, these novel amines would exhibit\\nconsiderable physisorption by operating at high-pressure conditions (20 and 30 bar), thanks to the inherent CO2-philicity of the\\nalkoxy functionality. Hence, the integration of enhanced capacity, reduced operating viscosity, and mild regeneration makes such\\nalkoxy-functionalized methylamine-type absorbent a compelling candidate for practical application.'"

Conventionally, MOFs are synthesized \\nat lab-scale using organic solvent-based systems, leading to high environmental burdens and high operating \\ncosts, which ultimately hinders the large-scale production and application of MOFs. Aqueous synthesis of \\nMOFs overcomes such difficulty by eliminating the organic solvent, which makes it an environmental-\\nfriendlier and economically-favorable alternative to the current production method. However, further \\n2 \\n \\nquantitative analysis is required to compare the environmental and economic performances of the two \\nmethods. Here, we used life cycle assessment (LCA) coupled with techno-economic analysis (TEA) to \\nevaluate the environmental and economic performances of different UiO-66-NH2 production methods. \\nWhen the solvothermal method was replaced by the aqueous solution-based method, the LCA and TEA \\nresults suggest the environmental burdens and cost of UiO-66-NH2 production were reduced by up to 91% \\nand 84%, respectively. By using aqueous solution-based method, the cradle to gate carbon footprint and \\nproduction cost of UiO-66-NH2 were estimated to be 43 kg CO2 eq/kg and $15.8/kg, respectively. We \\nfurther applied our LCA results to reassess the role of UiO-66-NH2 in carbon capture and storage (CCS) \\nand compare its environmental performance with current benchmark (amine-based solvent). Our results \\nshow that UiO-66-NH2 could potentially have better environmental performance than the amine-based \\nsolvent if the number of regeneration cycles is greater than 1513. This work is the first comprehensive \\nLCA-TEA study that quantifies the substantial environmental and economic benefits of using the aqueous \\nsolution-based systems to produce UiO-66-NH2, and the analysis in this work is intended to be a starting \\npoint for further systematic studies on the full life-cycle impacts of MOFs.'"

Both so-\\nlubility and kinetics of CO2 absorption are found to enhance significantly due to addition of small amount of\\nHMDA in the aqueous SG solvent. CO2 loading data is correlated using modified Kent-Eisenberg model. For\\ndeveloping kinetic model, overall rate is assumed to be the combined rate contribution of CO2-HMDA and CO2-\\nSG reaction system.

Our hybrid approach\\ninvolves using classical molecular dynamics simulations with the general amber force ﬁeld (GAFF) and\\nsemi-empirical AM1−BCC charges (GAFF/AM1−BCC) in the solution phase, combined with high-level\\ncomposite quantum chemical ideal-gas calculations. We ﬁrst determined a new force ﬁeld (FF) for the\\nhydronium ion (H3O+) by matching to the single experimental pKa data point for the well-known\\nmonoethanolamine system at 298.15 K. We then used this FF to predict the pKa values for 76 other amines\\nat 298.15 K and for all 77 amines at elevated temperatures. Additionally, we indirectly relate the H3O+\\nhydration free energy to that of H+ and provide expressions for intrinsic hydration free energy and enthalpy\\nof the proton. Using the derived H3O+ FF, we predicted the pKa values of a diverse set of alkanolamines\\nwith an overall average absolute deviation of less than 0.72 pKa units. Furthermore, the derived H3O+ FF is\\nable to predict the protonation enthalpy of these amines when used with the GAFF. We also predicted the carbamate reversion\\nconstants of the primary and secondary amine species in the data set and their corresponding standard heats of reaction, which we\\ncompared with the scarcely available experimental data, which are often subject to signiﬁcant uncertainty. Finally, we also described\\nthe inﬂuence of electronic and steric eﬀects of diﬀerent molecular fragments/groups on the stabilities of the carbamates.'"

CO2 can react with these amines, forming unstable carbamates and protonated amines in the\\nEGBE solvent, whereas it forms bicarbonate species in addition to ionic couples in aqueous solutions. The regeneration heat duty of\\nnonaqueous EGBE-based secondary amine absorbents was about 45−55% lower than that of aqueous MEA (3.82 MJ kg−1 CO2).

While these\\napproaches remained successful in removing CO2 from ﬂue gas, the exact\\nrole of hydrophobicity towards CO2 separation is not yet validated in the\\nliterature. In this current study, an amine-ampliﬁed chemically reactive\\ncoating on ﬁbrous cotton has been unprecedentedly developed for facile\\ntailoring of diﬀerent water wettability through the 1,4-conjugate addition\\nreaction under ambient conditions. Further, these amine-ampliﬁed\\ninterfaces having tailored water wettability were extended to investigate\\nindependently the role of: (a) amine ampliﬁcation and (b) hydrophobicity on the performance of CO2 separation at room\\ntemperature and atmospheric pressure. The increased hydrophobicity on the amine-ampliﬁed interface played an important role in\\nimproving the CO2 uptake from 24 mmol/L (water contact angle (WCA) of 86°) to 63 mmol/L (WCA of 151°). However,\\nsuperhydrophobic coating that lacked the amine ampliﬁcation process displayed a poor (7 mmol/L) CO2 separation performance.\\nThus, controlled amalgamation of amine ampliﬁcation and bioinspired superhydrophobicity in ﬁbrous cotton lead to a synergistic\\nimpact towards eﬃcient CO2 separation at ambient temperature and pressure, irrespective of the level of humidity present during the\\ncourse of the experiments. Thus, this current study would allow to design a more potent CO2 removal material by strategic\\nassociation of porosity, amine modulation, and liquid wettability.\\nKEYWORDS: reactive superhydrophobicity, amine ampliﬁcation, chemically reactive, CO2 separation, tailored wettability'"

To identify tertiary amines that absorb CO2\\nfaster, it would be eﬃcacious to have a quantitative and predictive\\nmodel of the rate-controlling processes. Despite numerous\\nattempts to date, this goal has been elusive. The present\\ncomputational approach achieves this goal by focusing on the\\nreaction of CO2 with OH−forming HCO3\\n−. The performance of\\nthe resulting model is demonstrated for a consistent experimental\\ndata set of the absorption rates of CO2 for 24 diﬀerent aqueous\\ntertiary amine solvents. The key to the new model’s success is the manner in which the free energy barrier for the reaction of CO2\\nwith OH−is evaluated from the diﬀerences among the solvation free energies of CO2, OH−, and HCO3\\n−, while the pKa of the\\namines controls the concentration of OH−. These solvation energies are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. The\\nexperimental value of the free energy of reaction of CO2 with pure water is combined with information about measured rates of\\nabsorption of CO2 in an aqueous amine solvent in order to calibrate the absorption rate model. This model achieves a relative\\naccuracy better than 0.1 kJ mol−1 for the free energies of activation for CO2 absorption in aqueous amine solutions and 0.07 g L−1\\nmin−1 for the absorption rate of CO2.

A high intermolecular interaction intensity promotes CO2 ab\\xad\\nsorption, while intra-molecular interaction intensity affects CO2 desorption during the regeneration process. \\nDiffusivity is also an important factor for a fast CO2 uptake rate, which is desirable for efficient CO2 capture. The \\ninterpretation of diffusivity and intermolecular interaction intensity findings is conducted through mean square \\ndisplacement and radial distribution function analysis, respectively.

        "Abstract": "'A B S T R A C T\\nAqueous ammonia is one of the most promising solvents to conventional amine for capturing CO2 from flue gas\\nand other industrial emissions owing to its high CO2 loading capacity, low-cost, less corrosive, and low\\nvulnerability to degradation. However, due to the slow absorption rate of CO2, the industrial application of\\nammonia is restricted. The present review mainly focused on the current developments of the aqueous ammonia-\\nbased carbon capture process (AAP) and its enhancement technologies to improve the absorption rate perfor-\\nmance. The reaction between aqueous ammonia and CO2, including reaction mechanism, reaction intermediates,\\nreaction products, and influence of different operational parameters on the absorption performance, are pre-\\nsented. The enhancement technologies, mass transfer coefficients, and perspectives for each potential technology\\nin AAP are reviewed. Furthermore, the recent advances in the potential of ammonia for combined removal of\\nseveral flue gas components such as; NOx, SOx, CO2, and other pollutants are discussed. Finally, in light of recent\\nadvancements and obstacles of AAP, this study provides views and highlights in which future prospective\\ninvestigation is necessary to improve the absorption rate of aqueous ammonia.'"

The analysis of HRSG using flue gases from \\nmethane and syngas is performed by calculating the enthalpy of flue gas, rate of heat exchange, and temperature \\ndistribution of each component of HRSG.

Conventional systems using mostly amine solutions to cap-\\nture carbon dioxide at the source have some disadvantages, and alternatives are con-\\nstantly being searched. In this work, a benign system of aqueous calcium acetate\\nsolution was investigated for this purpose. Calcium acetate is easy to produce, rela-\\ntively cheap, environmentally friendly, nonhazardous, and noncorrosive. These prop-\\nerties make it a great alternative for use in capturing carbon dioxide. This absorp-\\ntion process is accompanied by chemical reaction. Therefore, the reaction kinetics\\nneeds to be investigated before its use in absorbers. A stirred cell reactor was used\\nin the experiments using aqueous calcium acetate solution of different concentra-\\ntions (2-20% w/w) and different carbon dioxide concentrations in gas mixtures (4.5-\\n100% v/v dry carbon dioxide) at temperatures ranging from 286 to 352 K. The Gibbs\\nfree energy change for the overall reaction between carbon dioxide and aqueous cal-\\ncium acetate solution was found to be –2.75 kJ/mol that shows the reaction is exer-\\ngonic and occurs spontaneously. It was also found out that the reaction is pseudo–first\\norder with respect to carbon dioxide which was also proven by calculating the Hatta\\nnumber.

Tests of the solubility\\nof CO2 in water were carried out to validate the experimental setup. CO2 capture testing was\\naccomplished using EDA in aqueous solutions (0, 5, 10, and 20 wt.% in amine). Finally, a kinetic\\nmodel involving two steps was proposed, including a rapid absorption step and a slow diffusion step.\\nEDA accelerated the CO2 capture performance.

From our previous work, the novel diamine absorbents\\nN,N-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine (DMPDA) and N,N-dimethyl-1,2-ethanediamine\\n(DMEDA), also utilizing N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as a non-aqueous diluent\\nto reduce the water content of the absorbent, were demonstrated to produce an\\nabsorbent blend with a significantly lower overall energy consumption (for CO2\\nregeneration). Alongside the thermodynamic performance, CO2 absorption mass\\ntransfer plays an equally critical role in the overall performance of an absorbent for\\nCO2 capture processes. Gaining an understanding of the fundamental factors\\ninfluencing mass transfer behavior has long been the focus of research efforts, and\\nthe diffusivity of the absorbent molecules is a critical factor for amines to be able to\\nrapidly react with CO2.

A key of CCS technology is to\\nseek the absorbent with low cost, fast absorption rate, and high stability. In this study, we show that\\n2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole is particularly suitable for efﬁcient CO2 capture. The aqueous solution of\\n2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole displays a maximum CO2 molar absorption capacity of 1.0 mol·mol−1\\nand the absorbed CO2 can be completely released through heating the solution at a relatively low\\ntemperature (<100 ◦C). Stability tests show that the aqueous system is quite stable, with less than 10%\\nloss of the molar absorption capacity after eight absorption–desorption cycles. Time-related in-situ\\nattenuated total reﬂection infrared absorption spectroscopy and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance\\nspectroscopy studies reveal that the intermediates are HCO3−and H2CO3 in the process of CO2\\nabsorption–desorption. These intermediates are easily decomposed, which are responsible for the low\\nCO2 desorption temperature and high desorption efﬁciency of the system. Moreover, the aqueous\\nsolution of 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole is able to separate and purify CO2 from ﬂue gas and even\\nambient air. Consequently, 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole is a promising low-cost CO2 absorbent for\\nindustrial implementation.\\nKeywords: CO2 capture; 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole; bicarbonate ion; absorption-desorption'"
