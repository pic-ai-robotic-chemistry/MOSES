###### Preface to the second edition

Students of chemistry are not hard-pressed to fi nd a text to support their learning in organic
chemistry through their years at university. The shelves of a university bookshop will usually
offer a choice of at least half a dozen—all entitled ‘Organic Chemistry’, all with substantially
more than 1000 pages. Closer inspection of these titles quickly disappoints expectations of
variety. Almost without exception, general organic chemistry texts have been written to
accompany traditional American sophomore courses, with their rather precisely defi ned
requirements. This has left the authors of these books little scope for reinvigorating their
presentation of chemistry with new ideas.
We wanted to write a book whose structure grows from the development of ideas rather
than being dictated by the sequential presentation of facts. We believe that students benefi t
most of all from a book which leads from familiar concepts to unfamiliar ones, not just
encouraging them to know but to understand and to understand why. We were spurred on by
the nature of the best modern university chemistry courses, which themselves follow this
pattern: this is after all how science itself develops. We also knew that if we did this we could,
from the start, relate the chemistry we were talking about to the two most important sorts of
chemistry that exist—the chemistry that is known as life, and the chemistry as practised by
chemists solving real problems in laboratories.
We aimed at an approach which would make sense to and appeal to today’s students. But
all of this meant taking the axe to the roots of some long-standing textbook traditions. The
best way to fi nd out how something works is to take it apart and put it back together again,
so we started with the tools for expressing chemical ideas: structural diagrams and curly
arrows. Organic chemistry is too huge a fi eld to learn even a small part by rote, but with these
tools, students can soon make sense of chemistry which may be unfamiliar in detail by relating it to what they know and understand. By calling on curly arrows and ordering chemistry
according to mechanism we allow ourselves to discuss mechanistically (and orbitally) simple
reactions (addition to C=O, for example) before more complex and involved ones (such as
SN1 and SN2).
Complexity follows in its own time, but we have deliberately omitted detailed discussion of
obscure reactions of little value, or of variants of reactions which lie a simple step of mechanistic logic from our main story: some of these are explored in the problems associated with
each chapter, which are available online.[1] We have similarly aimed to avoid exhuming principles and rules (from those of Le Châtelier through Markovnikov, Saytseff, least motion, and
the like) to explain things which are better understood in terms of unifying fundamental
thermodynamic or mechanistic concepts.
All science must be underpinned by evidence, and support for organic chemistry’s claims is
provided by spectroscopy. For this reason we fi rst reveal to students the facts which spectroscopy tells us (Chapter 3) before trying to explain them (Chapter 4) and then use them to
deduce mechanisms (Chapter 5). NMR in particular forms a signifi cant part of four chapters
in the book, and evidence drawn from NMR underpins many of the discussions right through
the book. Likewise, the mechanistic principles we outline in Chapter 5, fi rmly based in the
orbital theories of Chapter 4, underpin all of the discussion of new reactions through the rest
of the book.
We have presented chemistry as something whose essence is truth, of provable veracity, but
which is embellished with opinions and suggestions to which not all chemists subscribe. We
aim to avoid dogma and promote the healthy weighing up of evidence, and on occasion we
are content to leave readers to draw their own conclusions. Science is important not just to
scientists, but to society. Our aim has been to write a book which itself takes a scientifi c

standpoint—‘one foot inside the boundary of the known, the other just outside’[2]—and
encourages the reader to do the same.
The authors are indebted to the many supportive and critical readers of the fi rst edition of
this book who have supplied us over the last ten years with a stream of comments and corrections, hearty encouragements and stern rebukes. All were carefully noted and none was overlooked while we were writing this edition. In many cases these contributions helped us to
correct errors or make other improvements to the text. We would also like to acknowledge the
support and guidance of the editorial team at OUP, and again to recognize the seminal contribution of the man who fi rst nurtured the vision that organic chemistry could be taught
with a book like this, Michael Rodgers. The time spent on the preparation of this edition was
made available only with the forbearance of our families, friends and research groups, and we
thank all of them for their patience and understanding.

###### Changes for this edition

In the decade since the publication of the fi rst edition of this book it has become clear that
some aspects of our original approach were in need of revision, some chapters in need of
updating with material which has gained in signifi cance over those years, and others in need
of shortening. We have taken into account a consistent criticism from readers that the early
chapters of the fi rst edition were too detailed for new students, and have made substantial
changes to the material in Chapters 4, 8, and 12, shifting the emphasis towards explanation
and away from detail more suitably found in specialised texts. Every chapter has been rewritten to improve clarity and new explanations and examples have been used widely. The style,
location, and content of the spectroscopy chapters (3, 13, 18, and 31) have been revised to
strengthen the links with material appearing nearby in the book. Concepts such as conjugate
addition and regioselectivity, which previously lacked coherent presentation, now have their
own chapters (22 and 24). In some sections of the fi rst edition, groups of chapters were used
to present related material: these chapter groups have now been condensed—so, for example,
Chapters 25 and 26 on enolate chemistry replace four previous chapters, Chapters 31 and 32
on cyclic molecules replace three chapters, Chapter 36 on rearrangements and fragmentations replaces two chapters, and Chapter 42 on the organic chemistry of life replaces three
chapters (the former versions of which are available online). Three chapters placed late in the
fi rst edition have been moved forward and revised to emphasize links between their material
and the enolate chemistry of Chapters 25 and 26, thus Chapter 27 deals with double-bond
stereocontrol in the context of organo-main group chemistry, and Chapters 29 and 30,
addressing aromatic heterocycles, now reinforce the link between many of the mechanisms
characteristic of these compounds and those of the carbonyl addition and condensation reactions discussed in the previous chapters. Earlier discussion of heterocycles also allows a theme
of cyclic molecules and transition states to develop throughout Chapters 29–36, and matches
more closely the typical order of material in undergraduate courses.
Some fi elds have inevitably advanced considerably in the last 10 years: the chapters on
organometallic chemistry (40) and asymmetric synthesis (41) have received the most extensive revision, and are now placed consecutively to allow the essential role of organometallic
catalysis in asymmetric synthesis to come to the fore. Throughout the book, new examples,
especially from the recent literature of drug synthesis, have been used to illustrate the reactions being discussed.

###### Organic chemistry and this book

You can tell from the title that this book tells you about organic chemistry. But it tells you
more than that: it tells you how we know about organic chemistry. It tells you facts, but it also
teaches you how to fi nd facts out. It tells you about reactions, and teaches you how to predict
which reactions will work; it tells you about molecules, and it teaches you how to work out
ways of making them.
We said ‘it tells’ in that last paragraph. Maybe we should have said ‘we tell’ because we want
to speak to you through our words so that you can see how we think about organic chemistry
and to encourage you to develop your own ideas. We expect you to notice that three people
have written this book, and that they don’t all think or write in the same way. That is as it
should be. Organic chemistry is too big and important a subject to be restricted by dogmatic
rules. Different chemists think in different ways about many aspects of organic chemistry
and in many cases it is not yet, and may never be, possible to be sure who is right. In many
cases it doesn’t matter anyway.
We may refer to the history of chemistry from time to time but we are usually going to tell
you about organic chemistry as it is now. We will develop the ideas slowly, from simple and
fundamental ones using small molecules to complex ideas and large molecules. We promise
one thing. We are not going to pull the wool over your eyes by making things artifi cially simple and avoiding the awkward questions. We aim to be honest and share both our delight in
good complete explanations and our puzzlement at inadequate ones.

###### The chapters

So how are we going to do this? The book starts with a series of chapters on the structures and
reactions of simple molecules. You will meet the way structures are determined and the theory that explains those structures. It is vital that you realize that theory is used to explain
what is known by experiment and only then to predict what is unknown. You will meet
mechanisms—the dynamic language used by chemists to talk about reactions—and of course
some reactions.
The book starts with an introductory section of four chapters:

**1.** What is organic chemistry?

**2.** Organic structures

**3.** Determining organic structures

**4.** Structure of molecules

Chapter 1 is a ‘rough guide’ to the subject—it will introduce the major areas where organic
chemistry plays a role, and set the scene by showing you some snapshots of a few landmarks.
In Chapter 2 you will look at the way in which we present diagrams of molecules on the
printed page. Organic chemistry is a visual, three-dimensional subject and the way you draw
molecules shows how you think about them. We want you too to draw molecules in the best
way possible. It is just as easy to draw them well as to draw them in an old-fashioned or inaccurate way.
Then in Chapter 3, before we come to the theory which explains molecular structure, we
shall introduce you to the experimental techniques which tell us about molecular structure.
This means studying the interactions between molecules and radiation by spectroscopy—
using the whole electromagnetic spectrum from X-rays to radio waves. Only then, in Chapter
4, will we go behind the scenes and look at the theories of why atoms combine in the ways
they do. Experiment comes before explanation. The spectroscopic methods of Chapter 3 will
still be telling the truth in a hundred years’ time, but the theories of Chapter 4 will look quite
dated by then.


-----

We could have titled those three chapters:

**2.** What shapes do organic molecules have?

**3.** How do we know they have those shapes?

**4.** Why do they have those shapes?

You need to have a grasp of the answers to these three questions before you start the study
of organic reactions. That is exactly what happens next. We introduce organic reaction mechanisms in Chapter 5. Any kind of chemistry studies reactions—the transformations of molecules into other molecules. The dynamic process by which this happens is called mechanism
and is the grammar of organic chemistry—the way that one molecule can change into
another. We want you to start learning and using this language straight away so in Chapter 6
we apply it to one important class of reaction. We therefore have:

**5.** Organic reactions

**6.** Nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group

Chapter 6 reveals how we are going to subdivide organic chemistry. We shall use a mechanistic classifi cation rather than a structural classifi cation and explain one type of reaction rather
than one type of compound in each chapter. In the rest of the book most of the chapters describe
types of reaction in a mechanistic way. Here is a selection from the fi rst half of the book:

**9.** Using organometallic reagents to make C–C bonds

**10.** Nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group

**11.** Nucleophilic substitution at C=O with loss of carbonyl oxygen

**15.** Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon

**17.** Elimination reactions

**19.** Electrophilic addition to alkenes

**20.** Formation and reactions of enols and enolates

**21.** Electrophilic aromatic substitution

**22.** Conjugate addition and nucleophilic aromatic substitution

Interspersed with these chapters are others on physical aspects of molecular structure and
reactivity, stereochemistry, and structural determination, which allow us to show you how we
know what we are telling you is true and to explain reactions intelligently.

**7.** Delocalization and conjugation

**8.** Acidity, basicity, and pKa

**12.** Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms

**13.** [1]H NMR: proton nuclear magnetic resonance

**14.** Stereochemistry

**16.** Conformational analysis

**18.** Review of spectroscopic methods

By the time we reach the end of Chapter 22 you will have met most of the important ways
in which organic molecules react with one another, and we will then spend two chapters
revisiting some of the reactions you have met before in two chapters on selectivity: how to get
the reaction you want to happen and avoid the reaction you don’t.

**23.** Chemoselectivity and protecting groups

**24.** Regioselectivity

The materials are now in place for us to show you how to make use of the reaction mechanisms you have seen. We spend four chapters explaining some ways of using carbonyl chemistry and the chemistry of Si, S, and P to make C–C and C=C bonds. We then bring this all
together with a chapter which gives you the tools to work out how you might best set about
making any particular molecule.


-----

**25.** Alkylation of enolates

**26.** Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds: the aldol and Claisen reactions

**27.** Sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry

**28.** Retrosynthetic analysis

Most organic compounds contain rings, and many cyclic structures entail one of two
aspects which are rather special: aromaticity and well-defi ned conformations. The next group
of chapters leads you through the chemistry of ring-containing compounds to the point
where we have the tools to explain why even acyclic molecules react to give products with
certain spatial features.

**29.** Aromatic heterocycles 1: reactions

**30.** Aromatic heterocycles 2: synthesis

**31.** Saturated heterocycles and stereoelectronics

**32.** Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules

**33.** Diasteroselectivity

We said that Chapter 22 marks the point where most of the important ways in which molecules react together have been introduced—most but not all. For the next section of the book we
survey a range of rather less common but extremely important alternative mechanisms, fi nishing with a chapter that tells you how we can fi nd out what mechanism a reaction follows.

**34.** Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions

**35.** Pericyclic reactions 2: sigmatropic and electrocyclic reactions

**36.** Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation

**37.** Radical reactions

**38.** Synthesis and reactions of carbenes

**39.** Determining reaction mechanisms

The last few chapters of the book take you right into some of the most challenging roles that
organic chemistry has been called on to play, and in many cases tell you about chemistry
discovered only in the last few years. The reactions in these chapters have been used to make
the most complex molecules ever synthesized, and to illuminate the way that organic chemistry underpins life itself.

**40.** Organometallic chemistry

**41.** Asymmetric synthesis

**42.** Organic chemistry of life

**43.** Organic chemistry today

###### ‘Connections’ sections

That’s a linear list of 43 chapters, but chemistry is not a linear subject! It is impossible to work
through the whole fi eld of organic chemistry simply by starting at the beginning and working
through to the end, introducing one new topic at a time, because chemistry is a network of
interconnecting ideas. But, unfortunately, a book is, by nature, a beginning-to-end sort of
thing. We have arranged the chapters in a progression of diffi culty as far as is possible, but to
help you fi nd your way around we have included at the beginning of each chapter a
‘Connections’ section. This tells you three things divided among three columns:

**(a)** The ‘Building on’ column: what you should be familiar with before reading the
chapter—in other words, which previous chapters relate directly to the material
within the chapter.

**(b)** The ‘Arriving at’ column: a guide to what you will fi nd within the chapter.

**(c)** The ‘Looking forward to’ column: signposting which chapters later in the book fi ll out
and expand the material in the chapter.


-----

This sort of margin note will
mainly contain cross-references to
other parts of the book as a further
aid to navigation. You will fi nd an
example on p. 10.


The fi rst time you read a chapter, you should really make sure you have read any chapter
mentioned under (a). When you become more familiar with the book you will fi nd
that the links highlighted in (a) and (c) will help you see how chemistry interconnects
with itself.

###### Boxes and margin notes

The other things you should look out for throughout the text are the margin notes and boxes.
There are four sorts:



- Sometimes the main text of
the book needs clarifi cation or
expansion, and this sort of
margin note will contain such
little extras to help you
understand diffi cult points. It
will also remind you of things
from elsewhere in the book that
illuminate what is being
discussed. You would do well to
read these notes the fi rst time
you read the chapter, although
you might choose to skip them
later as the ideas become more
familiar.


###### Online support

Organic structures and organic reactions are three-dimensional (3D), and as a complement to
the necessarily two-dimensional representations in this book we have developed a comprehensive online resource to allow you to appreciate the material in three dimensions.
ChemTube3D contains interactive 3D animations and structures, with supporting information, for some of the most important topics in organic chemistry, to help you master the
concepts presented in this book. Online resources are fl agged on the pages to which they
relate by an icon in the margin. Each web page contains some information about the reaction
and an intuitive interactive reaction scheme that controls the display. 3D curly arrows indicate the reaction mechanism, and the entire sequence from starting materials via transition
state to products is displayed with animated bond-breaking and forming, and animated
charges and lone pairs. The entire process is under the control of you, the user, and can be
viewed in three dimensions from any angle. The resizable window button produces a larger
window with a range of control options and the molecular photo booth allows you to make a
permanent record of the view you want.
ChemTube3D uses Jmol to display the animations so users can interact with the animated
3D structures using the pop-up menu or console using only a web browser. It is ideal for personalized learning and open-ended investigation is possible. We suggest that you make use of
the interactive resources once you have read the relevant section of the book to consolidate
your understanding of chemistry and enhance your appreciation of the importance of spatial
arrangements.
Substantial modifi cations were made in the writing of this new edition, including the loss or
contraction of four chapters found towards the end of the fi rst edition. To preserve this material for future use, the following four chapters from the fi rst edition are available for download
from the book’s website at www.oxfordtextbooks.co.uk/orc/clayden2e/:

 - The chemistry of life

 - Mechanisms in biological chemistry

 - Natural products

 - Polymerization



- **The most important box looks like this. Anything in this sort of box is a key concept or a**
**summary. It’s the sort of thing you would do well to hold in your mind as you read or to note**
**down as you learn.**


Boxes like this will contain additional examples, amusing background information, and similar interesting, but maybe
inessential, material. The fi rst time you read a chapter, you might want to miss out this sort of box, and only read them
later on to fl esh out some of the main themes of the chapter.

###### Further reading

At the end of each chapter, you may fi nd yourself wanting to know more about the material it
covers. We have given a collection of suggested places to look for this material—other books,
or reviews in the chemical literature, or even some original research papers. There are thousands of examples in this book, and in most cases we have not directed you to the reports of
the original work—this can usually be found by a simple electronic database search. Instead,
we have picked out publications which seem most interesting, or relevant. If you want an
encyclopaedia of organic chemistry, this is not the book for you. You would be better turning
to one such as March’s Advanced Organic Chemistry (M. B. Smith and J. March, 6th edn, Wiley,
2007), which contains thousands of references.

###### Problems

You can’t learn all of organic chemistry—there’s just too much of it. You can learn trivial
things like the names of compounds but that doesn’t help you understand the principles
behind the subject. You have to _understand the principles because the only way to tackle_
organic chemistry is to learn to work it out. That is why we have provided problems, which
you can access from the book’s web site. They are to help you discover if you have understood
the material presented in each chapter.
If a chapter is about a certain type of organic reaction, say elimination reactions (Chapter
19), the chapter itself will describe the various ways (‘mechanisms’) by which the reaction
can occur and it will give defi nitive examples of each mechanism. In Chapter 19 there are
three mechanisms and about 60 examples altogether. You might think that this is rather a
lot but there are in fact millions of examples known of these three mechanisms and
Chapter 19 barely scrapes the surface. The problems will help you make sure that your
understanding is sound, and that it will stand up to exposure to the rigours of explaining
real-life chemistry.
In general, the 10–15 problems at the end of each chapter start easy and get more diffi cult. They come in two or three sorts. The fi rst, generally shorter and easier, allow you to
revise the material in that chapter. They might revisit examples from the chapter to check
that you can use the ideas in familiar situations. The next few problems might develop
specifi c ideas from different parts of the chapter, asking you, for example, why one compound reacts in one way while a similar one behaves quite differently. Finally, you will fi nd
some more challenging problems asking you to extend the ideas to unfamiliar molecules,
and, especially later in the book, to situations which draw on the material from more than
one chapter.
The end-of-chapter problems should set you on your way but they are not the end of the
journey to understanding. You are probably reading this text as part of a university course and
you should fi nd out what kind of examination problems your university uses and practise
them too. Your tutor will be able to advise you on suitable problems to help you at each stage
of your development.

###### The solutions manual

The problems would be of little use to you if you could not check your answers. For maximum
benefi t, you need to tackle some or all of the problems as soon as you have fi nished each chapter without looking at the answers. Then you need to compare your suggestions with ours.
You will fi nd our suggestions in the accompanying solutions manual, where each problem is
discussed in some detail. (You can buy the solutions manual separately from this book.) The
purpose of the problem is fi rst stated or explained. Then, if the problem is a simple one, the
answer is given. If the problem is more complex, a discussion of possible answers follows with
some comments on the value of each. There may be a reference to the source of the problem
so that you can read further if you wish.

###### Colour

If you have fl icked forward through the pages of this book, you will already have noticed
something unusual: almost all of the chemical structures are shown in red. This is quite
intentional: emphatic red underlines the message that structures are more important than
words in organic chemistry. But sometimes small parts of structures are in other colours: here
are two examples from p. 12, where we talk about organic compounds containing elements
other than C and H.

**O**

**I**

**N**

**O**

**HO**

**O**


**Cl**

**Br**


**F**
**HO**

Why are the atom labels black? Because we wanted them to stand out from the rest of the
molecule. In general you will see black used to highlight the important details of a molecule—
they may be the groups taking part in a reaction, or something that has changed as a result of
the reaction, as in these examples from Chapters 9 and 17.


**O** **HO** **Ph**

We shall often use black to emphasize ‘curly arrows’, devices that show the movement of
electrons, and whose use you will learn about in Chapter 5. Here are examples from Chapters
11 and 22: notice black also helps the ‘ + ’ and ‘–’ charges to stand out.

Occasionally, we shall use other colours, such as green, orange, or brown, to highlight
points of secondary importance. This example is part of a reaction taken from Chapter 19: we
want to show that a molecule of water (H2O) is formed. The green atoms show where the water
comes from. Notice black curly arrows and a new black bond.

Other colours come in when things get more complicated—in this Chapter 21 example, we
want to show two possible outcomes of a reaction: the brown and the orange arrows show the
two alternatives, with the green highlighting the deuterium atom remaining in both cases.

four different groups and those with only three different groups. The message is: if you see

###### What is organic chemistry?
## 1

###### Organic chemistry and you


You are already a highly skilled organic chemist. As you read these words, your eyes are
using an organic compound (retinal) to convert visible light into nerve impulses. When
you picked up this book, your muscles were doing chemical reactions on sugars to give
you the energy you needed. As you understand, gaps between your brain cells are being
bridged by simple organic molecules (neurotransmitter amines) so that nerve impulses
can be passed around your brain. And you did all that without consciously thinking
about it. You do not yet understand these processes in your mind as well as you can
carry them out in your brain and body. You are not alone there. No organic chemist,
however brilliant, understands the detailed chemical working of the human mind or
body very well.
We, the authors, include ourselves in this generalization, but we are going to show you
in this book what enormous strides have been taken in the understanding of organic
chemistry since the science came into being in the early years of the nineteenth century.
Organic chemistry began as a tentative attempt to understand the chemistry of life. It has
grown into the confi dent basis of worldwide activities that feed, clothe, and cure millions
of people without their even being aware of the role of chemistry in their lives. Chemists
co operate with physicists and mathematicians to understand how molecules behave and
with biologists to understand how interactions between molecules underlie all of life. The
enlightenment brought by chemistry in the twentieth century amounted to a revolution
in our understanding of the molecular world, but in these fi rst decades of the twenty-fi rst
century the revolution is still far from complete. We aim not to give you the measurements of the skeleton of a dead science but to equip you to understand the confl icting
demands of an adolescent one.
Like all sciences, chemistry has a unique place in our pattern of understanding of the
universe. It is the science of molecules. But organic chemistry is something more. It literally creates itself as it grows. Of course we need to study the molecules of nature both
because they are interesting in their own right and because their functions are important
to our lives. Organic chemistry has always been able to illuminate the mechanisms of life
by making new molecules that give information not available from the molecules actually present in living things.
This creation of new molecules has given us new materials such as plastics to make things
with, new dyes to colour our clothes, new perfumes to wear, new drugs to cure diseases. Some
people think some of these activities are unnatural and their products dangerous or unwholesome. But these new molecules are built by humans from other molecules found naturally on
earth using the skills inherent in our natural brains. Birds build nests; people build houses.
Which is unnatural? To the organic chemist this is a meaningless distinction. There are toxic
compounds and nutritious ones, stable compounds and reactive ones—but there is only one
type of chemistry: it goes on both inside our brains and bodies, and also in our fl asks and
reactors, born from the ideas in our minds and the skill in our hands. We are not going to set
ourselves up as moral judges in any way. We believe it is right to try and understand the world

###### Organic compounds

Organic chemistry started as the chemistry of life, when that was thought to be different from
the chemistry in the laboratory. Then it became the chemistry of carbon compounds, especially those found in coal. But now it is both. It is the chemistry of the compounds formed by
carbon and other elements such as are found in living things, in the products of living things,
and wherever else carbon is found.
The most abundant organic compounds are those present in living things and those formed
over millions of years from dead things. In earlier times, the organic compounds known from
nature were those in the ‘essential oils’ that could be distilled from plants and the alkaloids
that could be extracted from crushed plants with acid. Menthol is a famous example of a
fl avouring compound from the essential oil of spearmint and cis-jasmone an example of a
perfume distilled from jasmine fl owers.
Natural products have long been used to cure diseases, and in the sixteenth century one
became famous—quinine was extracted from the bark of the South American cinchona tree
and used to treat fevers, especially malaria. The Jesuits who did this work (the remedy was
known as ‘Jesuit’s bark’) did not of course know what the structure of quinine was, but now
we do. More than that, the molecular structure of quinine has inspired the design of modern
drug molecules which treat malaria much more effectively than quinine itself.
The main reservoir of chemicals available to the nineteenth century chemists was coal.
Distillation of coal to give gas for lighting and heating (mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide) also gave a brown tar rich in aromatic compounds such as benzene, pyridine, phenol,
aniline, and thiophene.

Perkin was studying in London
with the great German chemist,
Hofmann. Perkin’s attempt to
make quinine this way was a
remarkable practical challenge
given that its structure was still
unknown.


Phenol was used in the nineteenth century by Lister as an antiseptic in surgery, and aniline
became the basis for the dyestuffs industry. It was this that really started the search for new
organic compounds made by chemists rather than by nature. In 1856, while trying to make
quinine from aniline, an 18-year old British chemist, William Perkin, managed to produce a
mauve residue, mauveine, which revolutionized the dyeing of cloth and gave birth to the
synthetic dyestuffs industry. A related dyestuff of this kind—still available—is Bismarck
Brown: much of the early work on dyes was done in Germany.

In the twentieth century oil overtook coal as the main source of bulk organic compounds
so that simple hydrocarbons like methane (CH4, ‘natural gas’), propane, and butane
(CH3CH2CH3 and CH3CH2CH2CH3, ‘calor gas’ or LPG) became available for fuel. At the
same time chemists began the search for new molecules from new sources such as fungi,
corals, and bacteria, and two organic chemical industries developed in parallel—’bulk’ and


-----

‘fi ne’ chemicals. Bulk chemicals like paints and plastics are usually based on simple molecules
produced in multitonne quantities while fi ne chemicals such as drugs, perfumes, and fl avouring materials are produced in smaller quantities but much more profi tably.
At the time of writing there were over 16 million organic compounds known. How many
more might there be? Even counting only moderately sized molecules, containing fewer than
about 30 carbon atoms (about the size of the mauveine structure above), it has been calculated
that something in the region of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10[63]) stable compounds are possible. There aren’t enough
carbon atoms in the universe to make them all.
Among the 16 million that have been made, there are all kinds of molecules with amazingly
varied properties. What do they look like? They may be crystalline solids, oils, waxes, plastics,
elastics, mobile or volatile liquids, or gases. Familiar ones include sugar, a cheap natural compound isolated from plants as hard white crystals when pure, and petrol, a mixture of colourless, volatile, fl ammable hydrocarbons. Isooctane is a typical example and gives its name to
the octane rating of petrol.

Colour is not the only characteristic by which we recognize compounds. All too often it is
their odour that lets us know they are around. There are some quite foul organic compounds
too; the infamous stench of the skunk is a mixture of two thiols—sulfur compounds containing SH groups.
But perhaps the worst smell ever recorded was that which caused the evacuation of the
German city of Freiburg in 1889. Attempts to make thioacetone by the cracking of trithioacetone gave rise to ‘an offensive smell which spread rapidly over a great area of the town causing fainting, vomiting, and a panic evacuation...the laboratory work was abandoned’.
It was perhaps foolhardy for workers at an Esso research station to repeat the experiment of
cracking trithioacetone south of Oxford in 1967. Let them take up the story. ‘Recently we
found ourselves with an odour problem beyond our worst expectations. During early experiments, a stopper jumped from a bottle of residues, and, although replaced at once, resulted in
an immediate complaint of nausea and sickness from colleagues working in a building two
hundred yards away. Two of our chemists who had done no more than investigate the cracking of minute amounts of trithioacetone found themselves the object of hostile stares in a
restaurant and suffered the humiliation of having a waitress spray the area around them with
a deodorant. The odours defi ed the expected effects of dilution since workers in the laboratory
did not fi nd the odours intolerable ... and genuinely denied responsibility since they were
working in closed systems. To convince them otherwise, they were dispersed with other
observers around the laboratory, at distances up to a quarter of a mile, and one drop of either
acetone _gem-dithiol or the mother liquors from crude trithioacetone crystallizations were_
placed on a watch glass in a fume cupboard. The odour was detected downwind in seconds.’
There are two candidates for this dreadful smell—propane dithiol (called acetone gemdithiol above) or 4-methyl-4-sulfanylpentan-2-one. It is unlikely that anyone else will be
brave enough to resolve the controversy.
But nasty smells have their uses. The natural gas piped into homes contains small amounts
of deliberately added sulfur compounds such as tert-butyl thiol (CH3)3CSH. When we say small,
we mean very small—humans can detect one part in 50,000,000,000 parts of natural gas.
Other compounds have delightful odours. To redeem the honour of sulfur compounds we
must cite the truffl e, which pigs can smell through a metre of soil and whose taste and smell
is so delightful that truffl es cost more than their weight in gold. Damascenones are responsible for the smell of roses. If you smell one drop you will be disappointed, as it smells rather like
turpentine or camphor, but next morning you, and the clothes you were wearing, will smell
powerfully of roses. Many smells develop on dilution.
Humans are not the only creatures with a sense of smell. We can fi nd mates using all our
senses, but insects cannot do this. They are small in a crowded world and they fi nd those of
the opposite sex of their own species by smell. Most insects produce volatile compounds that
can be picked up by a potential mate in incredibly weak concentrations. Only 1.5 mg of serricornin, the sex pheromone of the cigarette beetle, could be isolated from 65,000 female
beetles—so there isn’t much in each beetle. Nevertheless, the slightest whiff of it causes the
males to gather and attempt frenzied copulation. The sex pheromone of the beetle Popilia
_japonica, also given off by the females, has been made by chemists. As little as 5 μg (micro-_
grams, note!) was more effective than four virgin females in attracting the males.

The pheromone of the gypsy moth, disparlure, was identifi ed from a few μg isolated from
the moths: as little as 2 × 10[−][12] g is active as a lure for the males in fi eld tests. The three pheromones we have mentioned are available commercially for the specifi c trapping of these
destructive insect pests.

Don’t suppose that the females always do all the work; both male and female olive fl ies produce pheromones that attract the other sex. The remarkable thing is that one mirror image of
the molecule attracts the males while the other attracts the females! Mirror image isomers of
a molecule called frontalin are also emitted by male elephants; female elephants can tell the
age and appeal of a potential mate from the amount of each isomer he produces.

What about taste? Take the grapefruit. The main fl avour comes from another sulfur compound and human beings can detect 2 × 10[−][5] parts per billion of this compound. This is an
almost unimaginably small amount equal to 10[−][4] mg per tonne or a drop, not in a bucket, but
in a fairly large lake. Why evolution should have left us so extraordinarily sensitive to grapefruit, we leave you to imagine.
For a nasty taste, we should mention ‘bittering agents’, put into dangerous household substances like toilet cleaner to stop children drinking them by accident. Notice that this complex organic compound is actually a salt—it has positively charged nitrogen and negatively
charged oxygen atoms—and this makes it soluble in water.

Again, let’s not forget other creatures. Cats seem to be able to go to sleep anywhere, at any
time. This surprisingly simple compound, isolated from the cerebrospinal fl uid of cats, appears
to be part of their sleep-control mechanism. It makes them, or rats, or humans fall asleep
immediately.

This compound and disparlure (above) are both derivatives of fatty acids. Fatty acids in the
diet are a popular preoccupation, and the good and bad qualities of saturates, monounsaturates, and polyunsaturates are continually in the news: one of the many dietary molecules
reckoned to have demonstrable anticancer activity is CLA (conjugated linoleic acid), which is
found in dairy products and also, most abundantly, you may be interested to know, in kangaroo meat.
Resveratrole is another dietary component with benefi cial effects: it may be responsible for
the apparent ability of red wine to prevent heart disease. It is a quite different sort of organic
compound, with two benzene rings.
For a third edible molecule, how about vitamin C? This is an essential factor in your diet—
that is why it is called a vitamin—and in the diet of other primates, guinea-pigs, and fruit bats
(other mammals possess the biochemical machinery to make it themselves). The disease
scurvy, a degeneration of soft tissues from which sailors on the long voyages of past centuries
suffered, results from a lack of vitamin C. It also is a universal antioxidant, scavenging for
rogue reactive radicals and protecting damage to DNA. Some people think an extra large
intake may even protect against the common cold.

###### Organic chemistry and industry

Vitamin C is manufactured on a huge scale by Roche, a Swiss company. All over the world
there are chemistry-based companies making organic molecules on scales varying from a few
kilograms to thousands of tonnes per year. This is good news for students of organic chemistry: knowing how molecules behave and how to make them is a skill in demand, and it is an
international job market.
The petrochemicals industry consumes huge amounts of crude oil: the largest refi nery in
the world, in Jamnagar, India, processes 200 million litres of crude oil every day. An alarmingly large proportion of this is still just burnt as fuel, but some of it is purifi ed or converted
into organic compounds for use in the rest of the chemical industry.
Some simple compounds are made both from oil and from plants. The ethanol used as a
starting material to make other compounds in industry is largely made by the catalytic hydration of ethylene from oil. But ethanol is also used as a fuel, particularly in Brazil, where it is
made by fermentation of sugar cane. Plants are extremely powerful organic chemical factories
(with sugar cane being among the most effi cient of all of them). Photosynthesis extracts carbon dioxide directly from the air and uses solar energy to reduce it to form less oxygen-rich
organic compounds from which energy can be re-extracted by combustion. Biodiesel is made
in a similar way from the fatty acid components of plant oils.

Plastics and polymers take much of the production of the petrochemical industry in the
form of monomers such as styrene, acrylates, and vinyl chloride. The products of this enormous industry are everything made of plastic, including solid plastics for household goods
and furniture, fi bres for clothes (over 25 million tonnes per annum), elastic polymers for car
tyres, light bubble-fi lled polymers for packing, and so on. Worldwide 100 million tonnes of
polymers are made per year and PVC manufacture alone employs over 50,000 people to make
over 20 million tones per year.
Many adhesives work by polymerization of monomers, which can be applied as a simple
solution. You can glue almost anything with ‘superglue’, a polymer of methyl cyanoacrylate.
Washing-up bowls are made of the polymer polyethylene but the detergent you put in them
belongs to another branch of the chemical industry—companies like Unilever and Procter
and Gamble produce detergent, cleaners, bleaches, and polishes, along with soaps, gels, cosmetics, and shaving foams. These products may smell of lemon, lavender, or sandalwood but
they too mostly come from the oil industry.
Products of this kind tend to underplay their petrochemical origins and claim affi nity with
the perceived freshness and cleanliness of the natural world. They also try to tell us, after a


-----

fashion, what they contain. Try this example—the list of contents from a well-known brand
of shower gel, which we are reassuringly told is ‘packed with natural stuff’ (including 10 ‘real’
lemons) and contains ‘100% pure and natural lemon and tea tree essential oils’.
It doesn’t all make sense to us, but here is a possible interpretation. We certainly hope this
book will set you on the path of understanding the sense (and the nonsense!) of this sort
of thing.

The particular detergents, surfactants, acids, viscosity controllers, and so on are chosen to
blend together to give a smooth gel. The result should feel, smell, and look attractive and work
as an effective detergent and shampoo (some of the compounds are added for their moisturizing and anti-electrostatic effect on hair). The yellow colour and lemon scent are considered
fresh and clean by the customer. Several of the ingredients are added as pure compounds; the
ones which aren’t are mixtures of isomers or polymers; the most impure are the mixtures of
hydrocarbons referred to as the ‘pure and natural’ essential oils. Is it ‘packed with natural
stuff’? Indeed it is. It all comes from natural sources, the principal one being decomposed
carboniferous forests trapped for millions of years underground.
The coloration of manufactured goods is a huge business, with a range of intense colours
required for dyeing cloth, colouring plastic and paper, painting walls, and so on. Leaders in
this area are companies such as Akzo Nobel, which had sales of €14.6 bn in 2010. One of the
most commonly used dyestuffs is indigo, an ancient dye that used to be isolated from plants
but is now made from petrochemical feedstocks. It is the colour of blue jeans. More modern

dyestuffs can be represented by the benzodifuranones developed by ICI, which are used for
colouring synthetic fabrics like polyesters (red), the phthalocyanine–metal complexes (typically blue or green), or the ‘high-performance’ red pigment DPP (1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrroles) series developed by Ciba-Geigy.

The scent of the shower gel above came from a mixture of plant extracts with the pure compound (in fact a mixture of two isomers) citral. The big fragrance and fl avouring companies
(such as Firmenich, International Flavors and Fragrances, and Givaudan) deal in both naturals and synthetics—‘naturals’ are mixtures of compounds extracted from plants—leaves,
seeds, and fl owers. ‘Synthetics’ are single compounds, sometimes present in plant-derived
sources and sometime newly designed molecules, which are mixed with each other and with
‘naturals’ to build up a scent. A typical perfume will contain 5–10% fragrance molecules in an
ethanol/water (about 90:10) mixture. So the perfumery industry needs a very large amount of
ethanol and, you might think, not much perfumery material. In fact, important fragrances
like jasmine are produced on a >10,000 tonnes per annum scale. The cost of a pure perfume
ingredient like cis-jasmone (p. 2), the main ingredient of jasmine, may be several hundred
pounds, dollars, or euros per gram.


###### The world of perfumery

Perfume chemists use extraordinary language to describe their achievements: ‘PacoRabanne pour homme was created
to reproduce the effect of a summer walk in the open air among the hills of Provence: the smell of herbs, rosemary and
thyme, and sparkling freshness with cool sea breezes mingling with warm soft Alpine air. To achieve the required effect,
the perfumer blended herbaceous oils with woody accords and the synthetic aroma chemical dimethylheptanol, which
has a penetrating but indefi nable freshness associated with open air or freshly washed linen.’


Chemists produce synthetic fl avourings such as ‘smoky bacon’ and even ‘chocolate’. Meaty
fl avours come from simple heterocycles such as alkyl pyrazines (present in coffee as well as
roast meat) and furonol, originally found in pineapples. Compounds such as corylone and
maltol give caramel and meaty fl avours. Mixtures of these and other synthetic compounds
can be ‘tuned’ to taste like many roasted foods from fresh bread to coffee and barbecued meat.
Some fl avouring compounds are also perfumes and may also be used as an intermediate in
making other compounds. Vanillin is the main component of the fl avour of vanilla, but is
manufactured on a large scale for many other uses too.

Food chemistry includes much larger-scale items than fl avours. Sweeteners such as sugar
itself are isolated from plants on an enormous scale. You saw sucrose on p. 3, but other sweeteners such as saccharin (discovered in 1879!) and aspartame (1965) are made on a sizeable
scale. Aspartame is a compound of two of the natural amino acids present in all living things
and over 10,000 tonnes per annum are made by the NutraSweet company.

The story of Tamifl u and how
the ingenuity of chemists ensures a
constant supply is related at the
other end of this book, in
Chapter 43.


One of the great revolutions of modern life has been the expectation that humans will survive diseases because of a specifi cally designed treatment. In the developed world, people live
to old age because infections which used to kill can now be cured or kept at bay. Antibiotics are
our defence against bacteria, preventing them from multiplying. One of the most successful of
these is Beecham amoxycillin, which was developed by SmithKline. The four-membered ring
at the heart of the molecule is the β-lactam, which targets the diease-causing bacteria.
Medicinal chemists also protect us from the insidious threat of viruses which use the body’s
own biochemistry to replicate. Tamifl u is a line of defence against the ever-present danger of a
fl u epidemic, while ritonivir is one of the most advanced drugs designed to prevent replication
of HIV and to slow down or prevent the onset of AIDS.

The best-selling current drugs are largely designed to address the human body’s own failings. Sales of Lipitor and Nexium both topped $5bn in 2009, fi gures which serve to illustrate
the fi nancial scale of developing safe and effective new treatments. Lipitor is one of the class
of drugs known as statins, widely prescribed to control cholesterol levels in older people.
Nexium is a proton pump inhibitor, which works to reduce peptic and duodenal ulcers. Sales
of Glivec (developed by Novartis and introduced in 2001) are far smaller, but to those suffering from certain cancers such as leukaemia it can be a lifesaver.

We cannot maintain our present high density of population in the developed world, nor
deal with malnutrition in the developing world unless we preserve our food supply from
attacks by insects and fungi and from competition by weeds. The world market for agrochemicals produced by multinationals such as Bayer CropScience and Syngenta is over £10bn per
annum divided between herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides.
Many of the early agrochemicals were phased out as they were persistent environmental
pollutants. Modern agrochemicals have to pass stringent environmental safety tests. The
most famous modern insecticides are modelled on the plant-derived pyrethrins, stabilized
against degradation in sunlight by chemical modifi cation (the brown and green portions of
decamethrin) and targeted to specifi c insects on specifi c crops. Decamethrin has a safety factor of >10,000 for mustard beetles over mammals, can be applied at only 10 grams per hectare
(about one level tablespoon per football pitch), and leaves no signifi cant environmental
residue.

As you learn more chemistry, you will appreciate how remarkable it is that Nature should
produce the three-membered rings in these compounds and that chemists should use them
in bulk compounds to be sprayed on crops in fi elds. Even more remarkable in some ways are
the fungicides based on a fi ve-membered ring containing three nitrogen atoms—the triazole
ring. These compounds inhibit an enzyme present in fungi but not in plants or animals.
Fungal diseases are a real threat: as in the Irish potato famine of the nineteenth century, the
various fungal blights, blotches, rots, rusts, smuts, and mildews can overwhelm any crop in a
short time.

###### Organic chemistry and the periodic table

All the compounds we have shown you are built up on hydrocarbon (carbon and hydrogen)
skeletons. Most have oxygen and/or nitrogen as well; some have sulfur and some phosphorus, and maybe the halogens (F, Cl, Br, and I). These are the main elements of organic
chemistry.

But organic chemistry has also benefi tted from the exploration of (some would say takeover bid for) the rest of the periodic table. The organic chemistry of silicon, boron, lithium,
tin, copper, zinc, and palladium has been particularly well studied and these elements
are common constituents of ‘organic’ reagents used in the laboratory. You will meet many
of them throughout this book. Butyllithium, trimethylsilyl chloride, tributyltin hydride,
di e th ylzinc, and lithium dimethylcuprate provide examples.

The halogens also appear in many life-saving drugs. Antiviral compounds such as fi aluridine (which contains both F and I, as well as N and O) are essential for the fi ght against HIV
and AIDS. They are modelled on natural compounds from nucleic acids. The naturally occurring cytotoxic (antitumour) agent halomon, extracted from red algae, contains Br and Cl.
The organic chemist’s periodic table would have to emphasize all of these elements and
more—the table below highlights most of those elements in common use in organic reactions. New connections are being added all the time—before the end of the last century the
organic chemistry of ruthenium, gold, and samarium was negligible; now reagents and catalysts incorporating these metals drive a wide range of important reactions.

- You will certainly know
something about the periodic
table from your previous studies
of chemistry. A full Periodic Table
appears on pp. 1184–1185 of
this book, but basic knowledge
of the groups, which elements
are metals, and where the
elements shown in this table
appear will be helpful to you.

So where does inorganic chemistry end and organic chemistry begin? Would you say that
the antiviral compound foscarnet was organic? It is a compound of carbon with the formula
CPO5Na3 but it has no C–H bonds. And what about the important reagent tetrakis (triphenylphosphine)palladium? It has lots of hydrocarbon—12 benzene rings in fact—but the
benzene rings are all joined to phosphorus atoms that are arranged in a square around the
central palladium atom, so the molecule is held together by C–P and P–Pd bonds, not by a
hydrocarbon skeleton. Although it has the very organic-looking formula C72H60P4Pd, many
people would say it is inorganic. But is it?

The answer is that we don’t know and we don’t care. Strict boundaries between traditional
disciplines are undesirable and meaningless. Chemistry continues across the old boundaries
between organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry and physical chemistry or materials, or organic chemistry and biochemistry. Be glad that the boundaries are indistinct as that means the chemistry is all the richer. This lovely molecule (Ph3P)4Pd belongs to
_chemistry._

###### Organic chemistry and this book

We have told you about organic chemistry’s history, the types of compounds it concerns
itself with, the things it makes, and the elements it uses. Organic chemistry today is the
study of the structure and reactions of compounds in nature, of compounds in the fossil
reserves such as coal and oil, and of those compounds that can be made from them. These
compounds will usually be constructed with a hydrocarbon framework but will also often
have atoms such as O, N, S, P, Si, B, halogens, and metals attached to them. Organic chemistry is used in the making of plastics, paints, dyestuffs, clothes, foodstuffs, human and
veterinary medicines, agrochemicals, and many other things. Now we can summarize all of
these in a different way.



- **The main components of organic chemistry as a discipline are:**

**•** **structure determination—how to fi nd out the structures of new compounds even if they**
**are available only in invisibly small amounts**

**•** **theoretical organic chemistry—how to understand these structures in terms of atoms and**
**the electrons that bind them together**

**•** **reaction mechanisms—how to fi nd out how these molecules react with each other and**
**how to predict their reactions**

**•** **synthesis—how to design new molecules, and then make them**

**•** **biological chemistry—how to fi nd out what Nature does and how the structures of**
**biologically active molecules are related to what they do.**


This book is about all these things. It is about the structures of organic molecules and the reasons behind those structures. It is about the shapes of these molecules and how the shape relates
to their function, especially in the context of biology. It explains how these structures and shapes
are discovered. It tells you about the reactions the molecules undergo and, more importantly,
how and why they behave in the way they do. It tells you about nature and about industry. It tells
you how molecules are made and how you too can think about making molecules.
This is the landscape through which you are about to travel. And, as with any journey to
somewhere new, exciting, and sometimes challenging, the fi rst thing is to make sure you have
at least some knowledge of the local language. Fortunately the language of organic chemistry
couldn’t be simpler: it’s all pictures. The next chapter will get us communicating.

There are over 100 elements in the periodic table. Many molecules contain well over 100
atoms—palytoxin (a naturally occurring compound with potential anticancer activity), for
example, contains 129 carbon atoms, 221 hydrogen atoms, 54 oxygen atoms, and 3 nitrogen
atoms. It’s easy to see how chemical structures can display enormous variety, providing
enough molecules to build even the most complicated living creatures.

But how can we understand what seems like a recipe for confusion? Faced with the collection of atoms we call a molecule, how can we make sense of what we see? This chapter
will teach you how to interpret organic structures. It will also teach you how to draw
organic molecules in a way that conveys all the necessary information and none of the
superfl uous.

###### Hydrocarbon frameworks and functional groups

As we explained in Chapter 1, organic chemistry is the study of compounds that contain carbon. Nearly all organic compounds also contain hydrogen; most also contain oxygen, nitrogen, or other elements. Organic chemistry concerns itself with the way in which these atoms
are bonded together into stable molecular structures, and the way in which these structures
change in the course of chemical reactions.
Some molecular structures are shown below. These molecules are all amino acids, the constituents of proteins. Look at the number of carbon atoms in each molecule and the way they
are bonded together. Even within this small class of molecules there’s great variety—glycine
and alanine have only two or three carbon atoms; phenylalanine has nine.

Yet all of these molecules have similar properties—they are all soluble in water, they are all
both acidic and basic (amphoteric), they can all be joined with other amino acids to form
proteins. This is because the chemistry of organic molecules depends much less on the number or the arrangement of carbon or hydrogen atoms than on the other types of atoms (O,
N, S, P, Si...) in the molecule. We call parts of molecules containing small collections of these
other atoms functional groups, simply because they are groups of atoms that determine the
way the molecule works. All amino acids contain two functional groups: an amino (NH2
or NH) group and a carboxylic acid (CO2H) group (some contain other functional groups
as well).

That isn’t to say the carbon atoms aren’t important; they just play quite a different role
from those of the oxygen, nitrogen, and other atoms they are attached to. We can consider
the chains and rings of carbon atoms we fi nd in molecules as their skeletons, which support the
functional groups and allow them to take part in chemical interactions, much as your skeleton
supports your internal organs so they can interact with one another and work properly.

 - **The hydrocarbon framework is made up of chains and rings of carbon atoms, and it acts as a**
**support for the functional groups.**

We will see later how the interpretation of organic structures as hydrocarbon frameworks
supporting functional groups helps us to understand and rationalize the reactions of organic
molecules. It also helps us to devise simple, clear ways of representing molecules on paper. You
saw these structural diagrams in Chapter 1, and in the next section we shall teach you ways
to draw (and ways not to draw) molecules—the handwriting of chemistry. _This section is_
_extremely important because it will teach you how to communicate chemistry, clearly and sim-_
ply, throughout your life as a chemist.

###### Drawing molecules

 Be realistic

Below is another organic structure—again, you may be familiar with the molecule it represents; it is a fatty acid commonly called linoleic acid.


###### Organic skeletons

Organic molecules left to
decompose for millions of years
in the absence of light and
oxygen become literally carbon
skeletons—crude oil, for
example, is a mixture of
molecules consisting of nothing
but carbon and hydrogen, while
coal consists of little else but
carbon. Although the molecules
in coal and oil differ widely in
chemical structure, they have
one thing in common: no
functional groups. Many are
very unreactive: about the only
chemical reaction they can take
part in is combustion, which,
in comparison to most chemical
reactions that take place in
chemical laboratories, is an
extremely violent process. In
Chapter 5 we shall start to look
at the way that functional
groups direct the chemical
reactions of molecules.

- X-ray crystallography
discovers the structures of
molecules by observing the way
X-rays bounce off atoms in
crystalline solids. It gives clear
diagrams with the atoms
marked as circles and the bonds
as rods joining them together.


You may well have seen diagrams like these last two in older books—they used to be easy to
print (in the days before computers) because all the atoms were in a line and all the angles
were 90°. But are they realistic? We will consider ways of determining the shapes and structures of molecules in more detail in Chapter 3, but the picture below shows the structure of
linoleic acid determined by X-ray crystallography.

X-ray structure of linoleic acid

You can see that the chain of carbon atoms is not linear, but a zig-zag. Although our diagram
is just a two-dimensional representation of this three-dimensional structure, it seems reasonable to draw it as a zig-zag too.

linoleic acid

This gives us our fi rst guideline for drawing organic structures.



- **Guideline 1**

**Draw chains of atoms as zig-zags.**


Realism of course has its limits—the X-ray structure shows that the linoleic acid molecule is
in fact slightly bent in the vicinity of the double bonds; we have taken the liberty of drawing
it as a ‘straight zig-zag’. Similarly, close inspection of crystal structures like this reveals that
the angle of the zig-zag is about 109° when the carbon atom is not part of a double bond and
120° when it is. The 109° angle is the ‘tetrahedral angle’, the angle between two vertices of a
tetrahedron when viewed from its centre. In Chapter 4 we shall look at why carbon atoms take
up this particular arrangement of bonds. Our realistic drawing is a projection of a threedimensional structure onto fl at paper so we have to compromise.

###### Be economical

When we draw organic structures we try to be as realistic as we can be without putting in
superfl uous detail. Look at these three pictures.

(1) is immediately recognizable as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. You may not recognize
(2)—it’s also Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa—this time viewed from above. The frame is very
ornate, but the picture tells us as much about the painting as our rejected linear and 90° angle


-----

diagrams did about our fatty acid. They’re both correct—in their way—but sadly useless.
What we need when we draw molecules is the equivalent of (3). It gets across the idea of the
original, and includes all the detail necessary for us to recognize what it’s a picture of, and
leaves out the rest. And it was quick to draw—this picture was drawn in less than 10 minutes:
we haven’t got time to produce great works of art!
Because functional groups are the key to the chemistry of molecules, clear diagrams must
emphasize the functional groups and let the hydrocarbon framework fade into the background. Compare the diagrams below:

The second structure is the way that most organic chemists would draw linoleic acid. Notice
how the important carboxylic acid functional group stands out clearly and is no longer cluttered by all those Cs and Hs. The zig-zag pattern of the chain is much clearer too. And this
structure is much quicker to draw than any of the previous ones!
To get this diagram from the one above we’ve done two things. Firstly, we’ve got rid of all
the hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms, along with the bonds joining them to the
carbon atoms. Even without drawing the hydrogen atoms we know they’re there—we assume
that any carbon atom that doesn’t appear to have its potential for four bonds satisfi ed is also
attached to the appropriate number of hydrogen atoms. Secondly, we’ve rubbed out all the Cs
representing carbon atoms. We’re left with a zig-zag line, and we assume that every kink in
the line represents a carbon atom, as does the end of the line.


the end of the line
represents a C atom

this C atom must
also carry 3 H atoms
because only 1 bond
is shown


these C atoms must
also carry 1 H atom
because only 3 bonds
are shown for each atom


every kink in
the chain represents
a C atom

**OH**

**O**

these C atoms must
also carry 2 H atoms
because only 2 bonds
are shown for each atom


this H is shown
because it is
attached to an
atom other than C

all four bonds
are shown to this
C atom, so no
H atoms are
implied


We can turn these two simplifi cations into two more guidelines for drawing organic structures.



- What is ‘a good reason not
to’? One is if the C or H is part
of a functional group. Another
is if the C or H needs to be
highlighted in some way, for
example because it’s taking part
in a reaction. Don’t be too rigid
about these guidelines: they’re
not rules. It is better just to
learn by example (you’ll fi nd
plenty in this book): if it helps to
clarify, put it in; if it clutters and
confuses, leave it out. One thing
you must remember, though: if
you write a carbon atom as a
letter C then you must add all
the H atoms too. If you don’t
want to draw all the Hs, don’t
write C for carbon.



- **Guideline 2**

**Miss out the Hs attached to carbon atoms, along with the C–H bonds (unless there is a good**
**reason not to).**

- **Guideline 3**

**Miss out the capital Cs representing carbon atoms (unless there is a good reason not to).**


###### Be clear

Try drawing some of the amino acids represented on p. 16 in a similar way, using the three
guidelines. The bond angles at tetrahedral carbon atoms are about 109°. Make them look
about 109° projected on to a plane! (120° is a good compromise, and it makes the drawings
look neat.)
Start with leucine—earlier we drew it as the structure to the right. Get a piece of paper and
do it now. Once you have done this, turn the page to see how your drawing compares with our
suggestions.

The guidelines we gave were only guidelines, not rules, and it certainly does not matter which
way round you draw the molecule. The aim is to keep the functional groups clear and let the
skeleton fade into the background. That’s why the last two structures are all right—the carbon
atom shown as ‘C’ is part of a functional group (the carboxyl group) so it can stand out.
Now turn back to p. 16 and try redrawing the some of the other eight structures there using
the guidelines. Don’t look at our suggestions below until you’ve done them! Then compare
your drawings with our suggestions.

###### Structural diagrams can be modifi ed to suit the occasion

You’ll probably fi nd that you want to draw the same molecule in different ways on different
occasions to emphasize different points. Let’s carry on using leucine as an example. We mentioned before that an amino acid can act as an acid or as a base. When it acts as an acid, a base
(for example hydroxide, OH[−]) removes H[+] from the carboxylic acid group in a reaction we can
represent as:


**NH2**

**O**


**NH2**


**O**


**H**


**O**

**OH** + **H2O**

**O**


The product of this reaction has a negative charge on an oxygen atom. We have put it in
a circle to make it clearer, and we suggest you do the same when you draw charges: + and –
signs are easily mislaid. We shall discuss this type of reaction, the way in which reactions are
drawn, and what the ‘curly arrows’ in the diagram mean in Chapter 5. But for now, notice
that we drew out the CO2H as the fragment on the left because we wanted to show how
the O–H bond was broken when the base attacked. We modifi ed our diagram to suit our own
purposes.
When leucine acts as a base, the amino (NH2 ) group is involved. The nitrogen atom attaches
itself to a proton, forming a new bond using its lone pair.
We can represent this reaction as:



- Not all chemists put circles
round their plus and minus
charges—it’s a matter of
personal choice.

**H**

**CO2H**


**H**

**CO2H**


**H**


**H**

**H**

**N**


Notice how we drew in the lone pair this time because we wanted to show how it was involved
in the reaction. The oxygen atoms of the carboxylic acid groups also have lone pairs but we
didn’t draw them in because they weren’t relevant to what we were talking about. Neither did
we feel it was necessary to draw CO2H in full this time because none of the atoms or bonds in
the carboxylic acid functional group was involved in the reaction.

###### Structural diagrams can show three-dimensional information on a two-dimensional page

Of course, all the structures we have been drawing give only an idea of the real structure of
the molecules. For example, the carbon atom between the NH2 group and the CO2H group of
leucine has a tetrahedral arrangement of atoms around it, a fact which we have so far completely ignored.
We might want to emphasize this fact by drawing in the hydrogen atom we missed out at
this point, as in structure 1 (in the right-hand margin). We can then show that one of the
groups attached to this carbon atom comes towards us, out of the plane of the paper, and the
other one goes away from us, into the paper.
There are several ways of doing this. In structure 2, the bold, wedged bond suggests a perspective view of a bond coming towards you, while the hashed bond suggests a bond fading away
from you. The other two ‘normal’ bonds are in the plane of the paper.
Alternatively we could miss out the hydrogen atom and draw something a bit neater,
although slightly less realistic, as in structure 3. We can assume the missing hydrogen atom
is behind the plane of the paper because that is where the ‘missing’ vertex of the tetrahedron of atoms attached to the carbon atom lies. When you draw diagrams like these to indicate
the three dimensional shape of the molecule, try to keep the hydrocarbon framework in the



- A lone pair is a pair of
electrons that is not involved
in a chemical bond. We shall
discuss lone pairs in detail in
Chapter 4. Again, don’t worry
about what the curly arrows
in this diagram mean—we

Chapter 5.

plane of the paper and allow functional groups and other branches to project forwards out of
the paper or backwards into it.
These conventions allow us to give an idea of the three-dimensional shape (stereochemistry) of any organic molecule—you have already seen them in use in the diagram of the structure of palytoxin at the beginning of this chapter.



- **Reminder**

**Organic structural drawings should be realistic, economical, and clear.**

**We gave you three guidelines to help you achieve this when you draw structures:**

**•** **Guideline 1: Draw chains of atoms as zig-zags.**

**•** **Guideline 2: Miss out the Hs attached to the carbon atoms along with the C–H bonds.**

**•** **Guideline 3: Miss out the capital Cs representing carbon atoms.**


The guidelines we have given and the conventions we have illustrated in this section
have grown up over decades. They are not arbitrary pronouncements by some offi cial
body but are used by organic chemists because they work! We guarantee to follow them
for the rest of the book—try to follow them yourself whenever you draw an organic
structure. Before you ever draw a capital C or a capital H again, ask yourself whether it’s
really necessary!
Now that we have considered how to draw structures, we can return to some of the structural
types that we fi nd in organic molecules. Firstly, we’ll talk about hydrocarbon frameworks,
then about functional groups.

###### Hydrocarbon frameworks

Carbon as an element is unique in the variety of structures it can form. It is unusual
because it forms strong, stable bonds to the majority of elements in the periodic table,
including itself. It is this ability to form bonds to itself that leads to the variety of organic
structures that exist, and indeed to the possibility of life existing at all. Carbon may make
up only 0.2% of the earth’s crust, but it certainly deserves a whole branch of chemistry all
to itself.

###### Chains

The simplest class of hydrocarbon frameworks contains just chains of atoms. The fatty
acids we met earlier have hydrocarbon frameworks made of zig-zag chains of atoms, for
example. Polythene is a polymer whose hydrocarbon framework consists entirely of chains
of carbon atoms. The wiggly line at each end of this structure shows that we have drawn a
piece in the middle of the polythene molecule. The structure continues indefi nitely beyond
the wiggly lines.

a section of the structure of polythene

At the other end of the spectrum of complexity is this antibiotic, extracted from a fungus
in 1995 and aptly named linearmycin as it has a long linear chain. The chain of this antibiotic is so long that we have to wrap it round two corners just to get it on the page. We
haven’t drawn whether the CH3 and OH groups are in front of or behind the plane of
the paper because, at the time of writing this book, the stereochemistry of linearmycin is
unknown.

groups as CH3—we did this
because we didn’t want them to
get overlooked in such a large
structure. They are the only tiny
branches off this long winding
trunk.

###### Names for carbon chains

It is often convenient to refer to a chain of carbon atoms by a name indicating its length. You
have probably met some of these names before in the names of the simplest organic molecules, the alkanes. There are also commonly used abbreviations for these names: these can be
very useful in both writing about chemistry and in drawing chemical structures, as we shall
see shortly.

Names and abbreviations for carbon chains

Number of carbon Name of group Formula[†] Abbreviation Name of alkane
atoms in chain (= chain + H)

1 methyl –CH3 Me methane


2 ethyl –CH2CH3 Et ethane

3 propyl –CH2CH2CH3 Pr propane

4 butyl –(CH2)3CH3 Bu butane

5 pentyl –(CH2)4CH3 —[‡] pentane

6 hexyl –(CH2)5CH3 —[‡] hexane

7 heptyl –(CH2)6CH3 —[‡] heptane

8 octyl –(CH2)7CH3 —[‡] octane

9 nonyl –(CH2)8CH3 —[‡] nonane

10 decyl –(CH2)9CH3 —[‡] decane


† This representation is not recommended, except for CH3. ‡ Names for longer chains are not commonly
abbreviated.

###### Organic elements

You may notice that the abbreviations for the names of carbon chains look very much like the
symbols for chemical elements: this is deliberate, and these symbols are sometimes called
‘organic elements’. They can be used in chemical structures just like element symbols. It is
often convenient to use the ‘organic element’ symbols for short carbon chains for tidiness.
Here are some examples. Structure 1 to the right shows how we drew the structure of the amino
acid methionine on p. 20. The stick representing the methyl group attached to the sulfur atom
does, however, look a little odd. Most chemists would draw methionine as structure 2, with
‘Me’ representing the CH3 (methyl) group. Tetraethyllead used to be added to petrol to prevent
engines ‘knocking’, until it was shown to be a health hazard. Its structure (as you might easily
guess from the name) is easy to write as PbEt4 or Et4Pb.
Remember that these symbols (and names) can be used only for terminal chains of atoms.
We couldn’t abbreviate the structure of lysine to 3, for example, because Bu represents 4
and not 5.



- The names for shorter chains
(which you must learn) exist for
historical reasons; for chains of
fi ve or more carbon atoms, the
systematic names are based on
Greek number names.

###### Benzene's ring structure

In 1865, August Kekulé presented a
paper at the Academie des Sciences
in Paris suggesting a cyclic structure
for benzene, the inspiration for which
he ascribed to a dream. However,
was Kekulé the fi rst to suggest that
benzene was cyclic? Some believe
not and credit an Austrian schoolteacher, Josef Loschmidt, with the
fi rst depiction of cyclic benzene
structures. In 1861, 4 years before
Kekulé’s ‘dream’, Loschmidt published a book in which he represented benzene as a set of rings. It is
not certain whether Loschmidt or
Kekulé—or even a Scot named
Archibald Couper—got it right fi rst.

Before leaving carbon chains, we must mention one other very useful organic element symbol, R. R in a structure can mean anything—it’s a sort of wild card. For example, structure 6
would indicate any amino acid, if R = H it is glycine, if R = Me it is alanine. . . As we’ve mentioned before, and you will see later, the reactivity of organic molecules is so dependent on
their functional groups that the rest of the molecule can be irrelevant. In these cases, we can
choose just to call it R.

###### Carbon rings

Rings of atoms are also common in organic structures. You may have heard the famous story
of Auguste Kekulé fi rst realizing that benzene has a ring structure when he dreamed of snakes
biting their own tails. You have met benzene rings in phenylalanine and aspirin. Paracetamol
also has a structure based on a benzene ring.

When a benzene ring is attached to a molecule by only one of its carbon atoms (as in
phenylalanine, but not paracetamol or aspirin), we can call it a ‘phenyl’ group and give it
the organic element symbol Ph.

Any compound containing a benzene ring or a related (Chapter 7) ring system is known
as ‘aromatic’, and another useful organic element symbol related to Ph is Ar (for ‘aryl’).
While Ph always means C6H5, Ar can mean any substituted phenyl ring, in other words
phenyl with any number of the hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. Of course
Ar = argon too but there is no confusion as there are no organic compounds of argon.

For example, while PhOH always means phenol, ArOH could mean phenol, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (the antiseptic TCP), paracetamol, or aspirin (among many other substituted phenols).
Like R, the ‘wild card’ alkyl group, Ar is a ‘wild card’ aryl group.
The compound known as muscone has only relatively recently been made in the laboratory.
It is the pungent aroma that makes up the base-note of musk fragrances. Before chemists
had determined its structure and devised a laboratory synthesis the only source of musk was
the musk deer, now rare for this very reason. Muscone’s skeleton is a 13-membered ring of
carbon atoms.
The steroid hormones have several (usually four) rings fused together. These hormones are
testosterone and oestradiol, the important human male and female sex hormones.

buckminsterfullerene

One of the most elegant ring structures is shown above and is known as buckminsterfullerene. It consists solely of 60 carbon atoms in rings that curve back on themselves to form
a football-shaped cage. Count the number of bonds at any junction and you will see they add
up to four so no hydrogens need be added. This compound is C60. Note that you can’t see all
the atoms as some are behind the sphere.
Rings of carbon atoms are given names starting with ‘cyclo’, followed by the name for the
carbon chain with the same number of carbon atoms. Structure 1 shows chrysanthemic acid,
part of the naturally occurring pesticides called pyrethrins (an example appears in Chapter 1),
which contains a cyclopropane ring. Propane has three carbon atoms. Cyclopropane is a
three-membered ring. Grandisol (structure 2), an insect pheromone used by male boll weevils
to attract females, has a structure based on a cyclobutane ring. Butane has four carbon atoms.
Cyclobutane is a four-membered ring. Cyclamate (structure 3), formerly used as an artifi cial
sweetener, contains a cyclohexane ring. Hexane has six carbon atoms. Cyclohexane is a sixmembered ring.

###### Branches

Hydrocarbon frameworks rarely consist of single rings or chains, but are often branched.
Rings, chains, and branches are all combined in structures like that of the marine toxin
palytoxin that we met at the beginning of the chapter, polystyrene, a polymer made of sixmembered rings dangling from linear carbon chains, or of β-carotene, the compound that
makes carrots orange.

Just like some short straight carbon chains, some short branched carbon chains are given
names and organic element symbols. The most common is the isopropyl group. Lithium
diisopropylamide (also called LDA) is a strong base commonly used in organic synthesis.


There are two more isomers of the butyl group, both of which have common names and
abbreviations. The sec-butyl group (s-butyl or s-Bu) has a methyl and an ethyl group joined to
the same carbon atom. It appears in an organolithium compound, sec-butyl lithium, used to
introduce lithium atoms into organic molecules.

Notice how the ‘propyl’ part of ‘isopropyl’ still indicates three carbon atoms; they are just
joined together in a different way—in other words, as an isomer of the straight chain propyl
group. Sometimes, to avoid confusion, the straight chain alkyl groups are called ‘n-alkyl’ (for
example, n-Pr, n-Bu)—n for ‘normal’—to distinguish them from their branched counterparts.
Iproniazid is an antidepressant drug with i-Pr in both structure and name. ‘Isopropyl’ may be
abbreviated to i-Pr, [i]Pr, or Pr[i]. We shall use the fi rst in this book, but you may see the others
used elsewhere.

The isobutyl (i-Bu) group is a CH2 group joined to an i-Pr group. It is i-PrCH2–. Two isobutyl
groups are present in the reducing agent diisobutyl aluminium hydride (DIBAL). The painkiller ibuprofen (marketed as Nurofen[®]) contains an isobutyl group. Notice how the invented
name ibuprofen is a medley of ‘ibu’ (from _i-Bu for isobutyl) + ‘pro’ (for propyl, the three-_
carbon unit shown in brown) + ‘fen’ (for the phenyl ring). We will talk about the way in which
compounds are named later in this chapter.

**something fundamental about the molecule and we shall use them when we describe reactions.**

This quick architectural tour of some of the molecular edifi ces built by nature and by
humans serves just as an introduction to some of the hydrocarbon frameworks you will meet
in the rest of this chapter and this book. Yet, fortunately for us, however complicated the
hydrocarbon framework might be, it serves only as a support for the functional groups. And,
by and large, a functional group in one molecule behaves in much the same way as it does in
another molecule. What we now need to do, and we start in the next section, is to introduce
you to some functional groups and explain why it is that their attributes are the key to understanding organic chemistry.

###### Functional groups

If you bubble ethane gas (CH3CH3, or EtH) through acids, bases, oxidizing agents, reducing
agents—in fact almost any chemical you can think of—it will remain unchanged. Just about
the only thing you can do with it is burn it. Yet ethanol (CH3CH2OH, or preferably EtOH—
structure in the margin) not only burns, it reacts with acids, bases, and oxidizing agents.
The difference between ethanol and ethane is the functional group—the OH, or hydroxyl
group. We know that these chemical properties (being able to react with acids, bases, and
oxidizing agents) are properties of the hydroxyl group and not just of ethanol because other
compounds containing OH groups (in other words, other alcohols) have similar properties,
whatever their hydrocarbon frameworks.
Your understanding of functional groups will be the key to your understanding of organic
chemistry. We shall therefore now go on to meet some of the most important functional
groups. We won’t say much about the properties of each group; that will come in Chapter 5

and later. Your task at this stage is to learn to recognize them when they appear in structures,
so make sure you learn their names. The classes of compound associated with some functional groups also have names, for example compounds containing the hydroxyl group are
known as alcohols. Learn these names too as they are more important than the systematic
names of individual compounds. We’ve told you a few snippets of information about each
group to help you to get to know something of the group’s character.

###### Alkanes contain no functional groups

The alkanes are the simplest class of organic molecules because they contain no functional
groups. They are extremely unreactive and therefore rather boring as far as the organic chemist is concerned. However, their unreactivity can be a bonus, and alkanes such as pentane and
hexane are often used as solvents, especially for the purifi cation of organic compounds. Just
about the only thing alkanes will do is burn—methane, propane, and butane are all used as
domestic fuels, and petrol is a mixture of alkanes containing largely isooctane.

###### Alkenes (sometimes called olefi ns) contain C=C double bonds

It may seem strange to classify a type of bond as a functional group, but you will see later that
C==C double bonds impart reactivity to an organic molecule just as functional groups consisting of, say, oxygen or nitrogen atoms do. Some of the compounds produced by plants and used
by perfumers are alkenes (see Chapter 1). For example, pinene has a smell evocative of pine
forests, while limonene smells of citrus fruits.
You’ve already met the orange pigment β-carotene. Eleven C=C double bonds make up
most of its structure. Coloured organic compounds often contain chains or rings of C=C
double bonds like this. In Chapter 7 you will fi nd out why this is so.

β-carotene

###### Alkynes contain C≡C triple bonds

Just like C=C double bonds, C≡C triple bonds have a special type of reactivity associated
with them, so it’s useful to call a C≡C triple bond a functional group. Alkynes are linear so we


-----

draw them with four carbon atoms in a straight line. Alkynes are not as widespread in
nature as alkenes, but one fascinating class of compounds containing C≡C triple bonds is a
group of antitumour agents discovered during the 1980s. Calicheamicin is a member of
this group. The high reactivity of this combination of functional groups enables calicheamicin to attack DNA and prevent cancer cells from proliferating. For the fi rst time we have
drawn a molecule in three dimensions, with two bonds crossing one another—can you see
the shape?

###### Alcohols (R–OH) contain a hydroxyl (OH) group

We’ve already talked about the hydroxyl group in ethanol and other alcohols. Carbohydrates
are peppered with hydroxyl groups; sucrose has eight of them, for example (a more threedimensional picture of the sucrose molecule appears in Chapter 1, p.3).

**HO**


###### Saturated and unsaturated

In an alkane, each carbon atom
is joined to four other atoms
(C or H). It has no potential for
forming more bonds and is
therefore saturated. In alkenes,
the carbon atoms making up the
C=C double bond are attached
to only three atoms each. They
still have the potential to bond
with one more atom, and are
therefore unsaturated. In general, carbon atoms attached to
four other atoms are saturated;
those attached to three, two,
or one are unsaturated.
Remember that R may mean
any alkyl group.

Molecules containing hydroxyl groups are often soluble in water, and living things often
attach sugar groups, containing hydroxyl groups, to otherwise insoluble organic compounds
to keep them in solution in the cell. Calicheamicin, a molecule we have just mentioned, contains a string of sugars for just this reason. The liver carries out its task of detoxifying unwanted
organic compounds by repeatedly hydroxylating them until they are water soluble, and they
are then excreted in the bile or urine.

###### Ethers (R[1]–O–R[2]) contain an alkoxy group (–OR)

The name ether refers to any compound that has two alkyl groups linked through an oxygen
atom. ‘Ether’ is also used as an everyday name for diethyl ether, Et2O. You might compare this
use of the word ‘ether’ with the common use of the word ‘alcohol’ to mean ethanol. Diethyl
ether is a highly fl ammable solvent that boils at only 35°C. It used to be used as an anaesthetic.
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is another commonly used solvent and is a cyclic ether.
Brevetoxin B (overleaf) is a fascinating naturally occurring compound that was synthesized
in the laboratory in 1995. It is packed with ether functional groups in ring sizes from 6 to 8.

###### Amines (R–NH2) contain the amino (NH2) group

We met the amino group when we were discussing the amino acids: we mentioned that it
was this group that gave these compounds their basic properties. Amines often have
powerful fi shy smells: the smell of putrescine is particularly foul. It is formed as meat
decays. Many neurologically active compounds are also amines: amphetamine is a notorious
stimulant.



- If we want a structure to
contain more than one ‘R’, we
give the Rs numbers and call
them R[1], R[2]. . . Thus R[1]–O–R[2]
means an ether with two
different unspecifi ed alkyl
groups. (Not R1, R2. . ., which
would mean 1 × R, 2 × R...)

###### Nitro compounds (R–NO2) contain the nitro group (NO2)

The nitro group (NO2) is sometimes incorrectly drawn with fi ve bonds to nitrogen which as
you will see in Chapter 4 is impossible. Make sure you draw it correctly when you need to draw
it out in detail. If you write just NO2 you are all right!
Several nitro groups in one molecule can make it quite unstable and even explosive. Three
nitro groups give the most famous explosive of all, trinitrotoluene (TNT), its kick. However,
functional groups refuse to be stereotyped. Nitrazepam also contains a nitro group, but this
compound is marketed as Mogadon[®], the sleeping pill.

Because alkyl halides have
similar properties, chemists use
yet another wild card organic
element symbol, X, as a
convenient substitute for Cl,
Br, or I and sometimes F: R–X
is any alkyl halide.


###### Alkyl halides (fl uorides R–F, chlorides R–Cl, bromides R–Br, or iodides R–I) contain the fl uoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo groups

These four functional groups have similar properties, although alkyl iodides are the most
reactive and alkyl fl uorides the least. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is one of the most widely used
polymers—it has a chloro group on every other carbon atom along a linear hydrocarbon
framework. Methyl iodide (MeI), on the other hand, is a dangerous carcinogen since it reacts
with DNA and can cause mutations in the genetic code. These compounds are also known as
haloalkanes (fl uoroalkanes, chloroalkanes, bromoalkanes, or iodoalkanes).

###### Aldehydes (R–CHO) and ketones (R[1]–CO–R[2]) contain the carbonyl group C=O

Aldehydes can be formed by oxidizing alcohols—in fact the liver detoxifi es ethanol in the
bloodstream by oxidizing it fi rst to acetaldehyde (ethanal, CH3CHO) (see p. 28). Acetaldehyde
in the blood is the cause of hangovers. Aldehydes often have pleasant smells—2-methylundecanal is a key component of the fragrance of Chanel No. 5, and ‘raspberry ketone’ is the major
component of the fl avour and smell of raspberries.

###### Carboxylic acids (R–CO2H) contain the carboxyl group CO2H

As their name implies, compounds containing the carboxylic acid (CO2H) group can react
with bases, losing a proton to form carboxylate salts. Edible carboxylic acids have sharp fl avours and several are found in fruits—citric, malic, and tartaric acids are found in lemons,
apples, and grapes, respectively.

###### Esters (R[1]–CO2R[2]) contain a carboxyl group with an extra alkyl group (CO2R)

Fats are esters; in fact they contain three ester groups. They are formed in the body by condensing glycerol, a compound with three hydroxyl groups, with three fatty acid molecules.
Other, more volatile, esters have pleasant, fruity smells and fl avours. These three are components of the fl avours of bananas, rum, and apples:

###### Amides (R–CONH2, R[1]–CONHR[2], or R[1]–CONR[2]R[3])

Proteins are amides: they are formed when the carboxylic acid group of one amino acid condenses with the amino group of another to form an amide linkage (also known as a peptide
bond). One protein molecule can contain hundreds of amide bonds. Aspartame, the artifi cial
sweetener marketed as NutraSweet[®], on the other hand, contains just two amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine, joined through one amide bond. Paracetamol is also an amide.

###### Nitriles or cyanides (R–CN) contain the cyano group –C≡N

Nitrile groups can be introduced into molecules by reacting potassium cyanide with alkyl
halides. The organic nitrile group has quite different properties from those associated with
lethal inorganic cyanide: laetrile, for example, is extracted from apricot kernels, and was once
developed as an anticancer drug.

###### Acyl chlorides (acid chlorides, R–COCl)

Acyl chlorides are reactive compounds used to make esters and amides. They are derivatives
of carboxylic acids with the –OH replaced by –Cl, and are too reactive to be found in nature.



- The terms ‘saturated fats’
and ‘unsaturated fats’ are
familiar—they refer to whether
the R groups are saturated
(no C=C double bonds) or
unsaturated (contain C=C
double bonds)—see the box on
p. 29. Fats containing R groups
with several double bonds (for
example those that are esters
formed from linoleic acid, which
we met at the beginning of this
chapter) are known as
‘polyunsaturated’.

###### A heteroatom is an atom that is not C or H

You’ve seen that a functional
group is essentially any deviation from an alkane structure,
either because the molecule has
fewer hydrogen atoms than an
alkane (alkenes, alkynes) or
because it contains a collection
of atoms that are not C and not
H. There is a useful term for
these ‘different’ atoms: heteroatoms. A heteroatom is any
atom in an organic molecule
other than C or H.

- Don’t confuse oxidation level
with oxidation state. Oxidation
level is determined by the
number of heteroatoms bonded
to carbon while oxidation state
is determined by the number
of bonds to carbon, including
those to C and H. In all of
these compounds, carbon has
four bonds and is in oxidation
state +4.


###### Carbon atoms carrying functional groups can be classifi ed by oxidation level

All functional groups are different, but some are more different than others. For example, the
structures of a carboxylic acid, an ester, and an amide are all very similar: in each case the
carbon atom carrying the functional group is bonded to two heteroatoms, one of the bonds
being a double bond. You will see in Chapter 10 that this similarity in structure is mirrored in
the reactions of these three types of compounds and in the ways in which they can be interconverted. Carboxylic acids, esters, and amides can be changed one into another by reaction
with simple reagents such as water, alcohols, or amines plus appropriate catalysts. To change
them into aldehydes or alcohols requires a different type or reagent, a reducing agent (a reagent which adds hydrogen atoms). We say that the carbon atoms carrying functional groups
that can be interconverted without the need for reducing agents (or oxidizing agents) have the
same oxidation level—in this case, we call it the ‘carboxylic acid oxidation level’.

carboxylic acids esters amides nitriles acyl chlorides

In fact, amides can quite easily be converted into nitriles just by dehydration (removal of water),
so we must give nitrile carbon atoms the same oxidation level as carboxylic acids, esters, and
amides. Maybe you’re beginning to see the structural similarity between these four functional
groups that you could have used to assign their oxidation level? In all four cases, the carbon
atom has three bonds to heteroatoms, and only one to C or H. It doesn’t matter how many heteroatoms there are, just how many bonds to them. Having noticed this, we can also assign both
carbon atoms in ‘CFC-113’, one of the environmentally unfriendly aerosol propellants/refrigerants that have caused damage to the earth’s ozone layer, to the carboxylic acid oxidation level.

aldehydes ketones acetals dichloromethane

Aldehydes and ketones contain a carbon atom with two bonds to heteroatoms; they are at
the ‘aldehyde oxidation level’. The common laboratory solvent dichloromethane CH2Cl2 also
has two bonds to heteroatoms, so it too contains a carbon atom at the aldehyde oxidation
level, as do acetals.


-----

Alcohols, ethers, and alkyl halides have a carbon atom with only _one single bond to a_
heteroatom. We assign these the ‘alcohol oxidation level’, and they are all easily made from
alcohols without oxidation or reduction.

The small class of compounds that have a carbon atom with four bonds to heteroatoms is
related to CO2 and best described as at the carbon dioxide oxidation level.
Alkenes and alkynes obviously don’t fi t easily into these categories as they have no bonds to
heteroatoms. Alkenes can be made from alcohols by dehydration without any oxidation or
reduction so it seems sensible to put them in the alcohol column. Similarly, alkynes and aldehydes are related by hydration/dehydration without oxidation or reduction.

###### Naming compounds

So far, we have talked a lot about compounds by name. Many of the names we’ve used (palytoxin, muscone, brevetoxin) are simple names given to complicated molecules without
regard for the actual structure or function of the molecule—these three names, for example,
are all derived from the name of the organism from which the compound was fi rst extracted.


-----

They are known as trivial names, not because they are unimportant, but because they are
used in everyday scientifi c conversation.
Names like this are fi ne for familiar compounds that are widely used and referred to by
chemists, biologists, doctors, nurses, and perfumers alike. But there are over 16 million known
organic compounds. They can’t all have simple names, and no-one would remember them if
they did. For this reason, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)
have developed systematic nomenclature, a set of rules that allows any compound to be
given a unique name that can be deduced directly from its chemical structure. Conversely, a
chemical structure can be deduced from its systematic name.
The problem with systematic names is that they tend to be grotesquely unpronounceable for
anything but the most simple molecules. In everyday speech and writing, chemists therefore
do tend to disregard them, and use a mixture of systematic and trivial names. Nonetheless, it’s
important to know how the rules work. We shall look next at systematic nomenclature, before
going on to look at the real language of chemistry.

###### Systematic nomenclature

There isn’t space here to explain all the rules for giving systematic names for compounds—
they fi ll several desperately dull volumes, and there’s no point knowing them anyway since
computers will do the naming for you. What we will do is to explain the principles underlying
systematic nomenclature. You should understand these principles because they provide the
basis for the names used by chemists for the vast majority of compounds that do not have
their own trivial names.
Systematic names can be divided into three parts: one describes the hydrocarbon framework, one describes the functional groups, and one indicates where the functional groups are
attached to the skeleton.
You have already met the names for some simple fragments of hydrocarbon framework (methyl,
ethyl, propyl). Adding a hydrogen atom to these alkyl fragments and changing -yl to -ane makes
the alkanes and their names. You should hardly need reminding of their structures:

Names for the hydrocarbon framework


-----

The name of a functional group can be added to the name of a hydrocarbon framework
either as a suffi x or as a prefi x. Some examples follow. It is important to count all of the carbon atoms in the chain, even if one of them is part of a functional group: pentanenitrile is
actually BuCN.

Compounds with functional groups attached to a benzene ring are named in a similar way.

###### Numbers are used to locate functional groups

Sometimes a number can be included in the name to indicate which carbon atom the functional group is attached to. None of the above list needed a number—check that you can see
why not for each one. When numbers are used, the carbon atoms are counted from one end.
In most cases, either of two numbers could be used (depending on which end you count
from); the one chosen is always the lower of the two. Again, some examples will illustrate this
point. Notice again that some functional groups are named by prefi xes, some by suffi xes, and
that the number always goes directly before the functional group name.

One carbon atom can have as many as four functional groups: this limit is reached with

Again, the numbers indicate how far the functional groups are from the end of the carbon
chain. Counting must always be from the same end for each functional group. Notice how we
use di-, tri-, and tetra- if there is more than one of the same functional group.
With cyclic compounds, there isn’t an end to the chain, but we can use numbers to show
the distance between the two groups—start from the carbon atom carrying one of the functional groups, then count round. These rules work for hydrocarbon frameworks that are

###### Ortho, meta, and para

With substituted benzene rings, an alternative way of identifying the positions of the substituents is to use the terms ortho, meta, and para. Ortho compounds are 1,2-disubstituted,
_meta compounds are 1,3-disubstituted, and_ _para compounds are 1,4-disubstituted. Some_
examples should make this clear.

**Cl**

**H2N**

**Cl**


3-chlorobenzoic acid
or meta-chlorobenzoic acid
or m-chlorobenzoic acid


4-aminophenol
or para-aminophenol
or p-aminophenol


Beware! Ortho, meta, and para
are used in chemistry to mean
other things too: you may come
across orthophosphoric acid,
metastable states, and
paraformaldehyde—these
have nothing to do with the
substitution patterns of
benzene rings.


The terms ortho, meta, and para are used by chemists because they’re easier to remember
than numbers, and the words carry with them chemical meaning. _Ortho shows that two_
groups are next to each other on the ring even though the atoms may not happen to be numbered 1 and 2. They are one example of the way in which chemists don’t always use systematic
nomenclature but revert to more convenient ‘trivial’ terms. We consider trivial names in the
next section.

###### What do chemists really call compounds?

The point of naming a compound is to be able to communicate with other chemists. Most
chemists are happiest communicating chemistry by means of structural diagrams, and structural drawings are far more important than any sort of chemical nomenclature. That’s why
we explained in detail how to draw structures, but only gave an outline of how to name compounds. Good diagrams are easy to understand, quick to draw, and diffi cult to misinterpret.


1,2-dichlorobenzene
or ortho-dichlorobenzene
or o-dichlorobenzene



- **Always give a diagram alongside a name unless it really is something very simple, such as**
**ethanol.**


But we do need to be able to communicate by speech and by writing as well. In principle we
could do this by using systematic names. In practice, however, the full systematic names of
anything but the simplest molecules are far too clumsy for use in everyday chemical speech.
There are several alternatives, mostly based on a mixture of trivial and systematic names.

###### Names for well-known and widely used simple compounds

A few simple compounds are called by trivial names not because the systematic names are
complicated, but just out of habit. We know them so well that we use their familiar names.


-----

You may have met the compound on the right before and perhaps called it ethanoic acid, its
systematic name. But in a chemical laboratory everyone would refer to this acid as acetic acid,
its trivial name. The same is true for all these common substances.

Trivial names like this are often long-lasting, well-understood historical names that are less
easy to confuse than their systematic counterparts. ‘Acetaldehyde’ is easier to distinguish
from ‘ethanol’ than is ‘ethanal’.
Trivial names also extend to fragments of structures containing functional groups.
Acetone, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid all contain the acetyl group (MeCO-, ethanoyl) abbreviated Ac and chemists often use this organic element symbol in writing AcOH for acetic
acid or EtOAc for ethyl acetate. Chemists use special names for four fragments because they
have mechanistic as well as structural signifi cance. These are vinyl and allyl, phenyl and
benzyl.

the vinyl group the allyl group the phenyl group: Ph the benzyl group: Bn

Giving the vinyl group a name allows chemists to use simple trivial names for compounds
like vinyl chloride, the material that polymerizes to give PVC (polyvinyl chloride) but the
importance of the name lies more in the difference in reactivity (Chapter 15) between the
vinyl and allyl groups.

**Cl** **Cl** **Cl** **Cl** **Cl** **Cl** **Cl**

vinyl chloride a section of the structure of PVC—Poly Vinyl Chloride

The allyl group gets its name from garlic (Allium sp.) because it makes up part of the structure of the compounds on the right responsible for the taste and smell of garlic.
Allyl and vinyl are different in that the vinyl group is attached directly to a double-bonded
C=C carbon atom, while the allyl group is attached to a carbon atom adjacent to the C=C
double bond. The difference is extremely important chemically: allyl compounds are typically quite reactive, while vinyl compounds are fairly unreactive.
For some reason, the allyl and vinyl groups have never acquired organic element symbols,
but the benzyl group has and it is Bn. It is again important not to confuse the benzyl group
with the phenyl group: the phenyl group is joined through a carbon atom in the ring, while
the benzyl group is joined through a carbon atom attached to the ring. Phenyl compounds
are typically unreactive but benzyl compounds are often reactive. Phenyl is like vinyl, and
benzyl is like allyl. We shall review all the organic element symbols you have met at the end
of the chapter.

###### Names for more complicated but still well-known molecules

Complicated molecules that have been isolated from natural sources are always given trivial
names because in these cases the systematic names really are impossible! Strychnine is a
famous poison featured in many detective stories and a molecule with a beautiful structure.
All chemists refer to it as strychnine as the systematic name is virtually unpronounceable.
Two groups of experts at IUPAC and Chemical Abstracts also have different ideas on the systematic name for strychnine. Others like this are penicillin, DNA, and folic acid.

Even fairly simple but important molecules, the amino acids for example, which have systematic names that are relatively easy to understand, are normally referred to by their trivial

A very fl exible way of getting new, simple names for compounds can be to combine a bit of
systematic nomenclature with trivial nomenclature. Alanine is a simple amino acid that
occurs in proteins. Add a phenyl group and you have phenylalanine, which is a more complex
amino acid also in proteins. Toluene, the common name for methylbenzene, can be combined (both chemically and in making names for compounds!) with three nitro groups to give
the famous explosive trinitrotoluene or TNT.

###### Compounds for which chemists use systematic names

You may be surprised to hear that practising organic chemists use systematic names at all in view
of what we have just described, but they do! Systematic names really begin with derivatives of


-----

pentane (C5H12) since the prefi x pent- means fi ve, whereas but- does not mean four. Chemists
refer to simple derivatives of open-chain and cyclic compounds with 5 to about 20 carbon atoms
by their systematic names, providing that there is no common name in use. Here are some
examples.

**OH**

**HO**

cyclopentadiene cycloocta- cyclododeca- 2,7-dimethyl-3,5-octadiyne-2,7-diol

1,5-diene 1,5,9-triene

**Br** **CO2H** **CHO**

11-bromo-undecanoic acid non-2-enal


These names contain a syllable that tells you the framework size: penta- for C5, octa- for C8,
nona for C9, undeca- for C11, and dodeca- for C12. These names are easily worked out from the
structures and, what is more important, you get a clear idea of the structure from the name.
One of them might make you stop and think a bit (which one?), but the others are clear even
when heard without a diagram to look at.

###### Complicated molecules with no trivial names

When chemists make complex new compounds in the laboratory, they publish the method for
making them in a chemical journal, giving their full systematic names in the experimental
account, however long and clumsy those names may be. But in the text of the paper, and while
talking in the laboratory about the compounds they have made, they will just call them ‘the
amine’ or ‘the alkene’. Everyone knows which amine or alkene is meant because at some point
they remember seeing a chemical structure of the compound. This is the best strategy for talking about almost any molecule: draw a structure, then give the compound a ‘tag’ name like ‘the
amine’ or ‘the acid’. In written chemistry it’s often easiest to give every chemical structure a
‘tag’ number as well. To illustrate what we mean, let’s talk about a recent drug synthesis.

This potential anti-obesity drug 1, which might overcome insulin resistance in diabetics,
was recently made at Abbott laboratories from a simpler intermediate 4. In the published
work the drug is called ‘a selective DGAT-1 inhibitor’ but that doesn’t mean much to us. In
the text of the paper they refer to it by its compound number 1. How much more sensible
than using its systematic name: _trans-(1R,2R)-2-(4′-(3-phenylureido)biphenylcarbonyl)_
cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. The simpler intermediate they call ‘the ketoacid 4’ or ‘the
aryl bromide 4’ or ‘the free acid 4’ depending on what aspect of its structure they want
to emphasize. Notice that in both cases a clear diagram of the structure appears with its
number.

###### How should you name compounds?

So what should you call a compound? It really depends on circumstances, but you won’t
go far wrong if you follow the example of this book. We shall use the names for compounds


-----

that real chemists use. There’s no need to learn all the commonly used names for compounds
now, but you should log them in your memory as you come across them. Never allow yourself
to pass a compound name by unless you are sure you know what chemical structure it
refers to.



- **Our advice on chemical names—six points in order of importance**

We’ve met a great many molecules in this chapter. Most of them were just there to illustrate
points so don’t learn their structures! Instead, learn to recognize the names of the functional
groups they contain. However, there were 10 names for simple compounds and three for common solvents that we advised you to learn. Cover up the right-hand part of each column and
draw the structures for these 14 compounds.

up the most important ones. But, to reiterate, make sure you never pass a compound name by
without being absolutely sure what it refers to—draw a structure to check.

###### Introduction

 Organic structures can be determined accurately and quickly by spectroscopy

Having urged you, in the last chapter, to draw structures realistically, we now need to answer
the question: what is realistic? How do we know what structures molecules actually have?
Make no mistake about this important point: we really do know what shape molecules have. You
wouldn’t be far wrong if you said that the single most important development in organic
chemistry in modern times is just this certainty, as well as the speed with which we can be
certain. What has caused this revolution can be stated in a word—spectroscopy.



- **What is spectroscopy?**

Rays or waves interact with molecules Spectroscopy Tells us about

X-rays are scattered by atoms Measures the scattering pattern Bond lengths and angles

Radio waves make nuclei resonate Plots charts of resonant The symmetry and connectivity
frequencies of the hydrocarbon skeleton

Infrared waves make bonds vibrate Plots charts of absorption The functional groups in the
molecule


###### Structure of the chapter

We shall fi rst consider structure determination as a whole and then introduce three different
methods:

 - mass spectrometry (to determine mass of the molecule and atomic composition)

 - nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (to determine symmetry, branching,
and connectivity in the molecule)

 - infrared spectroscopy (to determine the functional groups in the molecule).

- If you would like more details
of any of the spectroscopic
methods we discuss, you should
refer to one of the specialized
books listed in the ‘further
reading’ section at the end of
this chapter.


Of these, NMR is more important than all the rest put together and so we shall return to it
in more detail in Chapter 13. Then in Chapter 18, after we’ve discussed a wider range of molecules, there will be a review chapter to bring the ideas together and show you how unknown
structures are really determined.

###### X-ray is the fi nal appeal

In Chapter 2 we suggested you draw saturated carbon chains as zig-zags and not in straight
lines with 90° or 180° bond angles. This is because we know they are zig-zags. The X-ray crystal
structure of the ‘straight’ chain diacid, hexanedioic acid, is shown below. You can clearly see
the zig-zag chain, the planar carboxylic acid groups, and even the hydrogen atoms coming
towards you and going away from you. It obviously makes sense to draw this molecule realisti_cally, as in the second drawing._

- **Coenzymes are biochemical**
reagents that work hand-inhand with enzymes to catalyse

- The trivial name ‘methoxatin’
has a systematic alternative:
4,5-dihydro-4,5-dioxo-1Hpyrrolo[2,3-f ]quinoline-2,7,9tricarboxylic acid. Both are valid
names. There are no prizes for
guessing which one is used
more often.


X-ray crystal structures are determined by allowing a sample of a crystalline compound to
diffract X-rays. From the resulting diffraction pattern, it is possible to deduce the precise spatial arrangement of the atoms in the molecule—except, usually, the hydrogen atoms, which
are too light to diffract the X-rays and whose position must be inferred from the rest of the
structure. This is one question that X-ray answers better than any other method: what shape
does a molecule have? Another important problem it can solve is the structure of an important new unknown compound. There are subterranean bacteria, for example, that use methane as an energy source. It is amazing that bacteria manage to convert methane into anything
useful, and, of course, chemists really wanted to know how they did it. In 1979 it was found
that the bacteria use a coenzyme, given the trivial name ‘methoxatin’, to oxidize methane to
methanol. Methoxatin was a new compound with an unknown structure and could be
obtained in only very small amounts. It proved exceptionally diffi cult to solve the structure
by NMR but eventually methoxatin was found by X-ray crystallography to be a polycyclic
tricarboxylic acid.

###### X-ray crystallography has its limitations

If X-ray crystallography is so powerful, why do we bother with other methods? There are two
reasons:

 - X-ray crystallography works by the scattering of X-rays from electrons and requires
crystalline solids. If an organic compound is a liquid or is a solid but does not form
good crystals, its structure cannot be determined in this way.

 - X-ray crystallography is a science in its own right, requiring specialized skills, and a
structure determination can take a long time. Modern methods have reduced this
time to a matter of hours or less, but nonetheless by contrast a modern NMR machine
with a robot attachment can run more than 100 spectra overnight. We normally use
NMR routinely and reserve X-rays for diffi cult unknown structures and for
determining the detailed shape of important molecules.

###### X-ray crystallography is not infallible!

Because it cannot usually ‘see’ H atoms, it is important to appreciate that X-ray crystallography is not infallible: it can still get
things wrong. A famous example is the antibiotic diazonamide A, which from 1991 (when it was isolated from a marine
organism) until 2001 (when the error was realized) was thought to have the structure shown on the right. It has the same
mass as the real structure on the left, and X-ray crystallography was unable to tell the O and the N apart. Only when the
compound was synthesized did the error become apparent, and the fact that the correct structure was indeed that on the left
was confi rmed by the fact that synthetic material of this structure made in 2002 was identical with the natural product.

###### Outline of structure determination by spectroscopy

Put yourself in these situations, regularly encountered by professional chemists:

 - You notice an unexpected product from a chemical reaction.

 - You discover a previously unknown compound in a plant extract.


-----

 - You detect a suspected food contaminant and need to know what it is.

 - You are routinely checking purity during the manufacture of a drug.

In all cases, except perhaps the second, you would need a quick and reliable answer. Suppose
you are trying to identify the heart drug propranolol. You would fi rst want to know the molecular weight and atomic composition, and these would come from a mass spectrum: propranolol has a molecular weight (relative molecular mass) of 259 and the composition C16H21NO2.
Next you would need the carbon skeleton—this would come from NMR, which would reveal
the three fragments shown below.

**OR** **CH3**


**O** **N**

**OH**

**CH3**

**Z** **CH3**



- NMR does not literally break
up the molecule into fragments,
but it does view molecules as
pieces of hydrocarbon linked
together.


There are many ways in which the fragments seen by NMR could be joined together and at
this stage you would have no idea whether the oxygen atoms were present as OH groups or as
ethers, whether the nitrogen would be an amine or not, and whether Y and Z might or might
not be the same atom, say N. More information comes from the infrared spectrum, which
highlights the functional groups, and which would show that there is an OH and an NH in
the molecule but not other functional groups such as CN or NO2. This still leaves a variety of
possible structures, and these could fi nally be distinguished by the details revealed by [1]H
NMR. We will deal with [1]H NMR only briefl y in this chapter because it is more complicated
than [13]C NMR, but we will return to it in Chapter 13.
Now we must go through each of these methods and see how they give us information about
the propranolol molecule.

- Mass spectrometry is
different from other forms of
spectroscopy because it
measures mass rather than the
absorption of energy.


###### Mass spectrometry

 Mass spectrometry weighs the molecule

It’s not easy to weigh a neutral molecule, and a mass spectrometer works by measuring the
mass of a charged ion instead: the charge makes the molecule controllable by an electric fi eld.
A mass spectrometer therefore has three basic components:

 - something to volatilize and ionize the molecule into a beam of charged particles

 - something to focus the beam so that particles of the same mass:charge ratio are
separated from all others and

 - something to detect the particles.

All spectrometers in common use operate in a high vacuum and use one of several methods
to convert neutral molecules into cations, the most common being electron impact, chemi**cal ionization, and electrospray.**


-----

###### Mass spectrometry by electron impact

In electron impact (EI) mass spectrometry the molecule is bombarded with highly energetic
electrons that knock a weakly bound electron out of the molecule. If you think this is strange,
think of throwing bricks at a brick wall: the bricks can’t stick to the wall but can knock loose
bricks off the top of the wall. Losing a single electron leaves behind an unpaired electron and
a positive charge. The electron that is lost will be one of relatively high energy (the bricks come
from the top of the wall), and typically one not involved in bonding, for example an electron
from a lone pair.

Thus ammonia gives NH3+ • and a ketone gives R2C�O+ •. These unstable species are known
as radical cations, and being charged they are accelerated by an electric fi eld and focused
onto the detector, which detects the mass of the ion by how far its path has been defl ected
by the electric fi eld. It only takes about 20 μs for the radical cations to reach the detector, but
sometimes they fragment before they get there, in which case other ions will also be
detected. These fragments will always have a lower mass than the ‘parent’ molecular ion, so
in a typical mass spectrum we are most interested in the heaviest ion we can see.
A typical EI mass spectrum looks like this:

Most molecules have all their
electrons paired; radicals have
unpaired electrons. Molecules
that carry a negative charge are
**anions; molecules with a positive**
charge are cations. Radical
**cations and radical anions are**
simply species that are both
charged and have an unpaired
electron.

This compound was identifi ed as a pheromone deposited by worker bees when feeding as a
marker to deter their colleagues from visiting the same, now depleted, nectar source. Only
minute quantities are available for analysis of course, but that doesn’t matter: mass spectrometry is successful even on a microgram scale. The spectrum you see here indicates that the
molecule has a mass of 114 because that is the highest mass observed in the spectrum: the
molecule is in fact the volatile ketone heptan-2-one.

- If you are interested in how
to use fragmentation patterns to
establish structure, you should
consult one of the specialized
textbooks in the bibliography at
the end of this chapter.



- We will not be discussing
ionization techniques in detail: it
is suffi cient for you to realize at
this stage that there are several
ways of ionizing a molecule
gently so that its mass can be
determined.


###### Mass spectrometry by chemical ionization, electrospray, or other methods

A problem with EI mass spectrometry is that, for fragile molecules, the energy of the bombarding electron can be suffi cient to cause it to fragment completely, losing all trace of the
molecular ion. Some useful information can be gained from fragmentation patterns, but in
general it is more useful to aim to weigh the molecule all in one piece. This can be achieved
using any of a number of other techniques, of which the most common are chemical ionization (CI) and electrospray (ES).
Chemical ionization is achieved by mixing a gas such as ammonia with the substrate in the
spectrometer. Bombardment of NH3 with electrons leads to formation of some NH4+ by proton
transfer, and reaction of this ion with the substrate makes a charged complex, which can be
accelerated by the electric fi eld. The masses observed by chemical ionization spectroscopy
carried out in this way are usually M + 1 or M + 18 (the mass of NH4+) relative to the mass of the
substrate. With electrospray mass spectroscopy, an aerosol of the substrate is ionized, and
ionization in the presence of sodium ions means that masses of M + 1 and M + 23 are often
seen, or, if the ionization forms anions, M – 1.
This is the electrospray mass spectrum of heptan-2-one. Notice how a single molecular ion
is clearly visible this time, but that it has a mass of 137, which is 23 more than the mass of 114
(in other words, this is the mass of M + Na[+]).

###### Mass spectrometry detects isotopes


Most elements can exist as more than one isotope. Usually, one isotope accounts for the vast
majority (perhaps >99%) of the atoms of an element. But for some elements, atoms of several
isotopes make up a signifi cant proportion of the total in a sample. Chlorine, for example, is


-----

normally a 3:1 mixture of [35]Cl and [37]Cl (hence the averaged relative atomic mass of 35.5 for
chlorine), while bromine is an almost 1:1 mixture of [79]Br and [81]Br (hence the average mass of
80 for bromine). Because mass spectrometry weighs individual molecules, there is no averaging: instead it detects the true weight of each molecule, whatever isotope it contains.
For example, the molecular ion in the EI mass spectrum of this aryl bromide has two peaks
at 186 and 188 of roughly equal intensity. Having two molecular ions of equal intensity separated by 2 mass units is indicative of bromine in a molecule.

The mass spectrum of a chlorine-containing molecule is likewise easy to identify from two
peaks separated by two mass units, but this time in a ratio of 3:1, arising from the 3:1 isotopic
ratio of [35]Cl and [37]Cl.
What happens with more than one Br or Cl? Here’s an example: the painkiller diclofenac. This
spectrum was obtained from commercial tablets, which contain the potassium salt of the active
ingredient (it becomes protonated in the acidic environment of the stomach).
The ES spectrum shows the mass of the carboxylate anion as three peaks, at 294, 296, and
298. The relative size of the peaks can be worked out from the 75% probability that each Cl
atom will be [35]Cl and the 25% probability it will be [37]Cl. The ratios are therefore

H, N, O, S, P, F, and I have only very
small amounts of isotopes other than
1H, 14N, 16O, 31P, 32S, and 128I. The real
oddity though is tin, which exists as a
mixture of 10 different stable isotopes,
the major ones being [116]Sn (15%),
117Sn (8%), 118Sn (24%), 119Sn (9%),
120Sn (33%), 122Sn (5%), and 124Sn
(6%). In reality the precise ratio of isotopes for any element varies according
to its source, a fact which can supply
useful forensic information.


###### Carbon has a minor but important isotope [13]C

The minor isotopes of many elements that appear at below the 1% level are not usually
important, but one we cannot ignore is the 1.1% of [13]C present in ordinary carbon, of which
the main isotope is of course [12]C. Another isotope, [14]C, is radioactive and used in carbon
dating, but its natural abundance is minute. The stable isotope [13]C is not radioactive, but it
is NMR active, as we shall soon see. If you look back at all the mass spectra illustrated so far
in this chapter, you will see a small peak one mass unit higher than each peak: these are
peaks arising from molecules containing [13]C instead of [12]C. The exact height of these peaks
is useful as an indication of the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. Each carbon has
a 1.1% chance of being [13]C rather than [12]C, so the more C atoms there are the bigger this
chance becomes. If there are _n carbon atoms in a molecular ion, then the ratio of M[+] to_

[M + 1][+] is 100:(1.1 × _n)._
Look at the spectrum below: it’s the fuel additive Topanol 354, whose structure and molecular formula are shown. With 15 carbons, there’s a 16.5% chance there will be one [13]C atom in
the molecule, and you can clearly see the sizeable M + 1 peak at 237. We can ignore the possibility of having two [13]C atoms as the probability is so small.

- **For any mass spectrum, always look at the heaviest peak fi rst: note whether there is chlorine**
**or bromine in the molecule, and look to check that the ratio of M[+] to [M + 1][+] is about right for**
**the number of carbons you expect.**


The reason that exact masses are
not integers lies in the slight
mass difference between a
proton (1.67262 × 10[−27] kg) and
a neutron (1.67493 × 10[−27] kg),
and in the fact that electrons
have mass (9.10956 × 10[−31] kg).


###### Atomic composition can be determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry

Ordinary mass spectra tell us the molecular weight (MW) of the molecule: we could easily see,
for example, that the bee pheromone on p. 48 had MW 114 even without knowing its structure. When we revealed it was C7H14O, we had to use other information to infer this, because
114 could also be many other things, such as C8H18 or C6H10O2 or C6H14N2. These different
atomic compositions for the same molecular weight can nonetheless be distinguished if we
know the exact molecular weight, since individual isotopes have non-integral masses (except

12C by defi nition). The table below gives these masses to fi ve decimal places, which is the sort
of accuracy you need for meaningful results. Such accurate mass measurements are obtained
by a technique called high-resolution mass spectrometry.

bromine 79Br 79 78.91835

bromine 81Br 81 80.91635

For the bee pheromone on p. 48, the accurate mass turns out to be 114.1039. The table below
compares possible atomic compositions for an approximate MW 114, and the result is conclusive. The exact masses to three places of decimals fi t the observed exact mass only for the
composition C7H14O. You may not think the fi t is very good when you look at the two numbers, but notice the difference in the error expressed as parts per million. One answer stands
out from the rest. Note that even two places of decimals would be enough to distinguish these
four compositions.

C8H18 114.140844 114.1039 369



- **In the rest of the book, whenever we state that a molecule has a certain atomic composition**
**you can assume that it has been determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry on the**
**molecular ion.**


One thing you may have noticed in the table above is that there are no entries with just one
nitrogen atom. Two nitrogen atoms, yes; one nitrogen no! This is because any complete molecule with C, H, O, S, and just one nitrogen in it has an odd molecular weight. This is because C,
O, S, and N all have even atomic weights—only H has an odd atomic weight. Nitrogen is the
only element from C, O, S, and N that can form an odd number of bonds (3). Molecules with
one nitrogen atom must have an odd number of hydrogen atoms and hence an odd molecular
weight.



- **Quick nitrogen count (for molecules containing any of the elements C, H, N, O, and S)**

- When NMR is used medically
it is usually called magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) for
fear of alarming patients wary of
all things nuclear.


###### Nuclear magnetic resonance

 What does it do?

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) allows us to detect atomic nuclei and say what sort of
environment they are in within the molecule. In a molecule such as propanol, the hydrogen
atom of the hydroxyl group is clearly different from the hydrogen atoms of its carbon
skeleton—it can be displaced by sodium metal, for example. NMR (actually [1]H, or proton,
NMR) can easily distinguish between these two sorts of hydrogens by detecting the environment the hydrogen’s nucleus fi nds itself in. Moreover, it can also distinguish between all the
other different sorts of hydrogen atoms present. Likewise, carbon (more precisely [13]C) NMR
can easily distinguish between the three different carbon atoms. NMR is extremely versatile:
it can even scan living human brains (see picture) but the principle is still the same: being able
to detect nuclei (and hence atoms) in different environments.

###### NMR uses a strong magnetic fi eld

Imagine for a moment that we were able to ‘switch off’ the earth’s magnetic fi eld. Navigation
would be made much harder since all compasses would be useless, with their needles pointing
randomly in any direction. However, as soon as we switched the magnetic fi eld back on, they
would all point north—their lowest energy state. Now if we wanted to force a needle to point
south we would have to use up energy and, of course, as soon as we let go, the needle would
return to its lowest energy state, pointing north.
In a similar way, some atomic nuclei act like tiny compass needles when placed in a magnetic fi eld and have different energy levels according to the direction in which they are
‘pointing’. (We will explain how a nucleus can ‘point’ somewhere in a moment.) A real compass needle can rotate through 360° and have an essentially infi nite number of different
energy levels, all higher in energy than the ‘ground state’ (pointing north). Fortunately,
things are simpler with an atomic nucleus: its energy levels are quantized, just like the energy
levels of an electron, which you will meet in the next chapter, and it can adopt only certain
specifi c energy levels. This is like a compass which points, say, only north or south, or maybe
only north, south, east, or west, and nothing in between. Just as a compass needle has to be
made of a magnetic material to feel the effect of the earth’s magnetism, so it is that only certain nuclei are ‘magnetic’. Many (including ‘normal’ carbon-12, [12]C) do not interact with a
magnetic fi eld at all and cannot be observed in an NMR machine. But, importantly for us in
this chapter, the minor carbon isotope [13]C does display magnetic properties, as does [1]H, the
most abundant atomic nucleus on earth. When a [13]C or [1]H atom fi nds itself in a magnetic
fi eld, it has two available energy states: it can either align itself with the fi eld (‘north’ you
could say), which would be the lowest energy state, or against the fi eld (‘south’), which is
higher in energy.

NMR instrument. The fat cylinder
is the supercooled magnet. The
device hanging over it is an
automatic sample changer and
the console in the foreground
controls the machine.


The property of a nucleus that allows magnetic interactions, i.e. the property possessed by

13C and 1H but not by 12C, is spin. If you conceive of a 13C and 1H nucleus spinning, you can
see how the nucleus can point in one direction—it is the axis of the spin that is aligned with
or against the fi eld.
Let’s return to the compass for a moment. If you want to move a compass needle away from
pointing north, you have to push it—and expend energy as you do so. If you put the compass
next to a bar magnet, the attraction towards the magnet is much greater than the attraction
towards the north pole, and the needle now points at the magnet. You also have to push much
harder if you want to move the needle. Exactly how hard it is to turn the compass needle
depends on how strong the magnetic fi eld is and also on how well the needle is magnetized—if
it is only weakly magnetized, it is much easier to turn it round and if it isn’t magnetized at all,
it is free to rotate.
Likewise, for a nucleus in a magnetic fi eld, the difference in energy between the nuclear spin
aligned with and against the applied fi eld depends on:

 - how strong the magnetic fi eld is, and

 - the magnetic properties of the nucleus itself.

The stronger the magnetic fi eld, the greater the energy difference between the two
alignments of the nucleus. Now there is an unfortunate thing about NMR: the energy difference between the nuclear spin being aligned with the magnetic fi eld and against it is
really very small—so small that we need a very, very strong magnetic fi eld to see any difference at all.

###### NMR also uses radio waves

A [1]H or [13]C nucleus in a magnetic fi eld can have two energy levels, and energy is needed to fl ip
the nucleus from the more stable state to the less stable state. But since the amount of energy
needed is so small, it can be provided by low-energy electromagnetic radiation of radio-wave
frequency. Radio waves fl ip the nucleus from the lower energy state to the higher state. Turn
off the radio pulse and the nucleus returns to the lower energy state. When it does so, the
energy comes out again, and this (a tiny pulse of radio frequency electromagnetic radiation)
is what we detect.
We can now sum up how an NMR machine works.

**1.** The sample of the unknown compound is dissolved in a suitable solvent, placed in a
narrow tube, and put inside a very strong electromagnet. To even out imperfections in


Nuclear spin is quantized and
has the symbol I. The exact
number of different energy levels
a nucleus can adopt is determined
by the value of I of the particular
isotope. The nuclear spin Ican
have various values such as 0, [1]/2,
1, [3]/2... and the number of energy
levels is given by 2I + 1. Some
examples are [1]H, I = [1]/2; [2]H (=
D), I = 1; [11]B, I = [5]/2; [12]C, I = 0.


NMR machines contain very
strong electromagnets. The
earth’s magnetic fi eld has a fi eld
strength of between 30 and 60
microtesla. A typical magnet used
in an NMR machine has a fi eld
strength of between 2 and 10
tesla, some 10[5] times stronger
than the earth’s fi eld. These magnets are dangerous and no metal
objects must be taken into the
rooms where they are: stories
abound of unwitting workmen
whose metal toolboxes have
become fi rmly attached to NMR
magnets. Even with the immensely
powerful magnets used the
energy difference is still so small
that the nuclei only have a very
small preference for the lower
energy state. Fortunately, we can
just detect this small preference.

Radio waves are very, very low in
energy. You may know—and if
not, you will need to in the
future—that the energy
associated with electromagnetic
radiation is related to its
wavelength λ by the formula:

E = hc/λ

where h and c are constants
(Planck’s constant and the speed
of light). Radio waves, whose
wavelengths are measured in
metres, are millions of times less
energetic than rays of visible light,
with wavelengths between
380 nm (violet) and 750 nm (red).



- ‘Resonance’ is a good
analogy here. If you fi nd a piano
and hold down a key to release a
single string then give the piano
lid a good thwack, you will hear
the note you are holding down,
and only that note, continuing to
sound—it resonates. The thwack
provides the piano with sound
energy of a range of frequencies,
but only sound energy with the
right frequency is absorbed and
then re-emitted by the vibrating
string. There is another chemical
use of the word resonance,
mentioned in Chapter 7, which is
much less appropriate: the two
have nothing to do with one
another.


the sample, the tube is spun very fast by a stream of air. Inside the magnetic fi eld, any
atomic nuclei with a nuclear spin now possess different energy levels, the exact
number of different energy levels depending on the value of the nuclear spin. For [1]H
and [13]C NMR there are two energy levels.

**2.** The sample is irradiated with a short pulse of radiofrequency energy. This disturbs the
equilibrium balance between the two energy levels: some nuclei absorb the energy
and are promoted to a higher energy level.

**3.** When the pulse fi nishes, the radiation given out as the nuclei fall back down to
the lower energy level is detected using what is basically a sophisticated radio
receiver.

**4.** After lots of computation, the results are displayed in the form of intensity (i.e.
number of absorptions) against frequency. Here is an example, which we shall return
to in more detail later:

###### Why do chemically distinct nuclei absorb energy at different frequencies?

In the spectrum you see above, each peak represents a different kind of carbon atom: each
one absorbs energy (or resonates—hence the term ‘nuclear magnetic resonance’) at a different frequency. But why should carbon atoms be ‘different’? We have told you two factors
that affect the energy difference (and therefore the frequency)—the magnetic fi eld strength
and what sort of nucleus is being studied. So you might expect all [13]C nuclei to resonate at
one particular frequency and all protons ([1]H) to resonate at one (different) frequency. But
they don’t.
The variation in frequency for different carbon atoms must mean that the energy jump from
‘nucleus-aligned-with’ to ‘nucleus-aligned-against’ the applied magnetic fi eld must be different
for each type of carbon atom. The reason is that the [13]C nuclei in question experience a magnetic fi eld that is not quite the same as the magnetic fi eld that we apply. Each nucleus is surrounded by electrons, and in a magnetic fi eld these will set up a tiny electric current. This
current will set up its own magnetic fi eld (rather like the magnetic fi eld set up by the electrons
of an electric current moving through a coil of wire or solenoid), which will oppose the magnetic fi eld that we apply. The electrons are said to shield the nucleus from the external magnetic
fi eld. If the electron distribution varies from [13]C atom to [13]C atom, so does the local magnetic
fi eld experienced by its nucleus, and so does the corresponding resonating frequency.

- **Changes in the distribution of electrons around a nucleus affect:**

**•** **the local magnetic fi eld that the nucleus experiences**

**•** **the frequency at which the nucleus resonates**

**•** **the chemistry of the molecule at that atom**

**This variation in frequency is known as the chemical shift. Its symbol is δδ.**


As an example, consider ethanol (right). The red carbon attached to the OH group will have
a smaller share of the electrons around it compared to the green carbon since the oxygen atom
is more electronegative and pulls electrons towards it, away from the red carbon atom.
The magnetic fi eld that the red carbon nucleus feels will therefore be slightly greater than
that felt by the green carbon, which has a greater share of the electrons, since the red carbon
is less shielded from the applied external magnetic fi eld—in other words it is deshielded.
Since the carbon attached to the oxygen feels a stronger magnetic fi eld (it is more ‘exposed’
to the fi eld as it has lost some of its electronic shielding) there will be a greater energy difference between the two alignments of its nucleus. The greater the energy difference, the
higher the resonant frequency (energy is proportional to frequency). So for ethanol we
would expect the red carbon with the OH group attached to resonate at a higher frequency
than the green carbon, and indeed this is exactly what the [13]C NMR spectrum shows.

###### The chemical shift scale


80 60 40 20 0


When you look at a real NMR spectrum you will see that the scale does not appear to be in
magnetic fi eld units, nor in frequency, nor yet even energy, units, but in ‘parts per million’
(ppm). There is a very good reason for this. The exact frequency at which the nucleus resonates depends on the external applied magnetic fi eld. This means that if the sample is run
on a machine with a different magnetic fi eld, it will resonate at a different frequency. It
would make life very diffi cult if we couldn’t say exactly where our signal was, so we say how
far it is from some reference sample, as a fraction of the operating frequency of the machine.
We know that all protons resonate at approximately the same frequency in a given magnetic
fi eld and that the exact frequency depends on what sort of chemical environment it is in,
which in turn depends on its electrons. This approximate frequency is the operating frequency of the machine and simply depends on the strength of the magnet—the stronger
the magnet, the larger the operating frequency. The precise value of the operating frequency
is simply the frequency at which a standard reference sample resonates. In everyday use,
rather than actually referring to the strength of the magnet in tesla, chemists usually just
refer to its operating frequency. A 9.4 T NMR machine is referred to as a 400 MHz spectrometer since that is the frequency in this strength fi eld at which the protons in the reference
sample resonate; other nuclei, for example [13]C, would resonate at a different frequency, but
the strength is arbitrarily quoted in terms of the proton operating frequency.

- Silicon and oxygen have
opposite effects on an adjacent
carbon atom: electropositive
silicon shields; electronegative
oxygen deshields.
Electronegativities: Si: 1.8; C: 2.5;
O: 3.5.



- Again, ignore the brown
solvent peaks at 77ppm—they
are of no interest to us at the
moment. You also need not
worry about the fact that the
signals have different intensities.
This is a consequence of the way
the spectrum was recorded and
in [13]C spectra signal intensity is
usually of no consequence.


###### The reference sample—tetramethylsilane, TMS

The compound we use as a reference sample is usually tetramethylsilane, TMS. This is silane
(SiH4) with each of the hydrogen atoms replaced by methyl groups to give Si(CH3)4. The four
carbon atoms attached to silicon are all equivalent and, because silicon is more electropositive
than carbon, they are fairly electron-rich (or _shielded), which means they resonate at a_
frequency a little less than that of most organic compounds. This is useful because it means
our reference sample is not bang in the middle of our spectrum!
The chemical shift, δ, in parts per million (ppm) of a given nucleus in our sample is defi ned
in terms of the resonance frequency as:

frequency (Hz) − frequency TMS (Hz)
δ =
frequency TMS (MHz)

No matter what the operating frequency (i.e. strength of the magnet) of the NMR machine,
the signals in a given sample (e.g. ethanol) will always occur at the same chemical shifts. In
ethanol the (red) carbon attached to the OH resonates at 57.8 ppm whilst the (green) carbon
of the methyl group resonates at 18.2 ppm. Notice that by defi nition TMS itself resonates at
0 ppm. The carbon nuclei in most organic compounds resonate at greater chemical shifts,
normally between 0 and 200 ppm.
Now, let’s return to the sample spectrum you saw on p. 54 and which is reproduced below,
and you can see the features we have discussed. This is a 100 MHz spectrum; the horizontal axis
is actually frequency but is usually quoted in ppm of the fi eld of the magnet, so each unit is one
ppm of 100 MHz, that is, 100 Hz. We can tell immediately from the three peaks at 176.8, 66.0,
and 19.9 ppm that there are three different types of carbon atom in the molecule.

###### Regions of the [13]C NMR spectrum

But we can do better than this: we can also work out what sort of chemical environment the
carbon atoms are in. All [13]C spectra can be divided into four major regions: saturated carbon
atoms (0–50 ppm), saturated carbon atoms next to oxygen (50–100 ppm), unsaturated carbon
atoms (100–150 ppm), and unsaturated carbon atoms next to oxygen, i.e. C�O groups (150 to
about 200 ppm).

The spectrum you just saw is in fact that of lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid). When you
turned the last page, you made some lactic acid from glucose in the muscles of your arm—it is
the breakdown product from glucose when you do anaerobic exercise. Each of lactic acid’s
carbon atoms gives a peak in a different region of the spectrum.
But hang on one moment, you may say—don’t we only see signals for carbon-13 nuclei and
not carbon-12, which make up most of the carbon atoms in any normal sample of lactic acid?
The answer is yes, and indeed only about 1.1% (the natural abundance of [13]C) of the C atoms
in any sample are ‘visible’ by [13]C NMR. But since those [13]C atoms will be distributed more or
less randomly through the sample, this fact does not affect any of the arguments about the
appearance of the spectrum. What it does mean, however, is that [13]C NMR is not as sensitive as

1H NMR, for example, where essentially all of the H atoms in the sample will be ‘visible’.

###### Different ways of describing chemical shift

The chemical shift scale runs to the left from zero (where TMS resonates), i.e. backwards from
the usual style. Chemical shift values around zero are obviously small but are confusingly
called ‘high fi eld’ because this is the high magnetic fi eld end of the scale. We suggest you say
‘large’ or ‘small’ chemical shift and ‘large’ or ‘small’ δ, but ‘high’ or ‘low’ fi eld to avoid confusion. Alternatively, use ‘upfi eld’ for high fi eld (small δ) and ‘downfi eld’ for low fi eld (large δ).
One helpful description we have already used is shielding. Each carbon nucleus is surrounded by electrons that shield the nucleus from the applied fi eld. Simple saturated carbon
nuclei are the most shielded: they have small chemical shifts (0–50 ppm) and resonate at high
fi eld. One electronegative oxygen atom moves the chemical shift downfi eld into the
50–100 ppm region. The nucleus has become deshielded. Unsaturated carbon atoms experience even less shielding (100–150 ppm) because of the way in which electrons are distributed
around the nucleus. If they are also bonded to oxygen (the most common unsaturated carbons bonded to oxygen are those of carbonyl groups), then the nucleus is even more deshielded
and moves to the largest chemical shifts around 200 ppm. The next diagram summarizes
these different ways of talking about NMR spectra.


If you are coming back to this
chapter after reading Chapter 4
you might like to know that
unsaturated C atoms are more
deshielded than saturated ones
because a π bond has a nodal
plane, i.e. a plane with no electron density in at all. Electrons in
π bonds are less effi cient at
shielding the nucleus than electrons in σ bonds.

###### A guided tour of the [13]C NMR spectra of some simple molecules

So, on to some real [13]C NMR spectra. Our very fi rst compound, hexanedioic acid, has the
simple NMR spectrum shown here. The fi rst question is: why only three peaks for six carbon
atoms? Because of the symmetry of the molecule, the two carboxylic acids are identical and
give one peak at 174.2 ppm. By the same token C2 and C5 are identical, and C3 and C4 are
identical. These are all in the saturated region 0–50 ppm but the carbons next to the electronwithdrawing CO2H group will be more deshielded than the others. So we assign C2/C5 to the
peak at 33.2 ppm and C3/C4 to 24.0 ppm.



- Why isn’t this compound
called ‘hexane-1,6-dioic acid’?
Well, carboxylic acids can only be
at the end of chains, so no other
hexanedioic acids are possible:
the 1 and 6 are redundant.

Heptan-2-one is the bee pheromone mentioned on p. 48. It has no symmetry so all its seven
carbon atoms are different. The carbonyl group is easy to identify (208.8 ppm) but the rest are
more diffi cult. The two carbon atoms next to the carbonyl group come at lowest fi eld, while
C7 is at highest fi eld (13.9 ppm). It is important that there is the right number of signals at
about the right chemical shift. If that is so, we are not worried if we cannot assign each frequency to a precise carbon atom (such as atoms 4, 5, and 6, for example). As we said before,
don’t be concerned with the intensities of the peaks.

You met BHT on p. 8: its formula is C15H24O and the fi rst surprise in its NMR spectrum is
that there are only seven signals for the 15 carbon atoms. There is obviously a lot of symmetry; in fact the molecule has a plane of symmetry vertically as it is drawn here, and the
coloured blobs indicate pairs or groups of carbons related to each other by symmetry which
therefore give only one signal. The very strong signal at δ = 30.4 ppm belongs to the six
identical methyl groups on the t-butyl groups (coloured red) and the other two signals in the
0–50 ppm range are the methyl group at C4 and the brown central carbons of the t-butyl
groups. In the aromatic region there are only four signals as the two halves of the molecule
are the same. As with the last example, we are not concerned with exactly which is which—
we just check that there are the right number of signals with the right chemical shifts.

Paracetamol is a familiar painkiller with a simple structure—it too is a phenol but in addition
it carries an amide substituent on the benzene ring. Its NMR spectrum contains one saturated
carbon atom at 24 ppm (the methyl group of the amide side chain), one carbonyl group at
168 ppm, and four other peaks at 115, 122, 132, and 153 ppm. These are the carbons of the
benzene ring. Why four peaks? The two halves of the benzene ring must be the same (only one
signal for each pair of carbons coloured red and green), which tells us that the NHCOCH3 group
doesn’t really lie just to one side as shown here, but rotates rapidly, meaning that on average the
two sides of the ring are indistinguishable, as in BHT. Why is one of these aromatic peaks in the
C�O region at 153 ppm? This must be C4 because it is bonded to oxygen, a reminder that
carbonyl groups are not the only unsaturated carbon atoms bonded to oxygen (see the chart
on p. 56), although it is not as deshielded as the true C�O group at 168 ppm.

###### The [1]H NMR spectrum

1H NMR (or ‘proton NMR’) spectra are recorded in the same way as 13C NMR spectra: radio
waves are used to study the energy level differences of nuclei, but this time they are [1]H and not

13C nuclei. Like 13C, 1H nuclei have a nuclear spin of 1/2 and so have two energy levels: they can
be aligned either with or against the applied magnetic fi eld. Here, as an example, is the [1]H NMR
spectrum of acetic (ethanoic) acid, MeCO2H, and below it the [13]C NMR spectrum.

1H NMR spectra have many similarities with 13C NMR spectra: the scale runs from right to left
and the zero point is given by the same reference compound, though it is the proton resonance
of Me4Si rather than the carbon resonance that defi nes the zero point. However, as you immediately see in the spectrum above, the scale is much smaller, ranging over only about 10 ppm
instead of the 200 ppm needed for carbon. This makes perfect sense: the variation in the chemical

shift is a measure of the shielding of the nucleus by the electrons around it. There is inevitably
less change possible in the distribution of two electrons around a hydrogen nucleus than in that
of the eight valence electrons around a carbon nucleus. Nonetheless the acetic acid spectrum
above shows you that, just as you would expect, the H atom of the carboxylic acid group, directly
attached to an oxygen atom, is more deshielded than the H atoms of acetic acid’s methyl group.
We can also divide up the [1]H NMR spectrum into regions that parallel the regions of the [13]C
NMR spectrum. Hydrogen atoms bonded to saturated carbon atoms appear in the right-hand,
more shielded (between 5 and 0 ppm) region of the spectrum, while those bonded to unsaturated
carbon atoms (alkenes, arenes, or carbonyl groups primarily) appear in the left-hand, less shielded
region between 10 and 5 ppm. As with the [13]C spectrum, nearby oxygen atoms withdraw electron density and make the signals appear towards the left-hand end of each of these regions.

###### Some examples of [1]H NMR spectra

You can see exactly how [1]H NMR signals fall into these regions in the following collection of spectra. The fi rst two spectra each contain only one peak because every proton in benzene and in
cyclohexane is identical. In benzene the peak is at 7.5 ppm, where we expect a proton attached to
an unsaturated C atom to lie, while in cyclohexane it is at 1.35 ppm because all the cyclohexane
protons are attached to saturated C atoms. Again, to help comparisons, we have also included the

13C spectra of benzene and cyclohexane. For benzene, the signal falls in the unsaturated C region
(100–150 ppm), at 129 ppm, while for cyclohexane it is in the saturated C region, at 27 ppm.

_tert-Butyl methyl ether is a solvent and fuel additive whose [1]H spectrum illustrates the_
effect of a nearby oxygen atom: the large peak at 1.1 ppm comes from the nine H atoms
making up three identical methyl groups of the tert-butyl part of the molecule, while the
three H atoms of the methyl part of the ether are at 3.15 ppm. These three hydrogen atoms
are all bonded directly to a C atom, which itself is bonded to O, whose electronegativity
attracts their electrons, deshielding the [1]H nuclei and shifting them to larger chemical
shift.

1H NMR has many more features, which we will leave aside for the moment, and it is no exaggeration to say it is in general more important for the routine determination of structure than
all the other methods put together. We will come back to [1]H NMR in more detail in Chapter 13.

oxygen: they are back in the 0–50 ppm region but at its low fi eld end—about 30–35 ppm—
because they are still deshielded by the nearby oxygen atom. Two of the alcohols have
carbon(s) one further away still at yet smaller chemical shift (further upfi eld, more shielded)
at about 20 ppm, but only the n-butanol has a more remote carbon still at 15.2. The number
and the chemical shift of the signals identify the molecules very clearly.
A common situation chemists fi nd themselves in is that they have some idea about a molecular formula—from high-resolution mass spectrometry, for example—and need to match a
structure to NMR data. Here’s an example: the formula C3H6O is represented by seven reasonable structures, as shown in the margin. The three [13]C NMR spectra below represent three of
these compounds. The challenge is to identify which three. We will give you some clues, and
then we suggest you try to work out the answer for yourself before turning the page.
Simple symmetry can distinguish structures A, C, and E from the rest as these three have
only two types of carbon atom. The two carbonyl compounds, D and E, will have one peak in
the 150–200 ppm region but D has two different saturated carbon atoms while E has only one.
The two alkenes, F and G, both have two unsaturated carbon atoms (100–200 ppm) but in
ether G one of them is joined to oxygen—you would expect it therefore to be deshielded and
to appear between 150 and 200 ppm.

The three saturated compounds (A, B, and C) present the greatest problem. The epoxide, B, has
two different carbon atoms next to oxygen (50–100 ppm) and one normal saturated carbon atom
(0–50 ppm). The remaining two both have one signal in the 0–50 ppm region and one in the
50–100 ppm region, and only the more powerful techniques of [1]H NMR and, to a certain extent,
infrared spectroscopy (which we will move on to shortly) will distinguish them reliably.
Here are NMR spectra of three of these molecules. Before reading further see if you can
assign them to the structures on the previous page. Try also to suggest which signals belong
to which carbon atoms.

We hope these didn’t give you too much trouble. The only carbonyl compound with two
identical carbons is acetone (E) so spectrum 1 must be that one. Notice the very low fi eld signal (206.6 ppm) typical of a simple ketone C�O carbon atom. Spectrum 2 has two unsaturated carbons and a saturated carbon next to oxygen so it must be F or G. In fact it has to be F
as both unsaturated carbons are similar (137 and 116 ppm) and neither is next to oxygen
(>150 ppm). This leaves spectrum 3, which appears to have no carbon atoms next to oxygen
as all chemical shifts are less than 50 ppm. No compound fi ts that description and the two
signals at 48.0 and 48.2 ppm are suspiciously close to the arbitrary 50 ppm borderline. They
are, of course, both next to oxygen and this is compound B.

###### Infrared spectra

 Functional groups are identifi ed by infrared spectra

13C and 1H NMR spectra tell us a lot about the hydrocarbon skeleton of a molecule, and mass
spectroscopy weighs the molecule as a whole. But none of these techniques reveal much about
functional groups. Some functional groups, for example C�O or C�C, can be seen in the [13]C
NMR spectrum because they contain carbon atoms, but many, such as ethers or nitro groups,
cannot be seen at all by NMR—they show their presence only by the way they affect the
chemical shifts of nearby H or C atoms.



- An epoxide is a threemembered cyclic ether, such as B.

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, however, provides a direct way of observing these functional
groups because it detects the stretching and bending of bonds rather than any property of the
atoms themselves. It is particularly good at detecting the stretching of unsymmetrical bonds
of the kind found in functional groups such as OH, C�O, NH2, and NO2, and for this reason
IR spectroscopy complements NMR beautifully as a method for structural analysis.

NMR requires electromagnetic waves in the radio-wave region of the spectrum to make
nuclei fl ip from one state to another. The amount of energy needed for stretching and bending individual bonds, while still very small, is rather greater, and therefore corresponds to
much shorter wavelengths. These wavelengths lie in the infrared, just to the long wavelength side of visible light (wavelengths between 10 and 100 mm). When the carbon skeleton
of a molecule vibrates, all the bonds stretch and relax in combination and by and large these
absorptions are unhelpful. However, some bonds stretch essentially independently of the
rest of the molecule, and we can use these to identify functional groups. This occurs if the
bond is either:

 - much stronger or weaker than others nearby, or

 - between atoms that are much heavier or lighter than their neighbours

Indeed, the relationship between the frequency of the bond vibration, the mass of the
atoms, and the strength of the bond is essentially the same as Hooke’s law for a simple harmonic oscillator. Hooke’s law shows that the frequency of the vibration ν is proportional to
the square root of a force constant f—more or less the bond strength—and inversely proportional to the square root of a reduced mass μ, that is, the product of the masses of the two
atoms forming the bond divided by their sum:

µ = _m m1_ 2
_m1_ + _m2_


The precise maths is less important to us as chemists than the simple result.



- **Stronger bonds vibrate faster and so do lighter atoms.**


Infrared spectra are simple absorption spectra. The sample is dissolved in a solvent (or sometimes deposited on the surface of an inert NaCl plate) and exposed to infrared radiation. The
wavelength scanned across the spectrum and the amount of infrared energy able to pass
through the sample are plotted against the wavelength of the radiation. Just to make the numbers work out nicely, IR spectra don’t usually indicate the wavelength but instead a value
known as the ‘wavenumber’, in cm[−][1], which is simply the number of wavelengths in one
centimetre. For a typical bond this will fall between 4000 (short wavelengths, i.e. high frequency) and 500 (long wavelengths, i.e. low frequency). Strong bonds, and light atoms,
vibrate fast, so you expect to see these bonds at the high wavenumber end of the spectrum,
always plotted at the left-hand end.

To illustrate what we mean, here are some typical values for the IR frequencies of a selection
of bonds grouped in two ways. Firstly, a series of bonds to increasingly heavy atoms (D, deuterium, has twice the mass of H, and Cl has about twice the mass of O) and secondly a series
of bonds of increasing strength.

Here’s what a typical IR spectrum actually looks like: notice that the wavenumber scale runs
from high to low but also that absorption maxima are shown upside down (IR spectra plot
‘transmission’)—you might say that IR spectra are upside down and back to front. If you look
carefully you will also see that the scale changes in the middle to give more space to the more
detailed right-hand half of the spectrum.

This is the spectrum of cyanoacetamide, the compound shown on the right. The overall
shape of the spectrum is characteristic of this compound, but as chemists we need to be able
to interpret the spectrum, and we can do this by dividing it up into regions, just as we did with
the NMR spectra.


###### There are four important regions of the infrared spectrum

The fi rst region, from 4000 to 2500 cm[−][1] **is the region for C–H, N–H, and O–H bond stretch-**
ing. Most of the atoms in an organic molecule (C, N, O, for example) are about the same
weight (12, 14, 16. . .). Hydrogen is an order of magnitude lighter than any of these and so it
dominates the stretching frequency by the large effect it has on the reduced mass, so any bond
to H comes right at the left-hand end of the spectrum.
Even the strongest bonds between non-H atoms—triple bonds such as C≡C or C≡N—
absorb at slightly lower frequencies than bonds to hydrogen: these are in the next region, the
**triple bond region from about 2500 to 2000 cm[−][1]. This and the other two regions of the**
spectrum follow in logical order of bond strength as the reduced masses are all about the
same: C�C and C�O double bonds appear about 2000–1500 cm[−][1] and at the right-hand end
of the spectrum come single bonds, below 1500 cm[−][1]. These regions are summarized in this
chart, which you should memorize.


###### Reduced mass and atomic mass

We introduced the idea of
reduced mass on p. 64. To illustrate the effect of H on reduced
mass, consider this: the reduced
mass of a C–C bond is
(12 × 12)/(12 + 12), i.e.
144/24 = 6.0. If we change one
of these atoms for H, the
reduced mass changes to
(12 × 1)/(12 + 1), i.e. 12/13
= 0.92, but if we change it
instead for F, the reduced mass
changes to (12 × 19)/(12 + 19),
i.e. 228/31 = 7.35. There is a
small change when we increase
the mass to 19 (F), but an enormous change when we decrease
it to 1 (H).


-----

- Absorptions in the IR are
frequently referred to as
‘peaks’—on the spectrum of
course they are ‘troughs’!


Looking back at the spectrum of cyanoacetamide on p. 65, we see peaks in the X–H region at
about 3300 and 2950 cm[−][1], which are the N–H and C–H stretches of the NH2 and CH2 groups.
The one rather weak peak in the triple bond region (2270 cm[−][1]) is the C≡N group and the strong
peak at about 1670 cm[−][1] belongs to the C�O group. We shall explain soon why some IR peaks
are stronger than others. The rest of the spectrum is in the single bond region. This region is not
normally interpreted in detail but is characteristic of the compound as a whole rather in the way
that a fi ngerprint is characteristic of an individual human being—similarly, it cannot be ‘interpreted’. It is indeed called the fi ngerprint region. The useful information from this spectrum is
the presence of the C≡N and C�O groups and the exact position of the C�O absorption.

###### The X–H region (4000–3000 cm[–1]) distinguishes C–H, N–H, and O–H bonds



- This may surprise you: you
may be used to thinking of O–H
as more reactive than CH. This
is, of course, true but, as you
will see in Chapter 5, factors
other than bond strength control
reactivity. Bond strengths will be
much more important when we
discuss radical reactions in
Chapters 35 and 39.


The reduced masses of the C–H, N–H, and O–H combinations are all about the same. Any
difference between the positions of the IR bands of these bonds must then be due to bond
strength. In practice, C–H stretches occur at around 3000 cm[−][1] (although they are of little use
in identifying compounds, it’s a rare organic compound that has _no C–H bonds), N–H_
stretches occur at about 3300 cm[−][1], and O–H stretches higher still at around 3500 cm[−][1]. We
can immediately deduce that the O–H bond is stronger than N–H, which is stronger than
C–H. IR is a good way to measure such bond strengths.

IR bands for bonds to hydrogen


aWhen not hydrogen-bonded: see below.

The form of the absorption bands resulting from X–H IR stretches are very different in these
four compounds. Have a look at the shaded portions of the following spectra:

The IR peak of an NH group looks different (spectrum 1) from that of an NH2 group (spectrum 2). A bond gives an independent vibration only if both bond strength and reduced mass
are different from those of neighbouring bonds. In the case of an isolated N–H group, this is
likely to be true and we usually get a sharp peak at about 3300 cm[−][1], whether the NH group is
part of a simple amine (R2NH) or an amide (RCONHR). The NH2 group is also independent of
the rest of the molecule, but the two NH bonds inside the NH2 group have identical force
constants and reduced masses, and so vibrate as a single unit. Two equally strong bands
appear: one for the two N–H bonds vibrating in phase (symmetric) and one for the two N–H
bonds vibrating in opposition (antisymmetric). The antisymmetric vibration requires more
energy and is at slightly higher frequency.

The O–H bands occur at higher frequency, sometimes as a sharp absorption at about
3600 cm[−][1]. More often, as in spectra 3 and 4, you will see a broad absorption at anywhere from
3500 to 2900 cm[−][1]. This is because OH groups form strong hydrogen bonds that vary in length
and strength. A sharp absorption at 3600 cm[−][1] indicates a non-hydrogen-bonded OH group;
the lower the absorption frequency the stronger the H bond.

Alcohols form hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl oxygen of one molecule and the
hydroxyl hydrogen of another. These bonds are variable in length (although they are usually
rather longer than normal covalent O–H bonds) and they slightly weaken the true covalent
O–H bonds by varying amounts. When a bond varies in length and strength it will have a
range of stretching frequencies distributed about a mean value. Alcohols, including the phenol shown in spectrum 3, typically give a rounded absorption at about 3300 cm[−][1] (contrast
the sharp shape of the N–H stretch in the same region you see in the spectra above). Carboxylic
acids (RCO2H) form hydrogen-bonded dimers with two strong H bonds between the carbonyl
oxygen atom of one molecule and the acidic hydrogen of the other. These also vary considerably in length and strength, and usually give the very broad V-shaped absorbance you see in
the benzoic acid spectrum 4.

The spectra of paracetamol and BHT (which you met on pp. 58–59) illustrate the effect of
hydrogen bonding on peak shape. Paracetamol has a typical sharp peak at 3330 cm[−][1] for the
N–H stretch and then a rounded absorption for the hydrogen-bonded O–H stretch from 3300
down to 3000 cm[−][1] in the gap between the N–H and C–H stretches. By contrast, BHT has a
sharp absorption at 3600 cm[−][1] as the two large t-butyl groups prevent the typical hydrogen
bond from forming.

You may be confused the fi rst time you see the IR spectrum of a terminal alkyne, R–C≡C–H,
because you will see a strongish sharp peak at around 3300 cm[−][1] that looks just like an N–H
stretch—the spectrum below (of methyl propynoate, also known as methyl propiolate)
illustrates this. The displacement of this peak from the usual C–H stretch at about 3000 cm[−][1]


-----

cannot be due to a change in the reduced mass and must be due to a marked increase in bond
strength. The alkyne C–H bond is shorter and stronger than alkane C–H bonds.

100%



- In Chapter 4 you will see
that carbon uses an sp[3] orbital
to make a C–H bond in a
saturated structure but has to
use an sp orbital for a terminal
alkyne C–H. This orbital has
one-half s character instead of
one-quarter s character. The
electrons in an s orbital are held
closer to the carbon’s nucleus
than in a p orbital, so the sp
orbital makes for a shorter,
stronger C–H bond.

###### The triple bond region (3000–2000 cm[−][1])

This region is often empty, meaning that when you do see a peak between 2000 and 2500 you
can be absolutely certain that the compound is an alkyne (usually at around 2100) or a nitrile
(at 2250 cm[−][1]). There are examples above and on p. 65.


-----

###### The double bond region is the most important in IR spectra

The most important absorptions in the double bond region are those of the carbonyl (C�O),
alkene or arene (C�C), and nitro (NO2), groups. All give rise to sharp bands, C�O gives one
strong (i.e. intense) band anywhere between 1900 and 1500 cm[−][1]; alkene C�C gives one weak
band at about 1640 cm[−][1], and NO2 gives two strong (intense) bands in the mid-1500s and mid1300s cm[−][1]. Arenes usually give two or three bands in the region 1600–1500 cm[−][1]. We can
illustrate several of these features in the spectrum shown below, which is that of 4-nitrocinnamaldehyde, shown in the margin.

Why the nitro group gives two bands is easily understood. Just as with OH and NH2, it is a
matter of how many identical bonds are present in the same functional group. Carbonyl and
alkene clearly have one double bond each. The nitro group at fi rst sight appears to contain two
different groups, N[+]–O[−] and N�O, but delocalization means they are identical and we see
absorption for symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations. As with NH2, more energy
is associated with the antisymmetric vibration and it occurs at higher frequency (>1500 cm[−][1]).

Arenes, being rings, have a much more complex pattern of vibration that cannot be analysed simply, However, it’s worth noting that arene C�C bonds come at lower frequency
(<1600 cm[−][1]) than alkene C�C bonds (>1600 cm[−][1]). Why? Well the individual C–C bonds in
benzene are of course not full C�C double bonds—all six bonds are the same, and have the
averaged character of one-and-a-half bonds each. Not surprisingly, the absorptions of these
bonds fall right on the boundary between the single and double bond regions.
You’ve already seen the IR spectra of the three carbonyl compounds below in this chapter.
It’s easy to identify the C�O peak in each spectrum—C�O peaks are always intense (you will
see why in a minute) and come somewhere near 1700 cm[−][1].

###### The strength of an IR absorption depends on dipole moment

If you look back at the X–H regions (3000–4000 cm[−][1]) of the four spectra on pp. 66–67.
you’ll notice something that at fi rst sight seems odd. The N–H and O–H absorptions are
stronger than the C–H absorptions at 3000 cm[−][1], despite there being more C–H bonds in
these molecules than O–H or N–H bonds. The reason for this is that the strength of an IR
absorption varies with the change of dipole moment (see the box below for a defi nition)
when the bond is stretched. If the bond is perfectly symmetrical, there is no change in
dipole moment and there is no IR absorption. Obviously, the C�C bond is less polar than
either C�O or N�O and its absorption is less intense in the IR. Indeed it may be absent
altogether in a symmetrical alkene. By contrast the carbonyl group is very polarized, with
oxygen attracting the electrons away from carbon, and stretching it causes a large change
in dipole moment. C�O stretches are usually the strongest peaks in the IR spectrum. O–H
and N–H stretches are stronger than C–H stretches because C–H bonds are only weakly
polarized.



- Contrast the term ‘strength’
applied to absorption and to
bonds. A stronger absorption is
a more intense absorption. A
strong bond on the other hand
has a higher frequency of
absorption (other things
being equal).


###### Dipole moments

Dipole moment depends on the variation in distribution of electrons along the bond and also its length, which is why
stretching a bond can change its dipole moment. For bonds between unlike atoms, the larger the difference in electronegativity, the greater the dipole moment and the more it changes when stretched. For identical atoms (C�C, for
example) the dipole moment, and its capacity to change with stretching, is much smaller. Stretching frequencies for
symmetrical molecules can be measured using an alternative method known as Raman spectroscopy. This is an
IR-based technique using scattered light that relies on the polarizability of bonds. Raman spectra are outside the scope
of this book.


This is a good point to remind you of the various deductions we have made so far about IR
spectra.



- **Absorptions in IR spectra**

Position of band reduced mass of atoms light atoms give high frequency

Strength (intensity) of band change in dipole large dipole moment gives strong

Width of band depends on: hydrogen bonding strong H bond gives broad peak

- A matching fi ngerprint is
used to link a suspect to a
crime, but you can’t interpret a
fi ngerprint to deduce the height,
weight, or eye-colour of a
criminal. Likewise with the
fi ngerprint region: a matching
fi ngerprint confi rms that two
compounds are identical, but
without a ‘suspect’ you have to
rely on the rest of the spectrum,
above 1500 cm[−1], for analysis.


###### The single bond region is used as a molecular fi ngerprint

The region below 1500 cm[−][1] is where the single bond vibrations occur. Here our hope that
individual bonds may vibrate independently of the rest of the molecule is usually doomed to
disappointment. The atoms C, N, and O all have about the same atomic weight and C–C,
C–N, and C–O single bonds all have about the same strength.

Single bonds

Pair of atoms Reduced mass Bond strength

C–C 6.0 350 kJ mol[−][1]

C–N 6.5 305 kJ mol[−][1]

C–O 6.9 360 kJ mol[−][1]

In addition, C–C bonds are often joined to other C–C bonds with virtually identical
strength and reduced mass, and they have essentially no dipole moments. The only one of
these single bonds of any value is C–O, which is polar enough to show up as a strong
absorption at about 1100 cm[−][1]. Some other single bonds, such as C–Cl (weak and with a
large reduced mass, so appearing at low frequency), are quite useful at about 700 cm[−][1].
Otherwise the single bond region is usually crowded with hundreds of absorptions from
vibrations of all kinds used as a ‘fi ngerprint’ characteristic of the molecule but not really
open to interpretation.
Among those hundreds of peaks in the fi ngerprint region there are some of a quite different kind. Stretching is not the only bond movement that leads to IR absorption. Bending of
bonds, particularly C–H and N–H bonds, also leads to quite strong peaks. These are called
_deformations. Bending a bond is easier than stretching it (which is easier, stretching or bend-_
ing an iron bar?). Consequently, bending absorptions need less energy and come at lower
frequencies than stretching absorptions for the same bonds. These bands may not often be
useful in identifying molecules, but you will notice them as they are often strong (they are
usually stronger than C�C stretches, for example) and may wonder what they are.

###### Mass spectra, NMR, and IR combined make quick identifi cation possible

If these methods are each as powerful as we have seen on their own, how much more effective
they must be together! We shall fi nish this chapter with the identifi cation of some simple
unknown compounds using all three methods. The fi rst is an industrial emulsifi er used to
blend solids and liquids into smooth pastes. Its elecrospray mass spectrum shows it has M + H
with a mass of 90, so an odd molecular weight (89) suggests one nitrogen atom. High-resolution
mass spectrometry reveals that the formula is C4H11NO.

The [13]C NMR spectrum has only three peaks so two of the carbon atoms must be the same.
There is one signal for saturated carbon next to oxygen, and two for other saturated carbons,
one more downfi eld than the other.

The IR spectrum reveals a broad peak for an OH group with two sharp NH2 peaks just
protruding. If we put this together, we know we have C–OH and C–NH2. Neither of these
carbons can be duplicated (as there is only one O and only one N) so it must be the other two
C atoms that are the same.

The next stage is one often overlooked. We don’t seem to have much information, but try
and put the two fragments together, knowing the molecular formula, and there’s very little
choice. The carbon chain (shown in red) could either be linear or branched and that’s it!

There is no room for double bonds or rings because we need to fi t in the 11 hydrogen
atoms. We cannot put N or O in the chain because we know from the IR that we have the
groups OH and NH2, which can each be joined only to one other group. Of the seven possibilities only the last two, A and B, are possible since they alone have two identical carbon
atoms (the two methyl groups in each case); all the other structures would have four separate
signals in the NMR.
So, how can we choose between these? The solution is in the [1]H NMR spectrum, which is
shown below. There are only two peaks visible: one at 3.3 and one at 1.1 ppm. It’s quite common in [1]H NMR spectra not to see signals for protons attached to O or N (you will see why in
Chapter 13) so we can again rule out all structures with more than two different types of H
attached to C. Again, we are left with A and B, confi rming our earlier deductions. But the
chemical shift of the signal at δ 3.3 tells us more: it has to be due to H atoms next to an oxygen
atom because it is deshielded. The industrial emulsifi er must therefore be A: 2-amino-2methylpropan-1-ol.

###### Double bond equivalents help in the search for a structure

The last example was fully saturated but it is usually a help in deducing the structure of an
unknown compound if, once you know the atomic composition, you immediately work out
how much unsaturation there is. It may seem obvious to you that, as C4H11NO has no double
bonds, then C4H9NO (losing two hydrogen atoms) must have one double bond, C4H7NO two
double bonds, and so on. Well, it’s not quite as simple as that. Some possible structures for
these formulae are shown below.

Some of these structures have the right number of double bonds (C�C and C�O), one
has a triple bond, and three compounds use rings as an alternative way of ‘losing’ some
hydrogen atoms. Each time you make a ring or a double bond, you have to lose two more
hydrogen atoms. So double bonds (of all kinds) and rings are called double bond equiva**lents (DBEs).**
You can work out how many DBEs there are in a given atomic composition just by making
a drawing of one possible structure for the formula (all possible structures for the same formula have the same number of DBEs). Alternatively, you can calculate the DBEs if you wish.
A saturated hydrocarbon with n carbon atoms has (2n + 2) hydrogens. Oxygen doesn’t make
any difference to this: there are the same number of Hs in a saturated ether or alcohol as in a
saturated hydrocarbon.

saturated hydrocarbon C7H16 saturated alcohol C7H16O saturated ether C7H16O
All have

**OH**

(2n + 2)

**O** H atoms


So, for a compound containing C, H, and O only, take the actual number of hydrogen atoms
away from (2n + 2) and divide by two. Just to check that it works, for the unsaturated ketone
C7H12O the calculation becomes:

**1.** Maximum number of H atoms for 7Cs: 2n + 2 = 16

**2.** Subtract the actual number of H atoms (12): 16 – 12 = 4

**3.** Divide by 2 to give the DBEs: 4/2 = 2

Here are two more examples to illustrate the method. This unsaturated cyclic acid has:
16 – 10 = 6 divided by 2 = 3 DBEs and it has one alkene, one C�O, and one ring. Correct.
The aromatic ether has 16 – 8 = 8 divided by 2 gives 4 DBEs and it has three double bonds in
the ring and the ring itself. Correct again. A benzene ring always gives four DBEs: three for the
double bonds and one for the ring.
Nitrogen makes a difference. Every nitrogen adds one extra hydrogen atom because nitrogen
can make three bonds. This means that the formula becomes: subtract actual number of
hydrogens from (2n + 2), add one for each nitrogen atom, and divide by two. We can try this out
too. Here are some example structures of compounds with seven C atoms, one N and an
assortment of unsaturation and rings.

**CO2H**

**OMe**


16 – 10 = 6 divided by 2 = 3 DBEs and it has one alkene, one C�O, and one ring. Correct. C7H10O2

= three DBE

The aromatic ether has 16 – 8 = 8 divided by 2 gives 4 DBEs and it has three double bonds in
the ring and the ring itself. Correct again. A benzene ring always gives four DBEs: three for the
double bonds and one for the ring. **OMe**
Nitrogen makes a difference. Every nitrogen adds one extra hydrogen atom because nitrogen C7H8O
can make three bonds. This means that the formula becomes: subtract actual number of = four DBE
hydrogens from (2n + 2), add one for each nitrogen atom, and divide by two. We can try this out
too. Here are some example structures of compounds with seven C atoms, one N and an
assortment of unsaturation and rings.

**N**

C7H17N = (2n + 3) H atoms C7H15NO2 = one DBE C7H13NO = two DBE C7H9N = four DBE C7H10N2 = four DBE

The saturated compound has (2n + 3) Hs instead of (2n + 2). The saturated nitro compound
has (2n + 2) = 16, less 15 (the actual number of Hs) plus one (the number of nitrogen atoms) = 2.


-----

- Do not confuse this
calculation with the observation
we made about mass spectra
that the molecular weight of a
compound containing one
nitrogen atom must be odd. This
observation and the number of
DBEs are, of course, related but
they are different calculations
made for different purposes.


Divide this by 2 and you get 1 DBE, which is the N�O bond. We leave the third and fourth
examples for you to work out, but the last compound (we shall meet this later as DMAP) has:

**1.** Maximum number of H atoms for 7Cs: 2n + 2 = 16


**4.** Divide by 2 to give the DBEs: 8/2 = 4

There are indeed three double bonds and a ring, making four in all. Make sure that you can
do these calculations without much trouble.
If you have other elements too it is simpler just to draw a trial structure and fi nd out how
many DBEs there are. You may prefer this method for all compounds as it has the advantage
of giving you one possible structure before you really start. One good tip is that if you have
few hydrogens relative to the number of carbon atoms (at least four DBEs) then there is probably an aromatic ring in the compound.
Knowing the number of double bond equivalents for a formula derived by high-resolution
mass spectrometry is a quick short cut to generating some plausible structures. You can then
rule them in or rule them out by comparing with IR and NMR data.


**2.** Subtract the actual number of H atoms (10): 16 – 10 = 6

**3.** Add number of nitrogens: 6 + 2 = 8



- **Working out the DBEs for an unknown compound**

**1** **Calculate the expected number of Hs in the saturated structure**


**(a) For Cn there would be 2n + 2H atoms if C, H, O only.**


**(b) For CnNm there would be 2n + 2 + mH atoms.**

**2** **Subtract the actual number of Hs and divide by 2. This gives the DBEs.**


**3** **If there are other atoms (Cl, B, P, etc.) it is best to draw a trial structure.**

**4** **A DBE indicates either a ring or a double bond (a triple bond is two DBEs).**


**5** **A benzene ring has four DBEs (three for the double bonds and one for the ring).**

###### An unknown compound from a chemical reaction

Our last example addresses a situation very common in chemistry—working out the structure
of a product of a reaction. The situation is this: you have treated propenal (acrolein) with HBr
in ethane-1,2-diol (or glycol) as solvent for 1 hour at room temperature. Distillation of the
reaction mixture gives a colourless liquid, compound X. What is it?

The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion (181) much heavier than that of the starting
material, C3H4O = 56. Indeed it shows two molecular ions at 181 and 179, typical of a bromo
compound, so it looks as if HBr has added to the aldehyde somehow. High resolution mass
spectrometry reveals a formula of C5H9BrO2, and the fi ve carbon atoms make it look as though
the glycol has added in too. If we add everything together we fi nd that the unknown compound is the result of the three reagents added together less one molecule of water.



- It’s often very helpful, when
you have an unknown product,
to subtract the molecular mass
of the starting material from its
molecular mass to fi nd out what
has been added (or taken away).

Now, how many DBEs have we got? With a formula like this the safest bet is to draw something that has the right formula—it need not be what you expect the product to be. Here’s something in the margin—we just added atoms till we got there, and to do so we had to put in one
double bond. C5H9BrO2 has one DBE.
The next thing is to see what remains of the hydrocarbon skeleton of propenal by NMR. The

13C NMR spectrum of CH2�CH–CHO clearly shows one carbonyl group and two carbons on
a double bond. These have all disappeared in the product and for the fi ve carbon atoms we are
left with four signals, two saturated, one next to oxygen, and one at 102.6 ppm, just creeping
into the double bond region.

The IR spectrum gives us another puzzle—there appear to be no functional groups at all! No
OH, no carbonyl, no alkene—what else can we have? The answer is an ether, or rather two
ethers as there are two oxygen atoms. Now that we suspect an ether, we can look for the C–O
single bond stretch in the IR spectrum and fi nd it at 1128 cm[−][1].

###### Further reading


Each ether oxygen must have a carbon atom on each side of it, but we seem to have only one
carbon in the saturated C next to O region (50–100 ppm) in the [13]C NMR. Of course, as you’ve
already seen, these limits are arbitrary, and in fact the peak at 102 ppm is also a saturated C
next to O. It is unlikely to be an alkene anyway as it takes two carbons to make an alkene.
What would deshield a saturated C as much as this? The answer is two oxygen atoms. We can
explain the [13]C spectrum if we assume a symmetrical fragment C–O–C–O–C accounts for
three of the fi ve carbon atoms.
So, where is our double bond equivalent? We know we haven’t got a double bond (no alkene
and no C�O) so the DBE must be a ring. You might feel uncomfortable with rings, but you
must get used to them. Five-, six-, and seven-membered rings are very common. In fact, most
known organic compounds have rings in them. We could draw many cyclic structures for the
formula we have here, such as this one in the margin.
But this won’t do as it would have fi ve different carbon atoms. It is much more likely that
the basic skeletons of the organic reagents are preserved, that is, that we have a two-carbon
(from the ethylene glycol) and a three-carbon (from the propenal) fragment joined through
oxygen atoms. This gives four possibilities, all containing the C–O–C–O–C fragment we
deduced earlier (highlighted in black).

These are all quite reasonable, although we might prefer the third as it is easier to see how
it derives from the reagents. The product is in fact this third possibility, and to be sure we
would have to turn to the fi ne details of [1]H NMR spectroscopy, which we return to in
Chapter 13.

###### Looking forward to Chapters 13 and 18

We have only begun to explore the intricate world of identifi cation of structure by spectroscopy. It is important that you recognize that structures are assigned, not because of some
theoretical reason or because a reaction ‘ought’ to give a certain product, but because of sound
evidence from spectra. You have seen four powerful methods—mass spectra, [13]C and [1]H NMR,
and IR spectroscopy—in this chapter. In Chapter 13 we delve more deeply into the most
important of all ([1]H NMR) and, fi nally, in Chapter 18 we shall take each of these methods a
little further and show how the structures of more complex unknown compounds are really
deduced. The last problem we have discussed here is not really solvable without [1]H NMR and
in reality no-one would tackle any structure problem without this most powerful of all techniques. From now on spectroscopic evidence will appear in virtually every chapter. Even if we
do not say so explicitly every time a new compound appears, the structure of this compound
will in fact have been determined spectroscopically. Chemists make new compounds, and
every time they do they characterize the compound with a full set of spectra. No scientifi c
journal will accept that a new compound has been made unless a full description of all of
these spectra are submitted with the report. Spectroscopy lets the science of organic chemistry advance.


You will fi nd it an advantage to have one of the short books on
spectroscopic analysis to hand as they give explanations, comprehensive tables of data, and problems. We recommend Spectroscopic

###### Introduction

You may recognize the model
above as DNA, the molecule
that carries the genetic instructions for making all life on
earth. The helical shape of
DNA was discovered in 1953,
and the detailed arrangement
of atoms in the DNA molecule
determines whether it is a recipe for an ant, an antelope, an
antirrhinum, or anthrax.
You may also have recognized this molecule as buckminsterfullerene, a soccer-ball shaped allotrope of carbon. Buckminsterfullerene, named after the architect of the geodesic dome (which
it resembles), was fi rst identifi ed in 1985 and earned its discoverers the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1996.

Now, our question is this: how did you recognize these two compounds? You recognized
their shapes. Molecules are not simply a jumble of atoms: they are atoms held together in a
defi ned three-dimensional shape. A compound’s properties are determined not only by the
atoms it contains, but also by the spatial arrangement of these atoms. Graphite and diamond—
the two other allotropes of carbon—are both composed only of carbon atoms and yet their
properties, both chemical and physical, are completely different because those carbon atoms
are arranged very differently. Graphite has carbon atoms arranged in sheets of hexagons;
diamond has them arranged in a tetrahedral array.

Graphite Diamond

We know what shapes molecules have because we can see them—not literally of course, but
by methods such as atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM reveals the shape of pentacene, the
molecule we would usually draw as the structure below, to be as shown on the left. This is the
closest we can get to actually ‘seeing’ the atoms themselves.

pentacene

Most analytical techniques reveal the shapes of molecules less directly. X-ray diffraction
gives information about the arrangement of atoms in space, while the other spectroscopic
methods you met in Chapter 3 reveal details of the composition of molecules (mass spectroscopy) or the connectivity of the atoms they contain (NMR and IR).
From methods such as these, we know what shapes molecules have. This is why we urged
you in Chapter 2 to make your drawings of molecules realistic—we can do this because we
know what is realistic and what isn’t. But now we need to tackle the question of why molecules
have the shapes they do. What is it about the properties of their constituent atoms which
dictates those shapes? We will fi nd that the answer not only allows us to explain and predict
structure, but also allows us to explain and predict reactivity (which forms the topic of
Chapter 5).
First of all, we need to consider why atoms form molecules at all. Some atoms (helium, for
example) do so only with extreme reluctance, but the vast majority of atoms in the periodic
table are much more stable in molecules than as free atoms. Here, for example, is methane:
four hydrogen atoms arranged around a carbon in the shape of a tetrahedron.

Molecules hold together because positively charged atomic nuclei are attracted to negatively
charged electrons, and this fact allows electrons to act as ‘glue’ between the nuclei. The C and
H nuclei of methane are of course positively charged, but the ten electrons (a total of six from
C, four from the H atoms) bind those positive charges into a molecular structure. Ammonia
(NH3) and water (H2O) also have ten electrons in total, and we know that their molecular
shapes are in fact just like that of methane, but with one or two hydrogen atoms removed.

- You met the idea of using
energy to move from a lower
state to a higher state, and the
re-emission of that energy, in the
context of NMR in Chapter 3.
Here we are talking about much
larger differences in energy, and
consequently much shorter
wavelengths of emitted light.


Two elements, caesium and
rubidium, were discovered by
Robert Bunsen in 1860 and
1861 after studying atomic emission spectra of this type. They are
named after the presence of a
pair of brightly coloured lines in
their spectra—caesium from the
Latin caesius meaning bluish
grey and rubidium from the Latin
rubidus meaning red.


This tells us something important: it is the number of electrons which determines the shape
of a molecule, and not just the number of atoms (or atomic nuclei). But what determines how
electrons are arranged? Why do ten electrons give rise to a tetrahedron, for example?
Before we can answer this question, we need to simplify our discussion a bit and think about
electrons not in molecules but in individual atoms. We can then approximate the electronic
structure of molecules by considering how the component atoms combine. It is important to
remember throughout this chapter, however, that molecules are only very rarely ‘made’
directly by joining atoms together. What we are going to present is an analysis of the structure
of molecules, not a discussion of ways to build them (to which we will devote much of the later
part of this book). Much of what we will cover was worked out in the decades around 1900,
and it all came from experimental observation. Quantum theory explains the details, and you
can read much more about it in a textbook of physical chemistry. Our aim here is to give you
enough of an understanding of the theory to be able to use sound principles to predict and
explain the structure of organic molecules.
So, fi rst, some evidence.

###### Atomic emission spectra

Many towns and streets are lit at night by sodium vapour lamps, which emit an intense, pure
yellow-orange glow. Inside these lights is sodium metal. When the light is switched on, the
sodium metal is slowly vaporized. As an electric current is passed through the sodium vapour,
an orange light is emitted—the same colour as the light you get when you put a small amount
of a sodium compound on a spatula and place it in a Bunsen fl ame. Given suffi cient energy
(from the electric current or from a fl ame) sodium always emits this same wavelength of light,
and it does so because of the way the electrons are arranged in a sodium atom. The energy
supplied causes an electron to move from a lower energy state to a higher energy, or excited,
state, and as it drops down again light is emitted. The process is a bit like a weight-lifter lifting
a heavy weight—he can hold it above his head with straight arms (the excited state) but sooner
or later he will drop it and the weight will fall to the ground, releasing energy with a crash, if
not a broken toe. This is the origin of the lines in the atomic spectra not only for sodium but
for all the elements. The fl ame or the electric discharge provides the energy to promote an
electron to a higher energy level and, when this electron returns to its ground state, this
energy is released in the form of light.
If you refract the orange sodium light through a prism, you see a series of very sharp lines,
with two particularly bright ones in the orange region of the spectrum at around 600 nm.
Other elements produce similar spectra—even hydrogen, and since a hydrogen atom is the
simplest atom of all, we shall look at the atomic spectrum of hydrogen fi rst.

###### Electrons have quantized energy levels

The absorption spectrum for hydrogen was fi rst measured in 1885 by a Swiss schoolmaster,
Johann Balmer, who also noticed that the wavelengths of the lines in this spectrum could be
predicted using a mathematical formula. You do not need to know the details of his formula
at this stage, instead let’s think about the implications of the observation that a hydrogen
atom, with just one electron, has a spectrum of discrete lines at precise wavelengths. It means



- You can fi nd details of
Balmer’s formula in a textbook
of physical chemistry.


-----

that the electron can only occupy energy levels with precisely determined values, in other
words that the energy of an electron orbiting a proton (a hydrogen nucleus) is quantized. The
electron can have only certain amounts of energy, and therefore the gaps between these
energy levels (which give rise to the spectrum) likewise can only have certain well-defi ned
values. Think of climbing a fl ight of stairs—you can jump up one, two, fi ve, or even all the
steps if you are energetic enough, but you cannot climb up half or two-thirds of a step.
Likewise coming down, you can jump from one step to any other—lots of different combinations are possible but there is a fi nite number, depending on the number of steps.
We mentioned an electron ‘orbiting’ a hydrogen nucleus in the last paragraph deliberately,
because that is one way of thinking about an atom—as a miniature (10[−][23] scale!) solar system
with the nucleus as the sun and the electrons as planets. This model breaks down when we
look at it in detail (as we shall see shortly), but for the moment we can use it to think about
why electrons must exist in quantized energy levels.
To do this, we need to introduce a concept from nineteenth century physics—the experimentally observable fact that particles such as photons and electrons can also have the character of a wave as well as a particle. It’s not obvious why the energy of a particle should be
quantized, but it makes sense if you allow yourself to think of an electron as a wave.
Imagine a taut string—a piano wire or guitar string, for example—fi xed at either end. You
may well know that such a string has a fundamental frequency: if you make it vibrate by hitting or plucking it, it will vibrate in a way represented in the diagram on the right.
This diagram shows a snapshot of the string; we could also represent a ‘blurred’ image of all
the places you might fi nd the string as it vibrates, such as you would get if you took a picture
with a slow shutter speed.
But this is not the only way the string can vibrate. An alternative possibility is shown on the
right, where not only are the ends of the string stationary, but so is the point—known as a
‘node’—right in the middle. The wavelength of the vibration in this string is half that of the
one above, so the frequency is double. Musically this vibration will sound an octave higher
and is known as the fi rst harmonic of the fi rst vibration we showed you, the fundamental.
Third and fourth possibilities for ‘allowed’ vibrations are shown below, and again these correspond musically to further harmonics of the fundamental frequency.
Even if you have not met this idea in music or physics before, we hope that you can see that
the vibrating string has no choice but to adopt one of these quantized frequencies—the frequency can take on only certain values because the fi xed ends to the string means the wavelength has to be an exact divisor of the length of the string. And as we have seen before,
frequencies are directly linked to energies: the energy levels of a vibrating string are quantized.
If you think of an electron as a wave, it becomes much easier to see why it can have only
certain energy values. If you think of an electron orbiting a nucleus as a string looped back on
itself, you can visualize from the diagrams below why only certain wavelengths are possible.
These wavelengths have associated frequencies and the frequencies have associated energies:
we have a plausible explanation for the quantization of the energy of an electron.

The popular image of an atom as a miniature solar system, with the electrons behaving like
planets orbiting a star—the nucleus—works in some situations, but we are going to have to
leave it behind. The problem with this view of the atoms is that electrons can never be precisely located, and instead must be thought of as ‘smeared out’ over the space available to
them. The reason for this derives from Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, which you can
read about in any book on quantum physics. The Uncertainty Principle tells us that we can
never know exactly both the location and the momentum of any particle. If we know the
energy of an electron (and with quantized energy levels we do), we know its momentum and
therefore we cannot know exactly where it is.
As a consequence, we have to think of electrons in atoms (and in molecules) as having a prob**ability of being in a certain place at a certain time, and the sum of all these probabilities gives a**
smeared out picture of the electron’s habits, a bit like blurred pictures of the vibrating strings.
Because an electron is free to move around an atom in three dimensions, not just two, the allowed


-----

‘vibrations’ it can adopt are also three dimensional and are known as orbitals, or (because we are
just considering electrons in a single atom for now) atomic orbitals. The shapes of these orbitals
are determined by mathematical functions known as wavefunctions. The smeared out picture
of the simple atomic orbital—the lowest energy state of an electron in a hydrogen atom—looks
something like the picture on the left below. We have used shading to indicate the probability of
fi nding an electron at any one point, but a more convenient way to represent an orbital is to draw
a line (in reality a three-dimensional surface) encompassing the space where an electron spends,
say, 95% of its time. This gives something like the picture on the right. This simplest possible
orbital—the fundamental orbital of the H atom—is spherical, and is known as a **1s orbital.**
Higher energy atomic orbitals have different shapes, as you will see soon.

It’s useful to think of the atomic orbitals as a series of possible energy values for an electron,
and to think of them as ‘occupied’ if there is an electron (or, as we shall see below, two electrons) at that energy level, and ‘unoccupied’ if there isn’t. In a hydrogen atom in its most stable
state, there is only one electron, occupying the lowest energy 1s orbital. So our picture of the
1s orbital makes a good picture of what an H atom looks like too. We can also represent the 1s
orbital as an energy level, and the electron which occupies it as a little arrow (which we will
explain in a moment).

This is known as the Pauli

What happens if you put more than one electron into the orbitals around an atom?
Well, for reasons we can’t go into here, each orbital can hold two electrons—and only two,
never any more. If you add an electron to the H atom, you get the hydride anion, H[−], which
has two electrons around an H nucleus (a proton). Both of the electrons occupy the same
spherical 1s orbital.

nuclei in the context of NMR
(p. 53). Electron spin is
analogous, but different—you
can’t observe electrons by NMR,
for example, and instead they
can be observed by a technique
known as electron spin
resonance or ESR.


energy level
diagram

We can also represent the orbital occupancy as an energy level (the horizontal line) occupied by two electrons (the arrows). Why do we draw the electrons as arrows? Well, electrons
have the property of spin, and the two electrons allowed in each orbital have to spin in opposite directions. The arrows are a reminder of these opposing spins.


-----

The same is true for the helium atom: its two electrons occupy the same orbital. However,
the energy of that orbital (and all of the other possible orbitals) will be different from the
orbital for hydrogen because it has double the nuclear charge of hydrogen and the electrons
are more strongly attracted to the nucleus. We can represent the orbital occupancy like this,
with the energy level lower than the one for H because of this stronger attraction.

So far, so good. Now, lithium. The lowest energy 1s orbital around the Li nucleus can contain
two electrons, but two only, so the third electron has to go into a higher energy orbital—one
of the energy levels whose existence was inferred from atomic absorption spectroscopy. You
can think of this orbital as the three-dimensional equivalent of the fi rst harmonic of the guitar string. Like the vibration of the string, this next orbital has a node. On the string the node
was the point where no motion was observed. In an atom, a node is a point where the electron
can never be found—a void separating the two parts of the orbital. For the orbital containing
the third electron of the Li atom, this node is spherical—it divides the orbital into two parts
which nestle one within another like the layers of an onion or the stone inside a peach. We
call this orbital the 2s orbital—’2’ because we have moved up to an orbital with a node (like
the fi rst harmonic) and ‘s’ because the orbital is still spherical. The ‘s’ did not originally stand
for ‘spherical’, but as all ‘s’ orbitals are spherical it’s fi ne to remember it that way.

In a lithium atom the 1s orbital, close to the nucleus, is occupied by two electrons, while the
2s orbital, further from the nucleus, contains one. In beryllium, there is a second electron in
the 2s orbital. As before the energy levels will change as the nuclear charge increases, so the
orbital occupancy in Li and Be can be represented as shown below.

When we get to boron, something a little different happens. It turns out that for an orbital
with one node (such as the 2s orbital), the node does not have to be spherical. The node can


-----

alternatively be a plane. This alternative arrangement for an orbital with a single planar node
gives us a new type of orbital, the 2p orbital. A 2p orbital looks something like the picture on
the left below, in ‘smeared out’ form. It is often represented as the propeller shape in the middle, and it is conventionally drawn as the shape shown in the diagram to the right.

only half of the picture of the
p orbital on the right has been
fi lled in.

Unlike the 1s or 2s orbitals, the 2p orbital is directional—it points along an axis, and in
three dimensions there are three possible orientations for the axis, each of which gives rise to
a new 2p orbital (which we can call 2px, 2py and 2pz if we need to).

This is known as Hund’s rule. An
atom adopts the electronic
confi guration that has the
greatest number of unpaired
electrons in degenerate orbitals.
Whilst this is all a bit theoretical
in that isolated atoms are not
found very often, the same rule
applies to electrons in degenerate orbitals in molecules, as you
will see soon.


The planar node of the three 2p orbitals gives them just slightly more energy than a 2s
orbital, with its spherical node. Boron atoms therefore have two electrons in the 1s orbital,
two in the 2s orbital, and just one in one of the 2p orbitals. The orbital occupancy is shown in
the energy level diagram on the left. You can imagine what shape each of the orbitals has: we
won’t need to show a picture of them all superimposed.
The next element, carbon, with one more (a sixth) electron, seems to have a choice—it can
put its sixth electron paired with the fi fth one, in the same 2p orbital, or it can put it into a
new 2p orbital, with both electrons unpaired. In fact it chooses the latter: electrons are negatively charged and repel one another, so if there is a choice of equal energy orbitals they
occupy different orbitals singly until they are forced to start pairing up. The repulsion is never
enough to force an electron to occupy a higher energy orbital, but when the orbitals are otherwise of identical energy, this is what happens.
Not surprisingly therefore, the orbitals of atoms of the remainder of the elements of the fi rst
row of the periodic table are occupied as shown below. All the while the entire set of orbitals
is going down in energy because the nucleus is attracting the electrons more strongly, but
otherwise it is a simple matter of fi lling up the 2p orbitals fi rst singly and then doubly. With
the ten electrons of neon, all the orbitals with one node are fi lled, and we say that neon has a
‘closed shell’. A ‘shell’ is a group of orbitals of similar energy all with the same number of
nodes (in this case all called ‘2’ something—2s or 2p).

###### The phase of an orbital

Look at the diagrams below, which are the same as the ones on p. 83: they represent the
fi rst three vibrational frequencies of a string. Now think about the motion of the string itself:
in the fi rst vibration, all of the string moves up and down at the same time—each point on
the string moves by a different amount, but the direction moved at every point is the same.
The same is not true for the second ‘energy level’ of the string—during a vibration like this,
the left-hand half of the string moves upwards while the right-hand half moves downwards—
the two halves of the string are out of phase with one another, and there is a change of phase
at the node. The same is true of the third energy level—again, there is a change of phase at
each node.


all the string moves
in the same direction


different parts of the string, separated by nodes,
move in different directions


The same is true for orbitals. A nodal plane, such as that in the 2p orbitals, divides the orbital
into two parts with different phases, one where the phase of the wavefunction is positive and
one where it is negative. The phases are usually represented by shading—one half is shaded
and the other half not. You saw this in the representation of the 2p orbital above. The phase
of an orbital is arbitrary, in the sense that it doesn’t matter which half you shade. It’s also
important to note that phase is nothing to do with charge: both halves of a fi lled 2p orbital
contain electron density, so both will be negatively charged.
So why is phase important? Well, in a moment we will see that, just as atoms add together
to give molecules, we can add together the wavefunctions of atomic orbitals to give molecular
orbitals, which tell us where electrons are, and how much energy they have, in molecules.


As it happens, the electron density at any point in the orbital is
given by the square of the mathematical function (the wavefunction) which determines the
phase, so both positive and negative values of the wavefunction
give positive electron densities.


###### s, p, d, f

Why 2s, 2p...? These letters hark back to the early days of spectroscopy and refer to the appearance of certain lines in
atomic emission spectra: ‘s’ for ‘sharp’ and ‘p’ for ‘principal’. Later you will meet d and f orbitals, which have other
arrangements of nodes. These letters came from ‘diffuse’ and ‘fundamental’. The letters s, p, d, and f matter and you
must know them, but you do not need to know what they originally stood for.


###### Four short clarifi cations about orbitals before we go on

We’re about to develop the idea of orbitals in order to understand how electrons behave in
molecules, but before we go on, we should just clarify a few points about orbitals that can
sometimes lead to confusion.

**1.** Orbitals do not need to have electrons in them—they can be vacant (there doesn’t
have to be someone standing on a stair for it to exist). Helium’s two electrons fi ll only
the 1s orbital, but an input of energy—the intense heat in the sun, for example—will
make one of them hop up into the previously empty 2s, or 2p, or 3s. . . etc. orbitals
waiting to receive them. In fact, it was observing, from earth, the energy absorbed by
this process which led to the fi rst discovery of helium in the sun.

**2.** Electrons may be found anywhere in an orbital except in a node. In a p orbital
containing one electron, this electron may be found on either side but never in the
middle. When the orbital contains two electrons, one electron doesn’t stay in one half
and the other electron in the other half—both electrons could be anywhere (except in
the node).

**3.** All these orbitals of an atom are superimposed on each other. The 1s orbital is not the
middle part of the 2s orbital. The 1s and 2s orbitals are separate orbitals in their own
rights and each can hold a maximum of two electrons but the 2s orbital does occupy
some of the same space as the 1s orbital (and also as the 2p orbitals, come to that).
Neon, for example, has ten electrons in total: two will be in the 1s orbital, two in the


-----

- This way of building up
molecular from atomic orbitals is
known as the linear

**orbitals or LCAO.**


(much bigger) 2s orbital, and two in each of the three 2p orbitals. All these orbitals are
superimposed on each other.

**4.** As we move across subsequent rows of the periodic table—starting with sodium—the
1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals are already fi lled with electrons, so we must start putting
electrons into the 3s and 3p orbitals, then the 4s, 3d, and 4p orbitals. With d orbitals
(and f orbitals, which start to be fi lled in the lanthanide series) there are yet further
new arrangements of nodes. We won’t be discussing these orbitals in detail—you will
fi nd detailed consideration in an inorganic textbook—but the principles are just the
same as the simple arrangements we have described.

###### Molecular orbitals—diatomic molecules

Now for electrons in molecules. Just as the behaviour of electrons in atoms is dictated by the
**atomic orbitals they reside in, so electrons in molecules behave in ways dictated by the**
**molecular orbitals which contain them. We think of molecules as being built from atoms**
(even if that is not actually how you would usually make them), and likewise we can think of
molecular orbitals as being built up from a combination of atomic orbitals.
As atomic orbitals are wavefunctions, they can be combined in the same way that waves
combine. You may be already familiar with the ideas of combining waves either constructively
(in phase) or destructively (out of phase):

combine in phase combine out of phase

constructive overlap destructive overlap

Atomic orbitals can combine in the same ways—in phase or out of phase. Using two 1s orbitals drawn as circles (representing spheres) with dots to mark the nuclei and shading to represent phase, we can combine them in phase (that is, we add them together), resulting in an
orbital spread over both atoms, or out of phase (by subtracting one from the other). In this
case we get a molecular orbital with a nodal plane down the centre between the two nuclei,
where the wavefunctions of the two atomic orbitals exactly cancel one another out and with
two regions of opposite phase.

generates a bonding molecular orbital generates an antibonding molecular orbital

The resulting orbitals belong to both atoms—they are molecular rather than atomic orbitals.
Now, imagine putting electrons into the fi rst of these orbitals (the bonding orbital). Remember,
you can put zero, one, or two electrons into an orbital, but no more. The diagram of the orbital
shows that the electrons would spend most of their time in between the two atomic nuclei.
Being negatively charged, the electrons will exert an attractive force on each of the nuclei, and
would hold them together. We have a chemical bond! For this reason the in-phase molecular
orbital is called a bonding orbital.


-----

The out-of-phase molecular orbital offers no such attractive possibility—in fact putting
electrons into the out-of-phase molecular orbital works against bonding. These electrons are
mainly to be found anywhere but between the two nuclei, where there is a node. The exposed
positively charged nuclei repel each other, and that is why this orbital is known as an anti**bonding molecular orbital.**
The combination of the atomic 1s orbitals to give the two new molecular orbitals can also
be shown on a molecular orbital energy level diagram. The two atomic orbitals are shown on
the left and the right, and the molecular orbitals which result from combining them in and
out of phase are shown in the middle. The diagram as a whole is a sort of ‘before and after’
diagram—the situation before the interaction between the orbitals is shown on the left and
the right, and after the interaction is shown in the middle. Notice that the bonding orbital is
lower in energy than the constituent 1s orbitals, and the antibonding orbital is higher.

Now we can actually put the electrons into the orbitals, just as we did on p. 84 when we were
building up the picture of atomic orbitals. Each hydrogen atom has one electron and so the
resulting hydrogen molecule (shown in the middle) contains two electrons. Always fi ll up
orbitals from the lowest energy fi rst, putting a maximum of two electrons into each orbital,
so both of these electrons go into the bonding orbital. The antibonding orbital remains
empty. The electrons therefore spend most of their time in between the nuclei, and we have a
plausible explanation for the existence of a chemical bond in the H2 molecule.

**the lowest available orbital.**

filled bonding orbital

Diagrams such as these are central to the way we can use molecular orbital theory (MO
theory) to explain structure and reactivity, and you will in future meet many more of them.
So before we go on it is worth clarifying several points about this one:



- _Two atomic orbitals (AOs) combine to give two molecular orbitals (MOs). You always_
get the same number of MOs out as you put AOs in.

- Adding the wavefunctions (combining them in phase) of the two AOs makes the
bonding orbital; subtracting them (combining them out of phase) makes the
antibonding orbital.


-----

- Since the two atoms are the same (both H), each AO contributes the same amount to
the MOs (this will not always be the case).

- The bonding MO is lower in energy than the AOs.



- The antibonding MO is higher in energy than the AOs.

- Each hydrogen atom initially had one electron. The spin of these electrons is
unimportant.



- The two electrons end up in the MO lowest in energy—the bonding MO.

- Just as with AOs, each MO can hold two electrons as long as the electrons are spinpaired (shown by opposing arrows). You do not need to be concerned with the details
of spin-pairing at this stage, just with the result that any orbital may contain no more
than two electrons.



- The two electrons between the two nuclei in the bonding MO hold the molecule
together—they are the chemical bond.



 - Since these two electrons are lower in energy in the MO than they were in the AOs,
the molecule is more stable than its constituent atoms; energy is given out when the
atoms combine.

 - Or, if you prefer, we must put in energy to separate the two atoms again and to break
the bond.

From now on, we will always represent molecular orbitals in energy order—the highestenergy MO at the top (usually an antibonding MO) and the lowest in energy (usually a bonding MO and the one in which the electrons are most stable) at the bottom.
Before you leave this section, let’s recap how we got to the MO diagram of H2. It’s worth
working through these steps to check you can draw your own MO diagram before you leave
this section.


**1.** Draw two H atoms along with the 1s atomic orbitals which contain the electron, one
on either side of the page.

**2.** Sketch the result of adding and of subtracting the wavefunctions of these two 1s
orbitals to show the bonding and antibonding MOs. These go one above the other
(high energy antibonding orbital on top) in between the AOs.


**3.** Count up the total number of electrons in the atoms going in to the molecule, and
put that number of electrons into the MOs, starting at the bottom and building
upwards, two in each orbital.

###### Breaking bonds


The diagram we have studied shows the most stable ground state of a hydrogen molecule, in
which the electrons have the lowest possible energy. But what happens if an electron is promoted up from the lowest energy level, the bonding MO, to the next lowest energy level, the
antibonding MO? Again, an energy level diagram helps.

-----

Now the electron in the antibonding orbital cancels out the bonding of the electron in the
bonding orbital. Since there is no overall bonding holding the two atoms together, they can
drift apart as two separate atoms with their electrons in 1s AOs. In other words, promoting an
electron from the bonding MO to the antibonding MO breaks the chemical bond. This is diffi cult to do with hydrogen molecules but easy with, say, bromine molecules. Shining light on
Br2 causes it to break up into bromine atoms.

###### Why hydrogen is diatomic but helium is not


Like H atoms, He atoms have their electrons in 1s orbitals, so we can construct an energy level
diagram for He2 in a similar way. But there is one big difference: each helium atom has two
electrons so now both the bonding MO and the antibonding MO are full! Any bonding due
to the electrons in the bonding orbital is cancelled out by the electrons in the antibonding
orbital, and the He2 molecule falls apart. He2 does not exist.

Trying to make a He2 molecule...


1s orbital 1s

###### Bond order

Only if there are more electrons in bonding MOs than in antibonding MOs will there be any
bonding between two atoms. In fact, we defi ne the number of bonds between two atoms as
the bond order (dividing by two since two electrons make up a chemical bond).


(no. of electrons in bonding MOs) − (no. of electrons in antibonding MOs)
bond order =
2


Hence the bond orders for H2 and He2 are

2 − 0
bond order (H )2 = 2 = 1, i.e. a single bond

###### Forming bonds using 2s and 2p atomic orbitals: σσ and π orbitals

Atoms in the row of the periodic table running from Li to F have electrons in 2s and 2p orbitals, and as all molecules of interest to organic chemists contain at least one such atom we now
need to think about how 2s and 2p orbitals interact. We also need to introduce you to a useful
piece of terminology that is used to describe the symmetry of molecular orbitals.
We can do all of this by thinking about the bonding in another ubiquitous diatomic gas, N2.
N atoms have electrons in 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals, so we need to consider interactions between
pairs of each of these orbitals in turn.


-----

1s orbitals we have already dealt with. Combining 2s orbitals is essentially just the same;
they form bonding and antibonding orbitals just as 1s orbitals do and with similar shapes too,
but higher energies, because the 2s orbitals are higher in energy that the 1s orbitals. The 2s
orbitals are also bigger than 1s orbitals, and because of their ‘onion skin’ form, the exact
nature of the MOs they give rise to is more complex than those which come from 1s AOs, but
you can represent them in sketches in just the same way:

1s or 2s 1s or 2s 1s or 2s 1s or 2s

symmetrical symmetrical

**bonding molecular orbital** σ orbital **antibonding molecular orbital** σ∗ orbital

The bonding orbitals formed from 1s–1s and 2s–2s interactions have another important
feature in common: they are all cylindrically symmetrical. In other words, if you look at the
molecular orbital end-on, you can rotate it around the axis between the two atoms by any
amount and it looks identical. It has the symmetry of a cigar, a carrot, or a baseball bat.
Bonding orbitals with cylindrical symmetry like this are known as σ (sigma) orbitals, and the
bonds which result from putting two electrons into these orbitals are known as σ bonds. The
single bond in the H2 molecule is therefore a σ bond.
The antibonding orbitals which result from combining these AOs are also cylindrically
symmetrical and are called σ* orbitals, with the * denoting their antibonding character.
Now for the 2p orbitals. As described on p. 86 each atom has three mutually perpendicular
2p atomic orbitals. In a diatomic molecule, such as N2, these 2p orbitals must combine in two
different ways—one p orbital from each atom (shown in red here) can overlap end-on, but the
other two p orbitals on each atom (shown in black) must combine side-on.

these two pairs of p orbitals must combine side-on

each atom has three

2p orbitals

only these two p orbitals
can overlap end-on

We’ll deal with the end-on overlap fi rst. This is what happens if we combine the two 2p
orbitals out of phase: as with the 2s orbitals, we have a node between the atoms, and any electron in this MO would spend most of its time not between the nuclei—as you can guess, this
is an antibonding orbital.

If we combine the orbitals in phase, this is what we get.

**bonding σ** molecular orbital

There is a nice rich area of electron density between the nuclei, and somewhat less outside,
so overall fi lling this orbital with electrons would lead to an attraction between the atoms and
a bond would result.
Both of these MOs have cylindrical symmetry and are therefore designated σ and σ* orbitals, and a bond formed by fi lling the MO made from interacting two 2p orbitals end-on is
called a σ bond.



- σ bonds can be made from s or p atomic orbitals, provided they form a cylindrically
**symmetrical molecular orbital.**


Each atom presents its other two 2p orbitals for side-on overlap. This is what the antibonding MO formed by out-of-phase combination of two side-on p orbitals looks like:

These MOs do not have cylindrical symmetry—in fact you have to rotate them 180° about
the axis between the nuclei before you get back something looking like what you started with
but with opposite phase—and as a result the symmetry of these orbitals is given the symbol
π: the bonding orbital is a π orbital and the antibonding orbital is a π* orbital. Bonds which
are formed by fi lling π orbitals are called π bonds, and you’ll notice that because of the π symmetry the electron density in these bonds does not lie directly between the two nuclei but
rather to either side of the line joining them.
Since an atom has three mutually perpendicular 2p orbitals, two of which can interact sideon in this way, there will exist a pair of degenerate (equal in energy) mutually perpendicular
π orbitals and likewise a pair of degenerate mutually perpendicular π* orbitals. (The third p
orbital interacts end-on, forming a σ orbital and a σ* orbital, of course).
The two sorts of MOs arising from the combinations of the p orbitals are, however, not
degenerate—more overlap is possible when the AOs overlap end-on than when they overlap
side-on. As a result, the 2p–2p σ orbital is lower in energy than the 2p–2p π orbitals.
We can now draw an energy level diagram to show the combinations of the 1s, 2s, and 2p
AOs to form MOs, labelling each of the energy levels with σ, σ*, π, or π* as appropriate.



- Because it can be diffi cult to

adding and subtracting p
orbitals, you will often see π
and π* orbitals represented in
diagrams simply as their
‘uncombined’ p orbitals—the

Calculating the bond order in N2 is easy—a total of ten bonding electrons and four antibonding electrons gives a credit of six, or a bond order of three. N2 has a triple-bonded
structure.
We can’t, however, ignore the electrons that are not involved in bonding: there are eight of
them altogether. These non-bonding electrons can be thought of as being localized on each
of the N atoms. The four 1s electrons are low-energy inner shell electrons that are not involved
in the chemistry of N2, while the four 2s electrons provide the non-bonded lone pairs located
one on each N atom. In the structure shown here we have drawn them in: you don’t have to
draw lone pairs of every molecule that has them, but sometimes it can be useful to emphasize
them—for example if they are taking part in a reaction scheme.

###### Bonds between different atoms

Up to now we have only considered combining two atoms of the same element, which makes
things simpler because the same orbitals on each of the two atoms have the same energy. But
when the two atoms are different two things change. The fi rst is obvious—the number of electrons contributed by each atom is different. This is easy to accommodate since it just affects the
total number of electrons we need to put into the MO diagram when we fi ll up the energy
levels. So, for example, if you were constructing an MO diagram for NO, the gas nitric oxide
(NO, a rather remarkable biological messenger in the human body) rather than N2, you simply
put in a total of 15 rather than 14 electrons because O contributes eight electrons and N seven.

###### Nitric oxide, NO

Nitric oxide was for a long time known only as one of the villains of urban air pollution, being formed during the combustion of petroleum and other fossil fuels. In the last 20 years, however, it has become evident that it is much more than
that—one unexpected role, which earned its discoverers the Nobel Prize in physiology in 1998, is as a biological messenger, managing the contraction of smooth vessels and hence regulating blood fl ow.


The second thing that changes when you have two different atoms bonded together is the
relative energies of the AOs being combined. It may seem natural to assume that a 2p orbital
has the same energy whatever atom it fi nds itself in, but of course the difference is that an
electron in a 2p (or any other) orbital feels an attraction to the nucleus which depends on the
nuclear charge. The greater the number of protons in the nucleus, the greater the attraction,
and hence the more tightly held, more stable, and lower in energy the electron becomes.
This is the origin of electronegativity. The more electronegative an atom is, the more it attracts
electrons, the lower in energy are its AOs, and so any electrons in them are held more tightly.


-----

Electronegativity increases
across each row but decreases
down each column even though
the nuclear charge increases.
This is because once electrons
start fi lling a new shell they are
shielded from the nucleus by all
the electrons in the lower energy
fi lled shells. You can fi nd more
detailed information in an
inorganic chemistry textbook.


As you move across each row of the periodic table, therefore, electronegativity increases as the
energy of each orbital drops. From Li (electronegativity 0.98) across to C (2.55), and on to N
(3.04), O (3.44), and F (3.98), the elements steadily become more electronegative and the AOs
lower in energy.
So our diagram of the orbitals of NO actually looks like this.

We have shown only the 2s and 2p orbitals as the 1s orbitals are much lower in energy, and as
you saw in the diagram of N2 on p. 94 their bonding and antibonding interactions cancel each
other out.
The orbitals on O are lower in energy than the orbitals on N, but they still interact just fi ne.
However, there is one interesting consequence: if you look at each bonding orbital, you will
see that it is closer in energy to the contributing orbital on O than the contributing orbital on
N. Likewise, each antibonding orbital is closer in energy to the contributing orbital on N than
the contributing orbital on O. The result is that the MOs are unsymmetrical, and while all the
bonding orbitals have a greater contribution from the oxygen AOs, all the antibonding orbitals have a greater contribution from the nitrogen AOs. Overall the diagram shows eight electrons in bonding orbitals and three electrons in antibonding orbitals, so the overall electron
distribution is skewed (polarized) towards O, just as you would expect from a comparison of
the electronegativities of N and O.
The eight electrons in bonding orbitals and three electrons in antibonding orbitals means
that NO has a bond order of 2½. It also has an unpaired electron—it is a radical. We can’t
easily represent half a bond in valence bond terms, so we usually draw NO with a double
bond, representing four bonding electrons. The remaining seven electrons can be shown as
three lone pairs and one unpaired electron. Where do we put them? Well, our MO diagram
tells us that the unpaired electron occupies an orbital closer in energy to N than to O, so we
put that on N.
N and O differ only slightly in electronegativity (electronegativity of N 3.04; O 3.44): their
orbitals are quite close in energy and form stable covalent bonds. But we also need to consider
what happens when two atoms forming a bond differ hugely in electronegativity. We can take
sodium (electronegativity 0.93) and chlorine (electronegativity 3.16) as our example. We
know from observation that the product of reacting these two elements (don’t try this at
home) is the ionic solid Na[+]Cl[−], and the MO energy level diagram tells us why.
The AOs we need to consider are the 3s and 3p orbitals of Na (all its lower energy 1s, 2s, and
2p orbitals are fi lled, so we can ignore those, as we did with the 1s orbitals of N2 and NO above)
and the 3s and 3p orbitals of Cl (again, the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals are all fi lled). Here is the
diagram, with the Na orbitals much higher in energy than the Cl orbitals.

happens in the second row of

come as no surprise to you to
learn that the electronic structure

orbitals. You might like to think

But these AOs are too far apart in energy to combine to form new MOs and no covalent bond

electrons available to fi ll these orbitals are the seven provided by Cl plus the one from Na: we
end up with Na[+] and Cl[−]. The ionic bonding in NaCl is due simply to the attraction between
two oppositely charged ions—there is no orbital overlap.
These three different cases where the two combining orbitals differ greatly in energy, only
a little, or not at all are summarized below.

energy than AO on atom A energy than AO on atom A

A[−] and B[+] (this point is discussed more
fully in Chapters 24 and 37)


-----

###### Other factors affecting degree of orbital interaction

Having similar energies is not the only criterion for good interaction between two AOs. It also
matters how the orbitals overlap. We have seen that p orbitals overlap better in an end-on
fashion (forming a σ bond) than they do side-on (forming a π bond). Another factor is the size
of the AOs. For best overlap, the orbitals should be the same size—a 2p orbital overlaps much
better with another 2p orbital than it does with a 3p or 4p orbital.

efficient overlap between orbitals inefficient overlap between orbitals of
of similar size (e.g. 2p–2p) different size (e.g. 3p–2p)

A third factor is the symmetry of the orbitals—two AOs must have the appropriate symmetry to combine. Thus a 2px orbital cannot combine with a 2py or 2pz orbital since they are all
perpendicular to each other (they are orthogonal). Depending on the alignment, there is
either no overlap at all or any constructive overlap is cancelled out by equal amounts of
destructive overlap. Likewise, an s orbital can overlap with a p orbital only end-on. Sideways
overlap leads to equal amounts of bonding and antibonding interactions and no overall gain
in energy.

a molecule of methane
enclosed in a cube


###### Molecular orbitals of molecules with more than two atoms

We now need to look at ways of combining more than two atoms at a time. For some molecules, such as H2S and PH3, which have all bond angles equal to 90°, the bonding should be
straightforward—the 3p orbitals (which are at 90°) on the central atom simply overlap with
the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms.
Now, you might imagine it would be similar for ammonia, NH3, since N lies above P in the
periodic table. The trouble is, we know experimentally that the bond angles in ammonia, as
in water and methane, are not 90°, but instead 104°, 107°, and 109°, respectively. All the covalent compounds of elements in the row Li to Ne raise this diffi culty. How can we get 109°
angles from orbitals arranged 90° apart?
To see what has to happen, we’ll start with a molecule of methane enclosed in a cube. It is
possible to do this since the opposite corners of a cube describe a perfect tetrahedron. The
carbon atom is at the centre of the cube and the four hydrogen atoms are at four of the
corners.
Now let’s consider each of the carbon’s 2s and 2p AOs in turn. The carbon’s 2s orbital can
overlap with all four hydrogen 1s orbitals at once with all the orbitals in the same phase.


-----

Each of the 2p orbitals points to a pair of opposite faces of the cube. Once more all four
hydrogen 1s orbitals can combine with each p orbital, provided the hydrogen AOs on the
opposite faces of the cube are of opposite phases.

2pz 2py 2px

the hydrogen 1s orbitals can overlap with the three 2p orbitals

The three MOs generated in this way are degenerate, and this gives us four bonding orbitals.
Along with four associated antibonding orbitals this gives us a total of eight MOs, which is
correct since there were eight AOs (C gave us 2s and 3 × 2p, while 4 × H gave us 4 × 1s).
Using this approach, it is possible to construct a complete MO picture of methane—and
indeed for very much more complex molecules than methane. There is experimental evidence too that these pictures are correct. But the problem is this: the four fi lled, bonding
orbitals of methane are not all the same (one came from the interaction with the C 2s orbital
and three from the C 2p orbitals). But we also know from experimental observations all four
C–H bonds in methane are the same.
Something seems to be wrong, but there is in fact no contradiction. The MO approach tells
us that there is one MO of one kind and three of another but the electrons in them are shared
out over all fi ve atoms. No one hydrogen atom has more or fewer electrons than any other—
they are all equivalent. Techniques that tell us the structure of methane do not tell us where
bonds are; they simply tell us where the atoms are located in space—we draw in bonds connecting atoms together. Certainly the atoms form a regular tetrahedron but exactly where the
electrons are is a different matter entirely. So, do we have to give up the idea that methane has
four bonds, each made of two electrons, linking the C with an H? If we choose to, then for
every reaction, even of the simplest molecules, we are going to need to calculate, by computer,
a full set of MOs and all of their interactions.
That would be using physics to do chemistry. It might be accurate but it would kill creativity
and invention. So here is an alternative: we keep our tried and tested practical picture of
molecules made from discrete bonds, each containing a pair of electrons, but we make it
compatible with MO theory. To do this we need a concept known as hybridization.

###### Hybridization of atomic orbitals

To get a picture of methane with four equivalent pairs of electrons we need to start with four
equivalent AOs on C, which we don’t have. But we can get them if we combine the carbon 2s
and 2p orbitals fi rst to make four new orbitals, each composed of one-quarter of the 2s orbital
and three-quarters of one of the p orbitals. The new orbitals are called sp[3] (that’s said s-p-three,
not s-p-cubed) hybrid orbitals to show the proportions of the AOs in each. This process of mixing is called hybridization. The hybrid orbitals are mathematically equivalent to the 2s and 2p
orbitals we started with, and they have the advantage that when we use them to make MOs
the orbitals correspond to bonding pairs of electrons.

-----

What do the four hybrid orbitals look like? Each sp[3] orbital takes three-quarters of its character from a p orbital and one-quarter from an s orbital. It has a planar node through the
nucleus like a p orbital but one lobe is larger than the other because of the extra contribution
of the 2s orbital: the symmetry of the 2s orbital means that adding it to a 2p orbital will
increase the size of the wavefunction in one lobe, but decrease it in the other.

The four sp[3] orbitals point to the corners of a tetrahedron and we build up a molecule of
methane by overlapping the large lobe of each sp[3] orbital with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen
atom, as shown in the margin. Each overlap forms an MO (2sp[3] + 1s) and we can put two
electrons in each to form a C–H σ bond. There will of course also be an antibonding MO, σ*
(2sp[3] – 1s) in each case, but these orbitals are empty. Overall, the electrons are spatially distributed exactly as they were in our previous model, but now we can think of them as being located
in four bonds.

The great advantage of this method is that it can be used to build up structures of much
larger molecules quickly and without having to imagine that the molecule is made up from
isolated atoms. Take **ethane, for example. Each carbon uses three sp[3] AOs orientated**
towards the three hydrogen atoms, leaving one sp[3] orbital on each carbon atom for the
C–C bond.
In the MO energy level diagram we now have both C–H bonding σ and antibonding σ*
orbitals (made from combining sp[3] orbitals on C with 1s orbitals on H) and also a C–C
bonding σ and antibonding σ* orbital, made from two sp[3] orbitals on C. The diagram

orbitals needed for the C–H framework and see what is left over. In this case we need three
equivalent bonds from each carbon atom (one to make a C–C bond and two to make C–H
bonds). Therefore we need to combine the 2s orbital on each carbon atom with two p orbitals
to make the three bonds. We could hybridize the 2s, 2py, and 2pz orbitals (that is, all the AOs
in the plane) to form three equal sp[2] orbitals, leaving the 2pz orbital unchanged. These sp[2]
hybrid orbitals will have one-third s character and only two-thirds p character.

The three sp[2] hybrid AOs on each carbon atom can overlap with three other orbitals (two

two 2px orbitals, one on each carbon, which combine to form the π MO. The skeleton of the
molecule has fi ve σ bonds (one C–C and four C–H) in the plane and the central π bond is
formed by two 2px orbitals above and below the plane.

This is the fi rst MO picture we have constructed with a C=C double bond, and it is worth
taking the time to think about the energies of the orbitals involved. We’ll again ignore the
C–H bonds, which involve two of the sp[2] orbitals of each C atom. Remember, we mixed two
of the three 2p orbitals in with the 2s orbital to make 3 × sp[2] orbitals on each C atom, leaving
behind one unhybridized 2p orbital.
Now, fi rst we need to generate the σ and σ* orbitals by interacting one sp[2] orbital on each atom.
Then we need to deal with the two p orbitals, one on each C, which interact side-on. The unhybridized p orbitals are a bit higher in energy than the sp[2] orbitals, but they interact less well (we
discussed this on p. 93) so they give a π orbital and a π* orbital whose energies are in between the
σ and σ* orbitals. Each C atom donates two electrons to these orbitals (the other two electrons are
involved in the two bonds to H), so the overall picture looks like this. Two AOs give two MOs.

Ethyne (acetylene) has a C≡C triple bond. Each carbon bonds to only two other atoms to

two atoms at once so we can hybridize these to form two sp hybrids on each carbon atom,
leaving the 2py and 2pz to form π MOs with the 2p orbitals on the other carbon atom. These
sp hybrids have 50% each s and p character and form a linear carbon skeleton.

Hydrocarbon skeletons are built up from tetrahedral (sp[3]), trigonal planar (sp[2]), or linear (sp)
hybridized carbon atoms. Deciding what sort of hybridization any carbon atom has, and
hence what sort of orbitals it will use to make bonds, is easy. All you have to do is count up the
atoms bonded to each carbon atom. If there are two, that carbon atom is linear (sp hybridized), if there are three, that carbon atom is trigonal (sp[2] hybridized), and if there are four, that
carbon atom is tetrahedral (sp[3] hybridized). Since the remaining unhybridized p orbitals are
used to make the π orbitals of double or triple bonds, you can also work out hybridization state
just by counting up the number of π bonds at each carbon. Carbon atoms with no π bonds
are tetrahedral (sp[3] hybridized), those with one π bond are trigonal (sp[2] hybridized), and those
with two π bonds are linear (sp hybridized).
There’s a representative example on the left. This hydrocarbon (hex-5-en-2-yne) has two linear
sp carbon atoms (C2 and C3), two trigonal sp[2] carbon atoms (C5 and C6), a tetrahedral sp[3] CH2
group in the middle of the chain (C4), and a tetrahedral sp[3] methyl group (C1) at the end of the
chain. We had no need to look at any AOs to deduce this—we needed only to count the bonds.

###### We can hybridize any atoms

We can use the same ideas with any sort of atom. The three molecules shown on the next page

atom, whether this is B, C, or N, and the same total number of bonding electrons—the molecules are said to be isoelectronic. The atoms contribute different numbers of electrons so to
get the eight bonding electrons we need we have to add one to BH4 and subtract one from
NH4—hence the charges in BH4− and NH4+. In each case the central atom can be considered to
be sp[3] hybridized, using an sp[3] orbital to bond to each of the four H atoms, each resulting σ
bond being made up of two electrons.
Compounds of the same three elements with only three bonds take more thinking about.
Borane, BH3, has only three pairs of bonding electrons (three from B and three from the three
H atoms). Since the central boron atom bonds to only three other atoms we can therefore
describe it as being sp[2] hybridized. Each of the B–H bonds results from the overlap of an sp[2]
orbital with the hydrogen 1s orbital. Its remaining p orbital is not involved in bonding and
must remain empty. Do not be tempted by the alternative structure with tetrahedral boron
and an empty sp[3] orbital. You want to populate the lowest energy orbitals for greatest stability
and sp[2] orbitals with their greater s character are lower in energy than sp[3] orbitals. Another
way to put this is that, if you have to have an empty orbital, it is better to have one with the
highest possible energy since it has no electrons in it and so it doesn’t affect the stability of the
molecule.
Borane is isoelectronic with the methyl cation, CH3+ or Me+. All the arguments we have just
applied to borane also apply to Me[+] so it too is sp[2] hybridized with a vacant p orbital. This will
be very important when we discuss the reactions of carbocations in Chapters 15 and 36.
Now what about ammonia, NH3? Ammonia is not isoelectronic with borane and Me[+]! It has
a total of eight electrons—fi ve from N and three from 3 × H. As well as three N–H bonds, each
with two electrons, the central nitrogen atom also has a lone pair of electrons. We have a
choice: either we could hybridize the nitrogen atom sp[2] and put the lone pair in the p orbital
or we could hybridize the nitrogen sp[3] and have the lone pair in an sp[3] orbital.
This is the opposite of the situation with borane and Me[+]. The extra pair of electrons does
contribute to the energy of ammonia so it prefers to be in the lower-energy orbital, sp[3], rather
than pure p. Experimentally the H–N–H bond angles are all 107.3°. Clearly, this is much
closer to the 109.5° sp[3] angle than the 120° sp[2] angle. But the bond angles are not exactly
109.5°, so ammonia cannot be described as pure sp[3] hybridized. One way of looking at this is
to say that the lone pair repels the bonds more than they repel each other. Alternatively, you
could say that the orbital containing the lone pair must have slightly more s character while
the N–H bonding orbitals must have correspondingly more p character.

###### The carbonyl group

The C=O double bond is the most important functional group in organic chemistry. It is
present in aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, amides, and so on. We shall spend several chapters
discussing its chemistry so it is important that you understand its electronic structure from
this early stage. We’ll use the simplest carbonyl compound, methanal (formaldehyde), as our
example. As in alkenes, the carbon atom needs three sp[2] orbitals to form σ bonds with the two
H atoms and the O atom. But what about oxygen? It needs only to form one σ bond to C, but
it needs two more hybrid orbitals for its lone pairs: the oxygen atom of a carbonyl group is also
sp[2] hybridized. A p orbital from the carbon and one from the oxygen make up the π bond,
which also contains two electrons. This is what the bonding looks like:


How do we know the O has its
lone pairs in sp[2] orbitals? Well,
whenever carbonyl compounds
form bonds using those lone
pairs—hydrogen bonds, for
example—they prefer to do so
in a direction corresponding to
where the lone pairs are
expected to be.

For the MO energy diagram, we’ll again just consider the bonding between C and O. First,
we hybridize the orbitals of both atoms to give us the 3 × sp[2] orbitals and 1 × p orbital we need.
Notice that we have made the AOs at O lower in energy than the AOs at C because O is more
electronegative. Once we have accounted for the non-bonding sp[2] orbitals at O and the two
C–H bonds, we allow the two remaining sp[2] orbitals to interact and make a σ and a σ* orbital,
and the two p orbitals to make a π and a π* orbital.

- Alkenes have nucleophilic π
bonds while carbonyl
compounds have electrophilic π
bonds. If you are not yet familiar
with these terms, you will meet
them in Chapter 5.


The fact that oxygen is more electronegative than carbon has two consequences for this
diagram. Firstly it makes the energy of the orbitals of a C=O bond lower than they would be
in the corresponding C=C bond. That has consequences for the reactivity of alkenes and
carbonyl compounds, as you will see in the next chapter.
The second consequence is polarization. You met this idea before when we were looking at
NO. Look at the fi lled π orbital in the MO energy level diagram. It is more similar in energy to
the p orbital on O than the p orbital on C. We can interpret this by saying that it receives a
_greater contribution from the p orbital on O than from the p orbital on C. Consequently the_
orbital is distorted so that it is bigger at the O end than at the C end, and the electrons spend
more time close to O. The same is true for the σ bond, and the consequent polarization of the
C=O group can be represented by one of two symbols for a dipole—the arrow with the cross
at the positive end or the pair of δ+ and δ– symbols.

Conversely, if you look at the antibonding π* orbital, it is closer in energy to the p orbital
on C than the p orbital on O and therefore it receives a greater contribution from the p
orbital on C. It is distorted towards the carbon end of the bond. Of course, being empty, the
π* orbital has no effect on the structure of the C=O bond. However, it does have an effect on
its reactivity—it is easier to put electrons into the antibonding π* orbital at the C end than
at the O end.

###### Rotation and rigidity

To end this chapter, we deal with one more question which MOs allow us to answer: how fl exible is a molecule? The answer depends on the molecule of course, but more importantly it
depends on the type of bond. You may be aware that many alkenes can exist in two forms, cis
and trans, also called Z and E (see Chapter 17). These two forms are not usually easy to interconvert—in other words the C=C double bond is very rigid and cannot rotate.
If we look at the bonding in but-2-ene we can see why. The π bond is made up of two parallel
p orbitals. To rotate about the π bond requires those orbitals to lose their interaction, pass
through a state in which they lie perpendicular, and fi nally line up again. That transitional,
perpendicular state is very unfavourable because all of the energy gained through π bonding
is lost. Alkenes are rigid and do not rotate.

###### Alkene isomers

Maleic and fumaric acids were known in the nineteenth century to have the same chemical composition and the same
functional groups, and yet they were different compounds—why remained a mystery. That is, until 1874 when van’t Hoff
proposed that free rotation about double bonds was restricted. This meant that, whenever each carbon atom of a double
bond had two different substituents, isomers would be possible. He proposed the terms cis (Latin meaning ‘on this side’)
and trans (Latin meaning ‘across or on the other side’) for the two isomers. The problem was: which isomer was which?
On heating, maleic acid readily loses water to become maleic anhydride so this isomer must have both acid groups on
the same side of the double bond.

Compare that situation with butane. Rotating about the middle bond doesn’t break any
bonds because the σ bond is, by defi nition, cylindrically symmetrical. Atoms connected only
by a σ bond are therefore considered to be rotationally free, and the two ends of butane can
spin relative to one another.

Alkanes rotate freely...


It is in fact possible to interconvert cis and trans alkenes, but it
requires a considerable amount
of energy—around 260 kJ
mol[−1]. One way to break the π
bond is to promote an electron
from the π orbital to the π*
orbital. If this were to happen,
there would be one electron in
the bonding π orbital and one in
the antibonding π* orbital, and
hence no overall bonding. The
energy required to do this corresponds to light in the ultraviolet
(UV) region of the spectrum.
Shining UV light on an alkene
can break the π bond (but not
the σ bond) and allows rotation
to occur.



- In fact not all orientations
about a σ bond are equally
favourable. We come back to
this aspect of structure, known
as conformation, in Chapter 16.

The same comparison works for ethylene (ethene) and ethane: in ethylene all the atoms lie
in a plane, enforced by the need for overlap between the p orbitals. But in ethane, the two
ends of the molecule spin freely. This difference in rigidity has important consequences
throughout chemistry, and we will come back to it in more detail in Chapter 16.

###### Conclusion

We have barely touched the enormous variety of molecules, but it is important that you realize at this point that these simple ideas of structural assembly can be applied to the most
complicated molecules known. We can use AOs and combine them into MOs to solve the
structure of very small molecules and to deduce the structures of small parts of much larger
molecules. With the additional concept of conjugation in Chapter 7 you will be able to grasp
the structure of any organic compound. From now on we shall use terms like AO and MO, 2p
orbital, sp[2] hybridization, σ bond, energy level, and populated orbital without further explanation. If you are unsure about any of them, refer back to this chapter.

###### Looking forward

We started the chapter with atomic orbitals, which we combined into molecular orbitals. But
what happens when the orbitals of two molecules interact? This is what happens during chemical reactions, and it’s where we are heading in the next chapter.

###### Chemical reactions


Most molecules are at peace with themselves. Bottles of sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide,
water, or acetone can be safely stored in a laboratory cupboard for years without any change
in the chemical composition of the molecules inside. Yet if these compounds are mixed,
chemical reactions, in some cases vigorous ones, will occur. This chapter is an introduction to
the behaviour of organic molecules: why some react together and some don’t, and how to
understand reactivity in terms of charges, orbitals, and the movement of electrons. We shall
also be introducing a device for representing the detailed movement of electrons—the mechanism of the reaction—called the curly arrow.
To understand organic chemistry you need to be fl uent in two languages. The fi rst is the
language of structure: of atoms, bonds, and orbitals. This language was the concern of the
last three chapters: in Chapter 2 we looked at how to draw structures, in Chapter 3 how to
fi nd out what those structures are, and in Chapter 4 how to explain structure using electrons
in orbitals.
But now we need to take up a second language: that of reactivity. Chemistry is fi rst and
foremost about the dynamic features of molecules—how to create new molecules from old
ones, for example. To understand this we need new terminology and tools for explaining,
predicting, and talking about reactions.
Molecules react because they move. Atoms have (limited) movement within molecules—
you saw in Chapter 3 how the stretching and bending of bonds can be detected by infrared
spectroscopy, and we explained in Chapter 4 how the σ bonds of alkanes (but not the π bonds
of alkenes) rotate freely. On top of that, in a liquid or a gas whole molecules move around
continuously. They bump into each other, into the walls of the container, maybe into solvent


Marcellin Berthelot (1827–
1907) pointed out in 1860 that
‘chemistry’s creative capability,
resembling that of art itself,
distinguishes it from the natural
and historical sciences’.

in a solution. It is all this incessant motion which drives reactions, and we fi rst need to look
at what happens when molecules collide.

###### Not all collisions between molecules lead to chemical change

Molecules are coated with a layer of electrons which occupy bonding and maybe nonbonding orbitals. As a result the surface of each molecule is negatively charged and by and
large molecules repel each other. Reactions can occur only if a pair of molecules have
enough energy to overcome this superfi cial repulsion. If they don’t, they will simply
bounce off one another like two balls in pool or snooker, exchanging energy and moving
off with new velocities, but remaining chemically unchanged. That minimum energy
requirement for reaction—a barrier over which molecules must pass if they are to react—is
known as the activation energy. In any sample of a compound, the molecules will have a
range of energies, but at least some must have more than the activation energy if they are
to react.

###### Charge attraction brings molecules together

If you mix a solution of sodium chloride with a solution of silver nitrate, electrostatic attraction between the Ag[+] cations and Cl[−] anions is enough to bring them together into a stable,
crystalline ionic lattice of silver chloride, which precipitates from solution. Both ions are of
course surrounded by electrons, but the defi cit of negative charge in the Ag[+] cation (one electron short of the full Ag complement of 47) is enough to overcome the repulsion between the
rest of the electrons.
Direct reaction of a cation and an anion is rare with organic molecules because there are relatively few stable organic anions, and even fewer stable organic cations. A more common cause
of organic reactions is attraction between a charged reagent (a cation or anion) and an organic
compound that both possess a dipole. An example that we shall explore in this chapter (and
which decorates the cover of this book) is the reaction between a carbonyl compound such as
formaldehyde (methanal) and one of those few stable organic anions, cyanide (−CN, in the
form of its salt NaCN). The carbonyl group of formaldehyde is polarized because oxygen is
more electronegative than carbon (see p. 103). The negative cyanide ion is attracted to the positive end of the carbonyl group dipole.
Actually, it isn’t necessary for either reagent to be charged. Water also reacts with formaldehyde and this time it is the lone pair of electrons—the non-bonding pair of electrons located
on the oxygen atom of the uncharged water molecule—that is attracted to the positive end of
the carbonyl dipole.

###### Orbital overlap brings molecules together

Charges and dipoles can help bring molecules together for reaction, helping them to overcome their electronic repulsion and lowering their activation energy. But reactions can still
take place even between completely uncharged molecules with no dipole, provided their
molecular orbitals can interact. One of the old ‘tests’ for unsaturation was to treat a compound with bromine water. If the brown colour disappeared, the molecule was unsaturated
(contained double bonds). Spectroscopy means we rarely need to use such tests now, but the
reaction is still an important one. An alkene reacts with bromine, even though the alkene
and the bromine molecule have neither charge nor dipole. The attraction between these
molecules is not electrostatic; instead, their electronic repulsion is overcome because
the bromine molecule has an empty orbital available—the σ* orbital of the Br–Br bond—
which can accept electrons from the alkene. Unlike the repulsive interaction between
fi lled orbitals, the interaction between a fi lled and an unfi lled orbital can lead to attraction
and reaction.
In fact, orbital interactions are also involved in the other two reactions on this page, but in
those cases the orbital interactions are augmented by electrostatic attraction.

- **To summarize the situation:**

**•** **In general, molecules repel each other, and need to overcome a barrier with a minimum**
**amount of activation energy in order to react.**

**•** **Most organic reactions involve interactions between full and empty orbitals.**

**•** **Many, but not all, also involve charge interactions, which help overcome electronic repulsion.**

**•** **Some ionic reactions involve nothing but charge attraction.**

**We don’t need to analyse whether charge or orbital interaction is the most important factor**
**in bringing molecules together, but you do need to be aware that both may be involved to**
**varying degrees.**


###### Reactions happen when electrons fl ow between molecules

When, as a result of these interactions, a pair of molecules fi nd themselves close together, a
reaction can take place provided electrons move from one molecule to another. This is what
we call the mechanism of the reaction—the detailed description of the pathway the electrons take. In most organic reactions, the electrons start in one molecule and move towards
another. We call the molecule that accepts the electrons the electrophile (electron-lover) for
obvious reasons. The molecule that donates the electrons is called the nucleophile.

 - **A bond forms when electrons move from a nucleophile to an electrophile:**

electron
from nucleophile movement to electrophile
**(Nu or Nu[–])** (E or E[+])

**The nucleophile donates electrons.**

**The electrophile accepts electrons.**

Here’s a very simple example where the nucleophile is an anion (Cl[−]) and the electrophile is
a cation (H[+]). The two are brought together by charge attraction, and the new bond is formed
by electrons donated by the nucleophile. Since we are representing the formation of a new
bond by the movement of electrons, it’s natural to use an arrow to show the way the electrons
fl ow. Arrows used to show electron fl ow are always curved: we call them ‘curly arrows’. The
arrow showing the reaction itself is straight.

In the next example, neither the nucleophile (ammonia, NH3) nor the electrophile (borane,

non-bonding lone pair at N and the empty p orbital on B. Electrons fl ow from the nucleophile
(NH3) to the electrophile (BH3) and a new bond is formed.

A ‘dative covalent bond’ is just
an ordinary σ bond whose electrons happen to come from one
atom. Most bonds are formed by
electron donation from one
atom to another and a classifi cation that makes it necessary to
know the history of the molecule
is not useful. The only important
distinction you need to make
between types of covalent
bonds is between σ bonds and
π bonds.


The charges on the B and the N are necessary simply to account correctly for the electrons.
Usually, we think of the pair of electrons in a bond as coming one from each of the bonded
atoms. But here, since nitrogen donates both electrons (such bonds used to be called ‘dative
bonds’) we have to account for the fact that boron ends up with one electron extra, and nitrogen one electron too few. The bond that forms is just a normal σ bond.

###### Orbital overlap is essential for successful reaction


In the reaction of ammonia with borane, not only do the molecules have to collide with
enough energy to react, but they must also collide with the orbitals aligned correctly for them
to interact. As you saw in Chapter 3, the lone pair of the nitrogen atom resides in a fi lled, nonbonding sp[3] orbital. This orbital has to overlap with the empty p orbital on B to form a bond.
So, a collision like this

reasons—fi rstly it has more

Of course we can also draw a molecular orbital energy level diagram for the constructive,
end-on interaction of the orbitals: look back to Chapter 4 to remind yourself of how to do this.
Here, we need the fi lled sp[3] orbital on N to interact with the empty p orbital on B to give a new
σ bonding orbital and an empty σ* antibonding orbital. Finally, putting in the two electrons
from the N’s lone pair gives us a full picture of the new B–N bond.

The energy level diagram makes it clear why bonding is favourable too: the electrons have
dropped down from the non-bonding sp[3] orbital to the new lower energy bonding σ orbital.
We don’t need to consider what has happened to the energy of the unfi lled orbitals because
they’re empty and don’t contribute to the energy of the molecule as a whole.
We can generalize this idea to work out what makes a good nucleophile and a good electrophile. We’ll use an imaginary, generic nucleophile Nu, with a pair of electrons in some sort of
fi lled orbital (it doesn’t matter what this orbital is) which it can donate to the empty orbital of a
generic electrophile E. Here are three versions of the molecular orbital energy level diagram:

On the left, the energies of the fi lled Nu orbital and the empty E orbital are almost the same.
There is a signifi cant gain in energy when the new bond forms between them. On the right,
there is a large difference between the energies of the fi lled Nu orbital and the empty E orbital,
and the energy gain is negligible. This tells us something: the best reactions are ones in
**which the energies of the interacting orbitals are similar in energy.**



- **For a reaction to take place, molecules must:**

**•** **overcome their electronic repulsion by charge attraction and/or orbital overlap**



**•** **have orbitals of appropriate energy to interact—a fi lled orbital on the nucleophile and an**
**empty orbital on the electrophile**

**•** **approach each other such that these orbitals can overlap to form a bonding interaction.**


###### Nucleophiles and electrophiles

What does this mean for nucleophiles and electrophiles? Well, in general, fi lled orbitals tend
to be low in energy—that is after all why they are fi lled! Conversely, empty orbitals tend to be
high in energy. So the best interaction (the one that gains the new molecule the most energy)
is likely to be between the highest in energy of all the fi lled orbitals—an orbital we can term
the ‘highest occupied molecular orbital’ or HOMO for short—and the lowest in energy of all
of the unfi lled orbitals—the ‘lowest unoccupied molecular orbital’ or LUMO for short. This
diagram may help clarify this idea—it’s a repeat of the best interaction above (the one on the
left), but with other orbitals sketched in.

Remember, we can ignore all interactions between pairs of fi lled orbitals (bonding
and antibonding cancel out, see p. 94) and pairs of unfi lled orbitals (they don’t contain
electrons so don’t contribute to the stability of the molecule). Of the interactions that are
left, the one that gains the molecule the most energy is between the LUMO of the electrophile and the HOMO of the nucleophile. To make these orbitals as close as possible in
energy, we want the nucleophile to have a high-energy HOMO and the electrophile to have
a low-energy LUMO.

The very fi rst stage in understanding any reaction is to work out which of the reacting molecules is the nucleophile and which is the electrophile. It is impossible to stress too much how
important it is to be able to identify nucleophiles and electrophiles correctly. For this reason
we’ll now conduct an identity parade of each class. We’ll show you some of the top performing nucleophiles and top performing electrophiles, with a few comments on why they are so
good at what they do, before we move on to see them in action.

###### Identifying a nucleophile

Nucleophiles are either negatively charged or neutral species with a pair of electrons in a
high-energy orbital (the HOMO). The most common type of nucleophile has a non-bonding
**lone pair of electrons. Non-bonding electrons are typically high in energy because they do**
not benefi t from the stabilization bonding electrons get from being shared between two
nuclei. Typical neutral nucleophiles with lone pairs are ammonia, amines, water, and alcohols, all of which have lone pairs (one for N, two of equal energy for O) occupying sp[3]
orbitals.
Other atoms later in the periodic table which carry lone pairs, such as phosphines, thiols,
and sulfi des, also make good nucleophiles, especially since their lone pairs are of even higher
energy occupying orbitals made up of 3s and 3p atomic orbitals.

**Anions which have lone pairs are often good nucleophiles too, partly because they can**
be attracted electrostatically by positively charged electrophiles. The anionic centre is usually O, S, or halogen, each of which can have several identical lone pairs. For example,
hydroxide has three lone pairs—the negative charge cannot be assigned to one of them in
particular. It’s convenient just to draw the negative charge, and not the lone pairs as well.
Negative charges like this actually represent a pair of electrons—both the ‘extra’ electron
and its partner in the lone pair—so we normally write mechanisms with an arrow starting
on the negative charge.

The most important _carbon nucleophile with a lone pair of electrons is the cyanide ion._
Although linear cyanide (which is isoelectronic with N2 ) has a lone pair on nitrogen and a
lone pair on carbon, the nucleophilic atom is usually anionic carbon rather than neutral
nitrogen as the sp orbital on carbon is of higher energy than that on the more electronegative
nitrogen, and therefore constitutes the HOMO.


-----

Molecules can still be nucleophilic without non-bonding lone pairs. The next highest set of
orbitals are **bonding** π orbitals, especially C==C double bonds, since they are higher in
energy than σ orbitals (see p. 93). Simple alkenes are weakly nucleophilic and react with
strong electrophiles such as bromine. Note, however, that molecules with π bonds can also be
electrophiles, particularly when the π bond involves an electronegative atom. The only common π nucleophiles are alkenes and aromatic rings.
Finally, it is possible for the σ bond of a nucleophile to donate electrons, provided it is a σ
**bond associated with electropositive atoms such as B, Si, or the metals, along with C or H.**
You saw on p. 97 how the weak hold these atoms have over their electrons means that their
atomic orbitals (and hence the molecular orbitals they contribute to) are high in energy. You
met the borohydride anion BH4− in Chapter 4. Borohydride is a good nucleophile—it attacks
electrophilic carbonyl compounds, as you will see shortly. It donates electrons from its
HOMO, the B–H σ bond. Notice that in this case the negative charge does not represent a pair
of electrons: you cannot start a curly arrow from it.
In later chapters you will see organometallics—compounds with carbon–metal bonds, for
example methyllithium—acting as nucleophiles. They do so because the σ orbital generated
from electropositive C and even more electropositive Li is high in energy.

 - **Nucleophiles donate electrons from available, high-energy orbitals represented by one**
**of the following:**

**NH3** **Br** **H2C** **CH2** **Li** **CH3**

**a** σ **bond to an**
**a lone pair  a negative charge   a double bond electropositive atom**

The curly arrows in the box above represent electron movement away from the nucleophile.
But the electrons have to go somewehere: they are donated to an electrophile.

###### Identifying an electrophile

**Electrophiles are neutral or positively charged species with an empty atomic orbital (such**
as the empty p orbital in borane) or a low-energy antibonding orbital that can easily accept
electrons. The simplest electrophile is the hydrogen cation, H[+], usually named for what it is,
a proton. H[+] is a species without any electrons at all and a vacant, very low energy, 1s orbital. It
is so reactive that it is hardly ever found and almost any nucleophile will react with it. Acid solutions containing H[+] are neutralized by the nucleophile hydroxide, for example, and strong acid
goes on to protonate water as well, the water acting as a nucleophile and the proton as the
electrophile. The product is the hydronium ion, H3O[+], the true acidic species in all aqueous
strong acids. Here’s the reaction between hydroxide and H[+] with the electron movement from
the nucleophile to the electrophile represented by curly arrows. The arrows start on the
hydroxide’s negative charge, which represents one of the oxygen’s pairs of electrons:

Few organic compounds have vacant atomic orbitals and in most organic electrophiles
the LUMOs are instead **low-energy antibonding orbitals associated with electronegative**
**atoms. These antibonding orbitals can be either π* orbitals or σ* orbitals—in other words, mol-**
ecules which make good electrophiles might have a double or a single bond to an electronegative
atom such as O, N, Cl, or Br. It’s important that an electronegative atom is involved in order to
lower the energy of the orbital (see p. 96) and make it ready to accept electrons.

The most important molecules with a **double bond to an electronegative atom are**
carbonyl compounds. In fact carbonyl groups are the most important functional groups in
organic chemistry. We looked at their orbitals on p. 103 and we devote the next chapter,
Chapter 6, to a detailed study of their reactivity. The low-energy π* orbital is available to
accept electrons, and its electrophilicity is further enhanced by the partial positive charge
at carbon which arises from the C=O dipole. Here’s an example of a carbonyl compound,
acetone, reacting with an anionic nucleophile—we’ll choose borohydride in this case. Notice

This bar chart makes it clear why carbon is just so special: it can form strong bonds to almost anything, especially itself.
Elements at either end of the scale form weak bonds to similar elements (metal–metal bonds are weak, as are halogen–
halogen or O–O bonds), but elements in the middle can form strong bonds to other elements at either end of the scale
or elements in the middle. Being in the middle also gives C versatile reactivity: it is electrophilic when bonded to a more
electronegative element and nucleophilic when bonded to a more nucleophilic element.

The arrows showing electron movement are a little more involved this time, but the explanation is straightforward. The fi rst arrow shows the electrons moving from the nucleophile’s
HOMO (the B–H σ orbital) to the electrophile’s LUMO (the C=O π* orbital). The new feature
in this mechanism is a second arrow showing the electrons moving from the double bond
onto the oxygen atom. This is easy to explain. Since the reaction is putting electrons into an
_antibonding orbital (the π*), a bond has to break. That breaking bond is the C=O π bond (the_
σ bond remains intact). The electrons in the bond have to go somewhere and they end up as
an extra lone pair (represented by the negative charge) on oxygen. The product has a new C–H
σ bond in place of the C=O π bond.
Molecules with a single bond to electronegative atoms can also make good electrophiles.
In compounds such as HCl or CH3Br, the σ* orbital is low in energy because of the electrone gative Cl or Br (see p. 95) and the dipole attracts the electrons of the nucleophile to the
H or C atom.
Here’s an example of hydrogen chloride acting as an electrophile with ammonia as the
nucleophile. As with the carbonyl example above, we are putting electrons into an antibonding orbital, so a bond must break. This time the antibonding orbital is the H–Cl σ*, so the
bond which breaks is the H–Cl σ bond.

You may recognize this reaction, and the one on p. 113, as the reaction between a base and an acid. All acid–base
reactions are reactions between a nucleophile (the base) and an electrophile (the acid). We call an electrophile an acid
if is has an X–H bond (X being any atom) that loses H[+] in its reactions. We call a nucleophile a base when it uses a lone
pair to donate electrons to the X–H bond.
There is a little more to the defi nition of an acid, which we shall discuss in Chapter 8, where you will meet the term
‘Lewis acid’.


Some σ bonds are electrophilic even though they have no dipole at all. The bonds in the
halogens I2, Br2, and Cl2 are a case in point. Bromine, for example, is strongly electrophilic
because it has a weak Br–Br bond with a low energy σ* orbital. Why is the σ* low in energy?
Well, bromine is slightly electronegative, but it is also large: it has to use 4s and 4p atomic
orbitals for bonding, but these orbitals are large and diffuse, and overlap poorly, meaning
the σ* molecular orbital is not raised far in energy and can easily accept electrons.
How different the situation is with a C–C bond: C–C single bonds are almost never
electrophilic.

The unreactivity of C–C bonds is
why we think of structures in
terms of a hydrocarbon skeleton
and functional groups: the
hydrocarbon framework is made
up of strong C–C bonds with
unreactive low-energy fi lled and
high-energy empty orbitals, while
the functional groups tend to
involve electronegative and
electropositive atoms, which
react because they contribute to
more accessible low-energy
LUMOs or high-energy HOMOs.


Bromine reacts with many nucleophiles, for example in the reaction shown below between
a sulfi de and bromine. Lone pair electrons are donated from sulfur into the Br–Br σ* orbital,
which makes a new bond between S and Br, and breaks the old Br–Br bond.

###### Curly arrows represent reaction mechanisms

You have now seen several examples of curly arrows representing the movement of electrons
during a reaction, and it is time to discuss them in detail. It is no exaggeration to say that this
simple device is the one most powerful tool chemists have for explaining simply and accurately
how reactions work—in other words the mechanisms of reactions. Curly arrows are to reactions
what structural diagrams are to molecules. We discussed the guidelines for drawing structures
in Chapter 2, explaining that although the structure of a molecule may be very complex, a good
structural diagram will represent all of its important features without unnecessary detail. Curly
arrows are similar: you have seen how reactions involve the overlap and summation of molecular orbitals to make new molecular orbitals, and the movement of electrons within those orbitals. Curly arrows allow us to represent all the important features of those interactions and
electron movements very simply, without being concerned with unnecessary detail. It’s now
time to outline some guidelines for writing mechanisms with curly arrows.

###### Curly arrows show the movement of electrons

A curly arrow represents the movement of a pair of electrons from a fi lled orbital into an empty
orbital. You can think of the curly arrow as representing a pair of electrons thrown, like a


-----

climber’s grappling hook, across from where he is standing to where he wants to go. In the
simplest cases, the result of this movement is to form a bond between a nucleophile and an
electrophile. Here are two examples we have already seen in which lone pair electrons are
transferred to empty atomic orbitals.

as nucleophile σ bond

A curly arrow always starts with its tail resting on the symbol representing a pair of electrons in a fi lled orbital—in this case the lone pair or the negative charge (which actually
represents a lone pair). The head of the arrow indicates the fi nal destination of the pair of
electrons—the new bond between oxygen and hydrogen or oxygen and boron in these
examples. As we are forming a new bond, the head of the arrow should be drawn to a point
somewhere on the line between the two atoms.
Why does a curly arrow represent two electrons? Well, as you saw in Chapter 4, it takes
two electrons to make a bond, and in these two cases those electrons come from a lone pair.
We use a different sort of arrow for movements of one electron, as you will see in Chapters 24
and 37.
When the nucleophile attacks an antibonding orbital, such as the weak Br–Br bond we
have just been discussing, we need two arrows, one to make the new bond and one to break
the old.

**Me** **Me**

dimethyl sulfide

**S** **Br** **Br** **S** **Br** + **Br**

**Me** bromine as **Me**

σ bond

The bond-making arrow is the same as before—it starts on the nucleophile’s lone pair and
ends near the electrophile—but the bond-breaking arrow is new. This arrow shows that the
two electrons in the bond move to one end (a bromine atom) and turn it into an anion. As
always the arrow starts on something representing a pair of electrons in a fi lled orbital—the
Br–Br σ bond. It should start in the centre of the bond and its head should rest on the atom
(Br in this case) the electrons are heading for.
Another example is the attack of a base on the strong acid HBr.



- Some chemists prefer to place
this point halfway between the
atoms but we think it is clearer
and more informative if the
arrowhead is closer to the atom
to which the new bond is
forming. For these examples the
difference is minimal and either
method is completely clear, but
in more complex situations our
method prevents ambiguity, as
we shall see later. We shall
adopt this convention throughout
this book: that the arrow ends
close to the electrophile.

It is not important how much curvature you put into the arrows—as long as they curl
enough to distinguish them from straight reaction arrows, they can be as curly as you
like. Neither does it matter whether they go to the left or the right, or whether they curve up
or down as long as they begin and end in the right places. The mechanism below is just
as correct:



- Notice that the fi nal arrow
ends up delivering the electrons
to an electronegative atom,
satisfying its desire for electron
density. This is part of the
reason why double or single
bonds to electronegative atoms
are often a feature of good
electrophiles.

###### Charge is conserved in each step of a reaction

Charge cannot be created or destroyed. If the starting materials have no overall charge, then
neither must the products. In the last example above, it is obvious why the bromine becomes
negatively charged—it takes both electrons from the bond even though only one of them
formally ‘belongs’ to it. It may be less obvious to you why the ammonium cation has to have
a positive charge, but it must, in order to maintain overall neutrality. One way to think about
it is to note that both of the electrons in the new N–H bond come from N, so N is one electron
down on the deal.
If the starting materials are charged, then the products must have, overall, the same charge.
Here’s ammonia being protonated by H3O[+]—both starting materials and products must have
overall charge 1+.

When it is a π bond that is being broken rather than a σ bond, only the π bond is broken and
the σ bond should be left in place. This is what commonly happens when an electrophilic
carbonyl group is attacked by a nucleophile. Just as in the breaking of a σ bond, start the arrow
in the middle of the π bond and end by putting the arrowhead on the more electronegative
atom, in this case oxygen rather than carbon.


**HO** **O**

- We’ve drawn in the new
C–H bond in the product to
make it clear what has
happened in the reaction: there
are also two other C–H bonds
at this C atom, which as usual
we haven’t drawn in.


π bond is broken

In this case the starting materials had an overall negative charge and this is preserved
in the anionic product. The charge disappears from the hydroxide ion because it is now
sharing a pair of electrons with what was the carbonyl carbon atom and a charge appears
on what was the carbonyl oxygen atom because it now has one of the electrons in the old
π bond.

###### π bonds as nucleophiles

As you saw above, alkenes can be nucleophiles. The reaction of an alkene with HBr is a
simple example: the C–C π bond is the HOMO of the nucleophile. The fi rst arrow therefore
starts in the middle of the π bond and goes into the gap between one of the carbon atoms
and the hydrogen atom of HBr. The second arrow takes the electrons out of the H–Br σ
bond and puts them onto the bromine atom to make bromide ion. Overall charge is
conserved, so we must generate a positively charged species called a carbocation. The
carbocation has a positive charge and an empty p orbital (you can count the electrons to
make sure).

Notice that it was important to draw the two reagents in the right orientation since we need
the arrow to show which end of the alkene reacts with which end of HBr. If we had aligned
them differently we would have had trouble drawing the mechanism. Here is a less satisfactory representation, in which the H doesn’t seem to transfer to the correct end of the alkene:

**H** **Br** **H** + **Br**

If you fi nd yourself making an ambiguous drawing like this, it is worth having another go
to see if you can be clearer. When the nucleophile is a π (or σ) bond rather than a lone pair or
a charge there is always the question of which end of the bond actually reacts. One way to
make this clear is to draw an atom-specifi c curly arrow actually passing through the atom that
reacts. Something like this will do:

curly arrow passes through
atom forming new bond

**H**

**H** **Br** + **Br**

This reaction does not, in fact, stop here as the two ions produced now react with each other
to form the product of the reaction. The anion is the nucleophile and the carbocation, with
its empty p orbital, is the electrophile.

**Br** **Br**

###### σ bonds as nucleophiles

When σ bonds act as nucleophiles, the electrons also have to go to one end of the σ bond as
they form a new bond to the electrophile. We can return to an earlier example, the reaction
of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) with a carbonyl compound, and complete the mechanism. In
this example, one of the atoms (the hydrogen atom) moves away from the rest of the BH4
anion and becomes bonded to the carbonyl compound. The LUMO of the electrophile is, of
course, the π* orbital of the C=O double bond.



- In Chapter 19 we will
explain why the new C–H bond
forms at this end of the alkene.



- Notice the contrast with the
reaction of H3O[+] above: unlike
the O atom in H3O[+], the C atom
in the carbocation has only six
electrons and so can accept
two more.

The arrow from the nucleophile should start in the middle of the bond that breaks and show
which atom is transferred to the electrophile. You could use an atom-specifi c arrow if you
wanted to make it absolutely clear that the electrons in the σ bond act as a nucleophile through
the hydrogen and not through the boron atom:



- Remember (p. 115) you
can’t start a curly arrow on the
negative charge of BH4− because
it does not represent a lone pair:
all eight electrons around the
B atom are shown as the four
B–H bonds. This negative charge
is conceptually similar to the
positive charge of H3O[+], which
does not represent an empty
orbital. Contrast them with
the negative charge of HO[−]
(representing an sp[3] lone pair)
or the positive charge of H[+]
(representing the empty 1s
orbital).

The anion which forms is an intermediate, not the fi nal product. The reaction is often
carried out in water and the anion acts as a nucleophile to remove a proton from water. Water
is the electrophile: its LUMO is the O–H σ*.



- In common with some other
molecules, water can be either a
nucleophile or an electrophile. In
cases like this you can work out
which it must be by looking at
the other reagent: here, the
anion has to be a nucleophile.
Negatively charged molecules
are never electrophiles.

###### Drawing your own mechanisms with curly arrows

When you meet a new reaction, you must do two things:

**1.** identify which bonds have been formed and broken, and

**2.** decide which molecule is the nucleophile and which is the electrophile.

Once you have done that, you are well on the way to writing a reasonable mechanism
using curly arrows. We’ll take as an example the reaction of triphenylphosphine with
methyl iodide.

**MeI  +  Ph3P** **Ph3P** **Me** + **I**

First observe what has happened: a new bond has been formed between the phosphorus
atom and the methyl group, and the carbon–iodine bond has been broken. So we need to draw
the two reagents in such a way that a curly arrow can be used to represent this new bond.
You’ll also need to make sure that you draw out all of the bonds that are actually involved in
the reaction (too much detail is better than too little):

**Ph**


**P**

**Ph** **Ph**


**H3C** **I**


Now the all-important question: which is the nucleophile and which is the electrophile?
For the nucleophile we are looking for a high-energy pair of electrons such as a lone pair,
which the phosphorus has. Likewise, methyl iodide fi ts the bill as a plausible electrophile,
with its bond between C and an electronegative element (I). All that remains is to draw the
arrows. The fi rst one starts on the source of the electrons, the phosphorus lone pair, and fi nishes near the C atom to indicate the new P–C bond. The second one breaks the old C–I bond
and moves electrons onto the I atom.


**Ph**

**P**

**Ph** **Ph**


**Ph**

**H3C** **I** **Ph** **P** **CH3** [+ ]I

**Ph**


Admittedly, that was quite an easy mechanism to draw but you should still be pleased if you
succeeded at your fi rst try.

###### Watch out for fi ve-valent carbons

We now ought to spell out one thing that we have never stated but rather assumed. Most
atoms in stable organic molecules have a full complement of electrons (two in the case of
hydrogen, eight in the cases of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen) and so, if you make a new
bond to one of those elements, _you must also break an existing bond. Suppose you just_
‘added’ Ph3P to MeI in this last example without breaking the C–I bond: what would
happen?


**H**

**Ph3P** **H3C** **I** **Ph3P** **C** **I**

wrong mechanism × **H** **H**
impossible structure
carbon has five bonds


This structure must be wrong because carbon cannot have fi ve bonds—if it did it would
have ten electrons in the 2s and the three 2p orbitals. Four orbitals can contain only eight
electrons.



- **B, C, N, and O never have more than four bonds. If you make a new bond to uncharged H, C,**
**N, or O you must also break one of the existing bonds in the same step.**


###### Mechanisms with several steps

At the beginning of the chapter, we mentioned the fact that carbonyl compounds react with
cyanide. We are now going to deduce a mechanism. This is the reaction:


**O**


**NaCN** **HO** **CN**


**H**


**H**


**H2O**


We must decide what happens. NaCN is an ionic solid so the true reagent must be cyanide
ion, whose structure was discussed on p. 112. As it is an anion, it must be the nucleophile and
the carbonyl group must be the electrophile. Starting the arrow on the nucleophile’s negative
charge and heading for the C=O group, and then using a second arrow to break the C=O
bond gives us this:


**O**


**O** **CN**

**H**


**H**


**C** **N**


This is a good mechanism but it doesn’t quite produce the product. There must be a second
step in which the anionic oxygen picks up a proton from somewhere. The only source of
protons is the solvent, water, so we can write the full mechanism in one sequence:


**H**


**O** **CN**

**H**


**O**


**O**

**HO** **CN**

Try a more complicated example: primary alcohols can be converted into symmetrical
ethers in acid solution. Suggest a mechanism for this acid-catalysed conversion of one functional group into another.


**H**

**OH** **O**

ethanol diethyl ether


-----

The acid must do something, so we need to start with the reaction between ethanol and
H[+]. H[+] has to be an electrophile, so the nucleophile must be ethanol, using its HOMO, one
of the O lone pairs, as the source of electrons. The fi rst intermediate we get is called an
oxonium ion.
The positively charged oxonium ion has to be the electrophile in the second step of the reaction, and the only possible nucleophile is another molecule of ethanol. But how do they react?
It’s tempting to allow the ethanol’s lone pair to attack the positively charged oxygen atom, but
that would give us an oxygen atom with ten electrons—as with H3O[+] this positive charge is not
an empty orbital. Attacking the H–O bond is a good alternative, but that just takes us back to
where we started.

You might well protest that you don’t know anything about the chemistry of either of the
functional groups, the thiol or the cyclic ether. Be that as it may, you can still draw a mechanism. Ask fi rst of all: which bonds have been formed and which broken? Clearly the S–H bond
has been broken and a new S–C bond formed. The three-membered ring has gone by the
cleavage of one of the C–O bonds. The main chain of carbon atoms is unchanged. All this is
sketched in the diagram in the margin. We suggest you now cover the rest of this page and try
to work out a mechanism yourself before reading further.
The hydroxide must do something, and since it is negatively charged, a reasonable starting
point is going to be to use it as a nucleophile to break the S–H bond. Hydroxide is after all a
base; it likes to remove protons. So here’s the fi rst step:


oxonium ion **H**


**H**


**O**


What we need is a new C–O bond, so the lone pair must attack at carbon, putting electrons
into the C–O σ* and expelling a molecule of water. Here’s the full mechanism. The last step
is loss of the proton to give the ether.

Your mechanism possibly didn’t look as neat as the printed version, but if you got it roughly
right, you should be proud. This is a three-step mechanism involving chemistry that is new to
you and yet you could draw a mechanism for it.

###### Curly arrows are vital for learning organic chemistry

Curly arrows can be used to explain the interaction between the structure of reactants and
products, and their reactivity in the vast majority of organic reactions, regardless of their
complexity. When used correctly they can even be used to predict possible outcomes of
unknown processes and hence to design new synthetic reactions. They are a powerful tool for
understanding and developing organic chemistry and it is vital that you become profi cient in
their use. They are the dynamic language of organic reaction mechanisms and they will
appear in every chapter of the book from now on.
Another equally important reason for mastering curly arrows now, as we start the systematic study of different types of reactions, is that the seemingly vast number of ‘different
reactions’ turn out not to be so vast after all. Most organic reactions involve the movement
of pairs of electrons between nucleophiles and electrophiles. And with relatively few types
of organic nucleophiles and electrophiles involved in all these reactions, the similarity
between seemingly unrelated reactions will become immediately apparent if you understand
and can draw mechanisms. Learning to draw mechanisms means you can understand groups
of related reactions rather than having to learn them individually.
Drawing curly arrow mechanisms is a bit like riding a bike. Before you’ve mastered the skill,
you keep falling off. Once you’ve mastered the skill, it seems so straightforward that you wonder how you ever did without it. You’ll come across busy streets and complex traffi c junctions,
but with care you’ll get through safely.

###### Step-by-step guide to drawing mechanisms with curly arrows

If you still feel you are at the wobbly stage, and need a helping hand, this step-by-step guide
may help you. You’ll soon fi nd you won’t need to follow it through in detail.

**1.** Draw out the reagents as clear structures following the guidelines in Chapter 2. Check
that you understand what the reagents and the solvent are under the conditions
of the reaction, for example if the reaction is in a base, will one of the compounds
exist as an anion?

**2.** Inspect the starting materials and the products, and assess what has happened in the
reaction. What new bonds have been formed? What bonds have been broken? Has
anything been added or removed? Have any bonds moved around the molecule?

**3.** Identify the nucleophilic centres in all the reactant molecules and decide which is the
most nucleophilic. Then identify the electrophiles present and again decide which is
the most electrophilic.

**4.** If the combination of these two centres appears to lead to the product, draw the
reactants, complete with charges, so as to position the nucleophilic and electrophilic
centres within bonding distance, ensuring that the angle of attack of the nucleophile
is more or less consistent with the orbitals involved.

**5.** Draw a curly arrow from the nucleophile to the electrophile. It must start on a
representation of electrons—a fi lled orbital or negative charge (show this clearly by
just touching the bond or charge)—and fi nish where the electrons are heading for
(show this clearly by the position of the head).



- We will generally show
mechanisms using black arrows
on red diagrams but the only
point of that is to make the
arrows stand out. We suggest
that when you write
mechanisms you consider using
a colour for your arrows that
contrasts with the structures.


-----

**6.** Consider whether any atom that has been changed now has too many bonds; if so
one of them must be broken to avoid absurd structures. Select a bond to break. Draw a
curly arrow from the centre of the chosen bond, the fi lled orbital, and terminate it in
a suitable place, such as an electronegative atom.

**7.** Write out the structures of the products specifi ed by the curly arrows. Break the bonds
that are the sources of the arrows and make those that are the targets. Consider the
effect on the charges on individual atoms and check that the overall charge is not
changed. Once you have drawn the curly arrows, the structure of the products is
already decided and there is no room for any further decisions. Just write what the
curly arrows tell you. If the structure is wrong, then the curly arrows were wrong so
go back and change them.

**8.** Repeat stages 5–7 as required to produce a stable product.

Now you have met the language of mechanism it’s time to look in detail at the reactions of
some functional groups, and we start with the most important functional group of all, the
carbonyl group.

###### Molecular orbitals explain the reactivity of the carbonyl group

We are now going to leave to one side most of the reactions you met in the last chapter—we
will come back to them all again later in the book. In this chapter we are going to concentrate
on just one of them—probably the simplest of all organic reactions—the addition of a nucleophile to a carbonyl group. The carbonyl group, as found in aldehydes, ketones, and many
other compounds, is without doubt the most important functional group in organic chemistry, and that is another reason why we have chosen it as our fi rst topic for more detailed study.
You met nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group on pp. 115 and 121, where we showed
you how cyanide reacts with aldehydes to give an alcohol. As a reminder, here is the reaction
again, this time with a ketone, with its mechanism.

- **Additions to carbonyl groups generally consist of two mechanistic steps:**

**•** **nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group**

**•** **protonation of the anion that results.**


The addition step is more important, and it forms a new C–C σ bond at the expense of the
C=O π bond. The protonation step makes the overall reaction addition of HCN across the
C=O π bond.
Why does cyanide, in common with many other nucleophiles, attack the carbonyl group?
And why does it attack the carbon atom of the carbonyl group? To answer these questions we
need to look in detail at the structure of carbonyl compounds in general and the orbitals of
the C=O group in particular.
The carbonyl double bond, like that found in alkenes (whose bonding we discussed in
Chapter 4), consists of two parts: one σ bond and one π bond. The σ bond between the two sp[2]
hybridized atoms—carbon and oxygen—is formed from two sp[2] orbitals. The other sp[2] orbitals on carbon form the two σ bonds to the substituents while those on oxygen are fi lled by the
two lone pairs. The sp[2] hybridization means that the carbonyl group has to be planar, and the
angle between the substituents is close to 120°. The diagram illustrates all this for the simplest
carbonyl compound, formaldehyde (or methanal, CH2O). The π bond then results from overlap of the remaining p orbitals—again, you can see this for formaldehyde in the diagram.

When we introduced the bonding in the carbonyl group in Chapter 4 we explained how
polarization in the π bond means it is skewed towards oxygen, because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. Conversely, the unfi lled π* antibonding orbital is skewed in the
opposite direction, with a larger coeffi cient at the carbon atom. This is quite hard to represent
with the π bond represented as a single unit, as shown above, but becomes easier to visualize
if instead we represent the π and π* orbitals using individual p orbitals on C and O. The diagrams in the margin show the π and π* orbitals represented in this way.


Because there are two types of bonding between C and O, the C=O double bond is rather
shorter than a typical C–O single bond, and also over twice as strong—so why is it so reactive? Polarization is the key. The polarized C=O bond gives the carbon atom some degree of
positive charge, and this charge attracts negatively charged nucleophiles (like cyanide) and
encourages reaction. The polarization of the antibonding π* orbital towards carbon is also


-----

important because, when the carbonyl group reacts with a nucleophile, electrons move from
the HOMO of the nucleophile (an sp orbital in the case of cyanide) into the LUMO of the
electrophile—in other words the π* orbital of the C=O bond. The greater coeffi cient of the
π* orbital at carbon means a better HOMO–LUMO interaction, so this is where the nucleophile attacks.
As our nucleophile—which we are representing here as ‘Nu[−]’—approaches the carbon atom,
the electron pair in its HOMO starts to interact with the LUMO (antibonding π*) to form a new
σ bond. Filling antibonding orbitals breaks bonds and, as the electrons enter the antibonding
π* of the carbonyl group, the π bond is broken, leaving only the C–O σ bond intact. But electrons can’t just vanish, and those that were in the π bond move off on to the electronegative
oxygen, which ends up with the negative charge that started on the nucleophile. You can see
all this happening in the diagram below.



- The HOMO of the nucleophile
will depend on what the
nucleophile is, and we will meet
examples in which it is an sp or
sp[3] orbital containing a lone
pair, or a B–H σ orbital or
metal–carbon σ orbital. We shall
shortly discuss cyanide as the
nucleophile; cyanide’s HOMO is
an sp orbital on carbon.

Notice how the trigonal, planar sp[2] hybridized carbon atom of the carbonyl group
changes to a tetrahedral, sp[3] hybridized state in the product. For each class of nucleophile
you meet in this chapter, we will show you the HOMO–LUMO interaction involved in the
addition reaction. These interactions also show you how the orbitals of the starting materials change into the orbitals of the product as they combine. Most importantly here, the lone
pair of the nucleophile combines with the π* of the carbonyl group to form a new σ bond in
the product.

###### Attack of cyanide on aldehydes and ketones

Now that we’ve looked at the theory of how a nucleophile attacks a carbonyl group, let’s
go back to the real reaction with which we started this chapter: cyanohydrin formation
from a carbonyl compound and sodium cyanide. Cyanide contains sp hybridized C and N
atoms, and its HOMO is an sp orbital on carbon. The reaction is a typical nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group: the electron pair from the HOMO of the CN[−] (an sp orbital
on carbon) moves into the C=O π* orbital; the electrons from the C=O π orbital move on to
the oxygen atom. The reaction is usually carried out in the presence of acid, which protonates the resulting alkoxide to give the hydroxyl group of the composite functional
group known as a cyanohydrin. The reaction works with both ketones and aldehydes, and
the mechanism below shows the reaction of a general aldehyde. This reaction appeared fi rst
in Chapter 5.

Cyanohydrin formation is reversible: just dissolving a cyanohydrin in water can give back
the aldehyde or ketone you started with, and aqueous base usually decomposes cyanohydrins
completely. This is because cyanide is a good leaving group—we’ll come back to this type of
reaction in more detail in Chapter 10.

Cyanohydrin formation is therefore an equilibrium between starting materials and
products, and we can get good yields only if the equilibrium favours the products. The
equilibrium is more favourable for aldehyde cyanohydrins than for ketone cyanohydrins,
and the reason is the size of the groups attached to the carbonyl carbon atom. As the carbonyl carbon atom changes from sp[2] to sp[3], its bond angles change from about 120° to


-----

about 109°—in other words, the substituents it carries move closer together. This reduction
in bond angle is not a problem for aldehydes, because one of the substituents is just a (very
small) hydrogen atom, but for ketones, especially ones that carry larger alkyl groups, this
effect can disfavour the addition reaction. Effects that result from the size of substituents
and the repulsion between them are called steric effects, and we call the repulsive force
experienced by large substituents steric hindrance. Steric hindrance (not ‘hinderance’)
is a consequence of repulsion between the electrons in all the fi lled orbitals of the alkyl
substituents.


###### Steric hindrance

The size of substituents plays a role in very many organic reactions—it’s the reason aldehydes (with an H next to the
C=O group) are more reactive than ketones, for example. Steric hindrance affects reaction rates, but also makes molecules react by completely different mechanisms, as you will see in the substitution reactions in Chapter 15. You will need
to get used to thinking about whether the presence of large substituents, with all their fi lled C–H and C–C bonds, is a
factor in determining how well a reaction will go.


###### The angle of nucleophilic attack on aldehydes and ketones

Having introduced you to the sequence of events that makes up a nucleophilic attack at C=O
(interaction of HOMO with LUMO, formation of new σ bond, breakage of π bond), we should
now tell you a little more about the direction from which the nucleophile approaches the carbonyl group. Not only do nucleophiles always attack carbonyl groups at carbon, but they also
always approach from a particular angle. You may at fi rst be surprised by this angle, since
nucleophiles attack not from a direction perpendicular to the plane of the carbonyl group but
at about 107° to the C=O bond—close to the angle at which the new bond will form. This
approach route is known as the Bürgi–Dunitz trajectory after the authors of the elegant crystallographic methods that revealed it. You can think of the angle of attack as the result of a
compromise between maximum orbital overlap of the HOMO with π* and minimum repulsion of the HOMO by the electron density in the carbonyl π bond. But a better explanation is
that π* does not have parallel atomic orbitals as there is a node halfway down the bond
(Chapter 4) so the atomic orbitals are already at an angle. The nucleophile attacks along the
axis of the larger orbital in the HOMO.


We pointed this out in Chapter
4 on p. 104.

Any other portions of the molecule that get in the way of (or, in other words, that cause steric
_hindrance to) the Bürgi–Dunitz trajectory will greatly reduce the rate of addition and this is_
another reason why aldehydes are more reactive than ketones. The importance of the Bürgi–
Dunitz trajectory will become more evident later, particularly in Chapter 33.


Bürgi and Dunitz deduced this trajectory by examining crystal structures of compounds containing both a nucleophilic
nitrogen atom and an electrophilic carbonyl group. They found that, when the two got close enough to interact, but were
not free to undergo reaction, the nitrogen atom always lay on or near the 107° trajectory described here. Theoretical
calculations later gave the same 107° value for the optimum angle of attack.


###### Nucleophilic attack by ‘hydride’ on aldehydes and ketones

Nucleophilic attack by the hydride ion, H[−], is an almost unknown reaction. This species,
which is present in the salt sodium hydride, NaH, has such a high charge density that it only
ever reacts as a base. The reason is that its fi lled 1s orbital is of an ideal size to interact with the
hydrogen atom’s contribution to the σ* orbital of an H–X bond (X can be any atom), but much
too small to interact easily with carbon’s more diffuse 2p orbital contribution to the LUMO
(π*) of the C=O group.

Nevertheless, adding H[−] to the carbon atom of a C=O group would be a very useful reaction,
as the result would be the formation of an alcohol. This process would involve going down
from the aldehyde or ketone oxidation level to the alcohol oxidation level (Chapter 2, p. 32)
and would therefore be a reduction. It cannot be done with NaH, but it can be done with some
other compounds containing nucleophilic hydrogen atoms.

The most important of these compounds is sodium borohydride, NaBH4. This is a watersoluble salt containing the tetrahedral BH4− anion, which is isoelectronic with methane but
has a negative charge since boron has one less proton in the nucleus than does carbon.


-----

In Chapter 4 we looked at isoelectronic borane BH3 and the cation CH3+. Here we have effectively added a hydride ion to each of them.
But beware! Remember (p. 115) there is no lone pair on boron: you must not draw an arrow
coming out of this negative charge to form another bond. If you did, you would get a pentacovalent B(V) compound, which would have ten electrons in its outer shell. Such a thing is
impossible with a fi rst-row element as there are only four available orbitals (1 × 2s and 3 × 2p).
Instead, since all of the electrons (including those represented by the negative charge) are in
B–H σ orbitals, it is from a B–H bond that we must start any arrow to indicate reaction of BH4−
as a nucleophile. By transferring this pair of electrons we make the boron atom neutral—it is
now trivalent with just six electrons.

What happens when we carry out this reaction using a carbonyl compound as the electrophile? The hydrogen atom, together with the pair of electrons from the B–H bond, will be
transferred to the carbon atom of the C=O group. Although no hydride ion, H[−], is actually
involved in the reaction, the transfer of a hydrogen atom with an attached pair of electrons
can be regarded as a ‘hydride transfer’. You will often see it described this way in books. But
be careful not to confuse BH4− with the hydride ion itself. To make it quite clear that it is the
hydrogen atom that is forming the new bond to C, this reaction may also be helpfully represented with a curly arrow passing through the hydrogen atom.

You met this reaction in Chapter 5 but there is more to say about it. The oxyanion produced
in the fi rst step can help stabilize the electron-defi cient BH3 molecule by adding to its empty
p orbital. Now we have a tetravalent boron anion again, which could transfer a second hydrogen atom (with its pair of electrons) to another molecule of aldehyde.

This process can continue so that, in principle, all four hydrogen atoms could be transferred
to molecules of aldehyde. In practice the reaction is rarely as effi cient as that, but aldehydes
and ketones are usually reduced in good yield to the corresponding alcohol by sodium borohydride in water or alcoholic solution. The water or alcohol solvent provides the proton
needed to form the alcohol from the alkoxide.

Sodium borohydride is one of the weaker hydride donors. The fact that it can be used in water
is evidence of this: more powerful hydride donors such as lithium aluminium hydride, LiAlH4,
react violently with water. Sodium borohydride reacts with both aldehydes and ketones,
although the reaction with ketones is slower: for example, benzaldehyde is reduced about 400
times faster than acetophenone in isopropanol. This is because of steric hindrance (see above).
Sodium borohydride does not react at all with less reactive carbonyl compounds such as
esters or amides: if a molecule contains both an aldehyde and an ester, only the aldehyde will
be reduced.

###### Addition of organometallic reagents to aldehydes and ketones

Organometallic compounds have a carbon–metal bond. Lithium and magnesium are very
electropositive metals, and the Li–C or Mg–C bonds in organolithium or organomagnesium
reagents are highly polarized towards carbon. They are therefore very powerful nucleophiles,
and attack the carbonyl group to give alcohols, forming a new C–C bond. For our fi rst example,
we shall take one of the simplest of organolithiums, methyllithium, which is commercially
available as a solution in Et2O, shown here reacting with an aldehyde. The orbital diagram of
the addition step shows how the polarization of the C–Li bond means that it is the carbon atom
of the nucleophile that attacks the carbon atom of the electrophile and we get a new C–C bond.
We explained on p. 113 the polarization of bonds between carbon and more electropositive
elements. The relevant electronegativities are C 2.5, Li 1.0, and Mg 1.2 so both metals are much
more electropositive than carbon. The orbitals of MeLi are discussed in Chapter 4.

The course of the reaction is much the same as you have seen before, but we need to highlight a few points where this reaction scheme differs from those you have met earlier in the
chapter. First of all, notice the legend ‘1. MeLi, THF; 2. H2O’. This means that, fi rst, MeLi is
added to the aldehyde in a THF solvent. Reaction occurs: MeLi adds to the aldehyde to give an
alkoxide. Then (and only then) water is added to protonate the alkoxide. The ‘2. H2O’ means
that water is added in a separate step only when all the MeLi has reacted: it is not present at
the start of the reaction as it was in the cyanide reaction and some of the borohydride addition
reactions. In fact, water must not be present during the addition of MeLi (or of any other organometallic reagent) to a carbonyl group because water destroys organometallics very rapidly


-----

by protonating them to give alkanes (organolithiums and organomagnesiums are strong
bases as well as powerful nucleophiles). The addition of water, or sometimes dilute acid or
ammonium chloride, at the end of the reaction is known as the work-up.
Because they are so reactive, organolithiums are usually used at low temperature, often
–78 °C (the sublimation temperature of solid CO2), in aprotic solvents such as Et2O or THF.
Protic solvents such as water or alcohols have acidic protons but aprotic solvents such as ether
do not. Organolithiums also react with oxygen, so they have to be handled under a dry, inert

reagents include n-butyllithium and phenyllithium, and they react with both aldehydes and
ketones. Note that addition to an aldehyde gives a secondary alcohol while addition to a
ketone gives a tertiary alcohol.

###### Low-temperature baths

Cooling reaction mixtures is generally the job of a cooling bath of ice and water for around 0 °C, or baths of solid CO2
in organic solvents such as acetone or ethanol down to about –78 °C. Small pieces of solid CO2 are added slowly to the
solvent until vigorous bubbling ceases. Few chemists then measure the temperature of the bath, which may be anywhere
from –50 to –80 °C. The temperature given in publications is often –78 °C, about the lower limit. Lower temperatures
require liquid nitrogen. Practical handbooks give details.

Organomagnesium reagents known as Grignard reagents (RMgX) react in a similar way.
Some simple Grignard reagents, such as methyl magnesium chloride, MeMgCl, and phenyl
magnesium bromide, PhMgBr, are commercially available, and the scheme shows PhMgBr
reacting with an aldehyde. The reactions of these two classes of organometallic reagent—
organolithiums and Grignard reagents—with carbonyl compounds are among the most
important ways of making carbon–carbon bonds, and we will consider them in more detail
in Chapter 9.

###### Addition of water to aldehydes and ketones

Nucleophiles don’t have to be highly polarized or negatively charged to react with aldehydes
and ketones: neutral ones will as well. How do we know? This [13]C NMR spectrum was obtained
by dissolving formaldehyde, H2C=O, in water. You will remember from Chapter 3 that the
carbon atoms of carbonyl groups give [13]C signals typically in the region of 150–200 ppm. So
where is formaldehyde’s carbonyl peak? Instead we have a signal at 83 ppm—where we would
expect tetrahedral carbon atoms singly bonded to oxygen to appear.

This reaction, like the addition of cyanide we discussed at the beginning of the chapter, is
an equilibrium, and is quite general for aldehydes and ketones. But, as with the cyanohydrins,
the position of the equilibrium depends on the structure of the carbonyl compound.
Generally, the same steric factors (p. 129) mean that simple aldehydes are hydrated to some
extent while simple ketones are not. However, special factors can shift the equilibrium
towards the hydrated form even for ketones, particularly if the carbonyl compound is reactive
or unstable.
Formaldehyde is an extremely reactive aldehyde as it has no substituents to hinder attack—it
is so reactive that it is rather prone to polymerization. And it is quite happy to move from sp[2]
to sp[3] hybridization because there is very little increased steric hindrance between the two
hydrogen atoms as the bond angle changes from 120° to 109° (p. 129). This is why our aqueous
solution of formaldehyde contains essentially no CH2O—it is completely hydrated. A mechanism for the hydration reaction is shown below. Notice how a proton has to be transferred
from one oxygen atom to the other, mediated by water molecules.

Formaldehyde reacts with water so readily because its substituents are very small: a steric
effect. Electronic effects can also favour reaction with nucleophiles—electronegative atoms
such as halogens attached to the carbon atoms next to the carbonyl group can increase the
extent of hydration by the inductive effect according to the number of halogen substituents and their electron-withdrawing power. They increase the polarization of the carbonyl
group, which already has a positively polarized carbonyl carbon, and make it even more
prone to attack by water. Trichloroacetaldehyde (chloral, Cl3CHO) is hydrated completely
in water, and the product ‘chloral hydrate’ can be isolated as crystals and is an anaesthetic.
You can see this quite clearly in the two IR spectra below. The fi rst one is a spectrum of
chloral hydrate from a bottle—notice there is no strong absorption between 1700 and
1800 cm[−][1] (where we would expect C=O to appear) and instead we have the tell-tale broad
O–H peak at 3400 cm[−][1]. Heating drives off the water, and the second IR spectrum is of the
resulting dry chloral: the C=O peak has reappeared at 1770 cm[−][1] and the O–H peak has
gone.

**affects the distribution of electrons in π bonds and is discussed in the next chapter.**

Cyclopropanones—three-membered ring ketones—are also hydrated to a signifi cant
extent, but for a different reason. You saw earlier how acyclic ketones suffer increased steric
hindrance when the bond angle changes from 120° to 109° on moving from sp[2] to sp[3]
hybridization. Cyclopropanones (and other small-ring ketones) conversely prefer the small
bond angle because their substituents are already confi ned within a ring. Look at it this way:
a three-membered ring is really very strained, with bond angles forced to be 60°. For the sp[2]
hybridized ketone this means bending the bonds 60° away from their ‘natural’ 120°. But for
the sp[3] hybridized hydrate the bonds have to be distorted by only 49° (= 109° – 60°). So addition to the C=O group allows some of the strain inherent in the small ring to be released—
hydration is favoured, and indeed cyclopropanone and cyclobutanone are very reactive
electrophiles.

- **The same structural features that favour or disfavour hydrate formation are important in**

**are reversible or not. Steric hindrance and more alkyl substituents make carbonyl compounds less**
**reactive towards any nucleophile; electron-withdrawing groups and small rings make them more**

###### Hemiacetals from reaction of alcohols with aldehydes and ketones

Since water adds to (at least some) carbonyl compounds, it should come as no surprise that
alcohols do too. The product of the reaction is known as a hemiacetal, because it is halfway to

an acetal, a functional group that you met in Chapter 2 (p. 32) and that will be discussed in
detail in Chapter 11. The mechanism follows in the footsteps of hydrate formation: just use

In the mechanism above, as in the mechanism of hydrate formation on p. 134, a proton has
to be transferred between one oxygen atom and the other. We have shown a molecule of ethanol (or water) doing this, but it is impossible to defi ne exactly the path taken by any one proton as it transfers between the oxygen atoms. It might not even be the same proton: another
possible mechanism is shown below on the left, where a molecule of ethanol simultaneously
gives away one proton and takes another. In the simplest case, the proton just hops from one
oxygen to another, as shown in the right, and there is no shame in writing this mechanism:
it is no more or less correct than the others.

**Intermolecular reactions occur**
between two molecules.
**Intra molecular reactions occur**
within the same molecule. We
shall discuss the reasons why
intramolecular reactions are more
favourable and why cyclic hemiacetals and acetals are more stable in Chapters 11 and 12.


What is certain is that proton transfers between oxygen atoms are very fast and are reversible, and for that reason we don’t need to be concerned with the details—the proton can
always get to where it needs to be for the next step of the mechanism. As with all these carbonyl group reactions, what is really important is the addition step, not what happens to the
protons.
Hemiacetal formation is reversible, and hemiacetals are stabilized by the same special
structural features as those of hydrates. However, hemiacetals can also gain stability by
being cyclic—when the carbonyl group and the attacking hydroxyl group are part of the
same molecule. The reaction is now an intramolecular (within the same molecule) addition, as opposed to the intermolecular (between two molecules) ones we have considered
so far.

Although the cyclic hemiacetal (also called lactol) product is more stable, it is still in equilibrium with some of the open-chain hydroxyaldehyde form. Its stability, and how easily it


-----

forms, depends on the size of the ring: fi ve- and six-membered rings are free from strain (their
bonds are free to adopt 109° or 120° angles—compare the three-membered rings on p. 135),
and fi ve- or six-membered hemiacetals are common. Among the most important examples are
many sugars. Glucose, for example, is a hydroxyaldehyde that exists mainly as a six-membered
cyclic hemiacetal (>99% of glucose is cyclic in solution), while ribose exists as a fi ve-membered cyclic hemiacetal.

###### Ketones also form hemiacetals


Hydroxyketones can also form hemiacetals but, as you should expect, they usually do so less
readily than hydroxyaldehydes. But we know that this hydroxyketone must exist as the cyclic
hemiacetal as it has no C=O stretch in its IR spectrum. The reason? The hydroxyketone is
already cyclic, with the OH group poised to attack the ketone—it can’t get away so cyclization
is highly favoured.

###### Acid and base catalysis of hemiacetal and hydrate formation

In Chapter 8 we shall look in detail at acids and bases, but at this point we need to tell
you about one of their important roles in chemistry: they act as catalysts for a number of
carbonyl addition reactions, among them hemiacetal and hydrate formation. To see why,
we need to look back at the mechanisms of hemiacetal formation on p. 138 and hydrate
formation on p. 134. Both involve proton-transfer steps, which we can choose to draw
like this:

ethanol acting as a base **HOEt** ethanol acting as an acid

**H**

**Et**

**O** **O** **EtO** **O** **OEt**

**H**

**R** **H** **R** **H**


In the fi rst proton-transfer step, ethanol acts as a base, removing a proton; in the second it
acts as an acid, donating a proton. You saw in Chapter 5 how water can also act as an acid or
a base. Strong acids or strong bases (for example HCl or NaOH) increase the rate of hemiacetal
or hydrate formation because they allow these proton-transfer steps to occur before the addition to the carbonyl group.
In acid (dilute HCl, say), the mechanism is different in detail. The fi rst step is now protonation of the carbonyl group’s lone pair: the positive charge makes it much more electrophilic


-----

so the addition reaction is faster. Notice how the proton added at the beginning is lost again
at the end—it is really a catalyst.



- In acid it is also possible for
the hemiacetal to react further
with the alcohol to form an
acetal, but this is dealt with in
Chapter 11 and need not
concern you at present.

The mechanism in basic solution is slightly different again. The fi rst step is now deprotonation of the ethanol by hydroxide, which makes the addition reaction faster by making the
ethanol more nucleophilic. Again, base (hydroxide) is regenerated in the last step, making the
overall reaction catalytic in base.

- As you will see in Chapter
11, the reaction in base always
stops with the hemiacetal—
acetals never form in base.

The fi nal step could equally well involve deprotonation of ethanol to give alkoxide—and
alkoxide could equally well do the job of catalysing the reaction. In fact, you will often come
across mechanisms with the base represented just as ‘B[−]’ because it doesn’t matter what the
base is.



- **For nucleophilic additions to carbonyl groups:**

**•** **acid catalysts work by making the carbonyl group more electrophilic**

**•** **base catalysts work by making the nucleophile more nucleophilic**

**•** **both types of catalysts are regenerated at the end of the reaction.**

###### Bisulfi te addition compounds

The last nucleophile of this chapter, sodium bisulfi te (NaHSO3) adds to aldehydes and some
ketones to give what is usually known as a **bisulfi te addition compound. The reaction**
occurs by nucleophilic attack of a lone pair on the carbonyl group, just like the attack of
cyanide. This leaves a positively charged sulfur atom but a simple proton transfer leads to the
product.

The products are useful for two reasons. They are usually crystalline and so can be used to
purify liquid aldehydes by recrystallization. This is of value only because this reaction, like


-----

several you have met in this chapter, is reversible. The bisulfi te compounds are made by mixing the aldehyde or ketone with saturated aqueous sodium bisulfi te in an ice bath, shaking,
and crystallizing. After purifi cation the bisulfi te addition compound can be hydrolysed back
to the aldehyde in dilute aqueous acid or base.

The reversibility of the reaction makes bisulfi te compounds useful intermediates in the
synthesis of other adducts from aldehydes and ketones. For example, one practical method for
making cyanohydrins involves bisulfi te compounds. The famous practical book ‘Vogel’ suggests reacting acetone fi rst with sodium bisulfi te and then with sodium cyanide to give a good
yield (70%) of the cyanohydrin.



- The structure of NaHSO3,
sodium bisulfi te, is rather
curious. It is an oxyanion of a
sulfur(IV) compound with a lone
pair of electrons—the HOMO—
on the sulfur atom, but the
charge is formally on the more
electronegative oxygen. As a
‘second-row’ element (second
row of the periodic table, that is)
sulfur can have more than just
eight electrons—it’s all right to
have four, fi ve, or six bonds to S
or P, unlike, say, B or O. Secondrow elements have d orbitals as
well as s and p so they can
accommodate more electrons.

**O** **2. NaCN**

**HO** **CN**


**Me** **Me** **Me** **Me**

What is happening here? The bisulfi te compound forms fi rst, but only as an intermediate on
the route to the cyanohydrin. When the cyanide is added, reversing the formation of the
bisulfi te compound provides the single proton necessary to give back the hydroxyl group at
the end of the reaction. No dangerous HCN is released (always a hazard when cyanide ions
and acid are present together).

The second reason that bisulfi te compounds are useful is that they are soluble in water. Some
small (that is, low molecular weight) aldehydes and ketones are water-soluble—acetone is an
example. But most larger (more than four or so carbon atoms) aldehydes and ketones are not.


-----

This does not usually matter to most chemists as we often want to carry out reactions in
organic solvents rather than water. But it can matter to medicinal chemists, who make compounds that need to be compatible with biological systems. And in one case, the solubility of
bisulfi te adduct in water is literally vital.
Dapsone is an antileprosy drug. It is a very effective one too, especially when used in combination with two other drugs in a ‘cocktail’ that can be simply drunk as an aqueous solution
by patients in tropical countries without any special facilities, even in the open air. But there
is a problem! Dapsone is insoluble in water. The solution is to make a bisulfi te compound from
it. You may ask how this is possible since dapsone has no aldehyde or ketone—just two amino
groups and a sulfone. The trick is to use the formaldehyde bisulfi te compound and exchange
the OH group for one of the amino groups in dapsone.

Now the compound will dissolve in water and release dapsone inside the patient. The details
of this sort of chemistry will come in Chapter 11, when you will meet imines as intermediates.
But at this stage we just want you to appreciate that even the relatively simple chemistry in
this chapter is useful in synthesis, in commerce, and in medicine.

###### Introduction

As you look around you, you will be aware of many different colours—from the greens and
browns outside to the bright blues and reds of the clothes you are wearing. All these colours
result from the interaction of light with the pigments in these different things—some frequencies of light are absorbed, others scattered. Inside our eyes, chemical reactions detect
these different frequencies and convert them into electrical nerve impulses sent to the brain.
All these pigments have one thing in common—lots of double bonds. For example, the pigment responsible for the red colour in tomatoes, lycopene, is a long-chain polyalkene.

lycopene, the red pigment in tomatoes, rose hips, and other berries

Lycopene contains only carbon and hydrogen; many pigments contain other elements. But
nearly all contain double bonds—and many of them. This chapter is about the properties,
including colour, of molecules that have several double bonds. These properties depend on
the way the double bonds join up, or conjugate, and the resulting delocalization of the electrons
within them.
In earlier chapters we talked about carbon skeletons made up of σ bonds. In this chapter we
shall see how, in some cases, we can also have a large π framework spread over many atoms
and how this dominates the chemistry of such compounds. We shall see how this π framework is responsible for the otherwise unexpected stability of certain cyclic polyunsaturated

compounds, including benzene, but also reactivity in others, such as butadiene. We shall also
see how this π framework gives rise to colour. To understand such molecules properly, we need
to start with the simplest of all unsaturated compounds, ethene.

on the left. The carbon atoms are roughly trigonal and the C�C bond distance is shorter than
that of a typical C–C single bond. The electronic structure of ethene, you will recall from
Chapter 4, can be considered in terms of two sp[2] hybridized C atoms with a σ bond between
them and four σ bonds linking them each to two H atoms. The π bond is formed by overlap of
a p orbital on each carbon atom.

_Ethene is chemically more interesting than ethane because of the π system. As you saw in_
Chapter 5, alkenes can be nucleophiles because the electrons in the π bond are available for
donation to an electrophile. But remember that when we combine two atomic orbitals we
get two molecular orbitals, from combining the p orbitals either in phase or out of phase.
The in-phase combination accounts for the bonding molecular orbital (π), whilst the
out-of-phase combination accounts for the antibonding molecular orbital (π*). The
shapes of the orbitals as they were introduced in Chapter 4 are shown below, but in this
chapter we will also represent them in the form shown in the brown boxes—as the constituent p orbitals.

###### Molecules with more than one C==C double bond

 Benzene has three strongly interacting double bonds

The rest of this chapter concerns molecules with more than one C=C
double bond and what happens to the π orbitals when they interact. To
start, we shall take a bit of a jump and look at the structure of benzene.
Benzene has been the subject of considerable controversy since its discovery in 1825. It was soon worked out that the formula was C6H6, but how
were these atoms arranged? Some strange structures were suggested until
Kekulé proposed the correct structure in 1865.
Shown below are the molecular orbitals for Kekulé’s structure. As in
simple alkenes, each of the carbon atoms is sp[2] hybridized, leaving the
remaining p orbital free.

Kekulé's structure for benzene


The σ framework of the benzene ring is like the framework of an alkene, and for simplicity
we have just represented the σ bonds as green lines. The diffi culty comes with the p orbitals—
which pairs do we combine to form the π bonds? There seem to be two possibilities.

With benzene itself, these two forms are identical but, if we had a 1,2- or a 1,3-disubstituted
benzene compound, these two forms would be different. A synthesis was designed for the two
compounds in the box on the right but it was found that both compounds were identical. This
posed a problem to Kekulé—his structure didn’t seem to work after all. His solution—which
we now know to be incorrect—was that benzene rapidly equilibrates, or ‘resonates’, between
the two forms to give an averaged structure in between the two.
The molecular orbital answer to this problem is that all six p orbitals can combine to form
(six) new molecular orbitals, and the electrons in these orbitals form a ring of electron density above and below the plane of the molecule. Benzene does not resonate between the two
Kekulé structures—the electrons are in molecular orbitals spread equally over all the carbon
atoms. However, the term ‘resonance’ is still sometimes used (but not in this book) to
describe the averaging effect of this mixing of molecular orbitals. We shall describe the π
electrons in benzene as delocalized, that is, no longer localized in specifi c double bonds
between two particular carbon atoms but spread out, or delocalized, over all six atoms in
the ring.


-----

the circle represents the
delocalized system


The alternative drawing on the left shows the π system as a ring and does not put in the
double bonds: you may feel that this is a more accurate representation, but it does present
a problem when it comes to writing mechanisms. As you saw in Chapter 5, the curly
arrows we use represent two electrons. The circle here represents six electrons, so in order
to write reasonable mechanisms we still need to draw benzene as though the double bonds
were localized. However, when you do so, you must keep in mind that the electrons are
delocalized, and it does not matter which of the two arrangements of double bonds you
draw.
If we want to represent delocalization using these ‘localized’ structures, we can do so using
curly arrows. Here, for example, are the two ‘localized’ structures corresponding to 2-bromocarboxylic acid. The double bonds are not localized, and the relationship between the two
structures can be represented with curly arrows which indicate how one set of bonds map
onto the other.

**Br** **Br**

**Br**


These curly arrows are similar to the ones we introduced in Chapter 5, but there is a crucial
difference: here, there is no reaction taking place. In a real reaction, electrons move. Here,
they do not: the only things that ‘move’ are the double bonds in the structures. The curly
arrows just show the link between alternative representations of exactly the same molecule.
You must not think of them as showing ‘movement round the ring’. To emphasize this difference we also use a different type of arrow connecting them—a delocalization arrow made up
of a single line with an arrow at each end. Delocalization arrows remind us that our simple
fi xed-bond structures do not tell the whole truth and that the real structure is a mixture of
both.
The fact that the π electrons are not localized in alternating double bonds but are spread out over
_the whole system in a ring is supported by theoretical calculations and confi rmed by experi-_
mental observations. Electron diffraction studies show benzene to be a regular planar hexagon with all the carbon–carbon bond lengths identical (139.5 pm). This bond length is in
between that of a carbon–carbon single bond (154.1 pm) and a full carbon–carbon double
bond (133.7 pm). A further strong piece of evidence for this ring of electrons is revealed by
proton NMR and discussed in Chapter 13.

###### How to describe delocalization?

What words should be used to describe delocalization is a vexed question. Terms such as resonance, mesomerism,
conjugation, and delocalization are only a few of the ones you will fi nd in books. You will already have noticed that we’re
avoiding resonance because it carries a suggestion that the structure is somehow oscillating between localized structures.
We shall use the words conjugation and delocalization: conjugation focuses on the way that double bonds link together
into a single π system, while delocalization focuses on the electrons themselves. Adjacent double bonds, as you will see,
are conjugated; the electrons in them are delocalized.


###### Multiple double bonds not in a ring

Are electrons still delocalized even when there is no ring? To consider this, we’ll look at hexatriene—three double bonds and six carbons, like benzene, but without the ring. There are two
isomers of hexatriene, with different chemical and physical properties, because the central
double bond can adopt a cis or a trans geometry. The structures of both cis- and trans-hexatriene have been determined by electron diffraction and two important features emerge:

 - Both structures are essentially planar.

 - Unlike benzene, the double and single bonds have different lengths, but the central
double bond in each case is slightly longer than the end double bonds and the single
bonds are slightly shorter than a ‘standard’ single bond.

Here’s the most stable structure of trans-hexatriene, with benzene shown for comparison.



- The terminal double bonds
can’t have two forms because
they have only one substituent.

both single bonds are 146 pm

The reason for the deviation of the bond lengths from typical values and the preference for
planar structures is again due to the molecular orbitals which arise from the combination of
the six p orbitals. Just as in benzene, these orbitals can combine to give one molecular orbital
stretching over the whole molecule. The p orbitals can overlap and combine only if the molecule is planar.

If the molecule is twisted about one of the single bonds, then some overlap is lost, making
it harder to twist about the single bonds in this structure than in a simple alkene. Other planar arrangements are stable, however, and trans-hexatriene can adopt any of the planar conformations shown in the margin.

###### Conjugation

In benzene and hexatriene every carbon atom is sp[2] hybridized with one p orbital available to
overlap with its neighbours. The uninterrupted chain of p orbitals is a consequence of having
alternate double and single bonds. When two double bonds are separated by just one single
bond, the two double bonds are said to be conjugated. Conjugated double bonds have different
properties from isolated double bonds, both physically (they are often longer, as you have just
seen) and chemically (see Chapters 22).
You have already met several conjugated systems: lycopene at the start of this chapter and
β-carotene in Chapter 3, for example. Each of the 11 double bonds in β-carotene is separated


###### Conjugation

In the dictionary ‘conjugated’ is
defi ned, among other ways, as
‘joined together, especially in
pairs’ and ‘acting or operating
as if joined’. This does indeed fi t
very well with the behaviour of
such conjugated double bonds,
since the properties of a
conjugated system are different
from those of the component
parts.

from its neighbour by only one single bond. We again have a long chain in which all the p
orbitals can overlap to form molecular orbitals.

β-carotene—all eleven double bonds are conjugated

It is not necessary to have two C=O double bonds in order to have a conjugated system—the
C=C and C=O double bonds of propenal (acrolein) are also conjugated. What is important is
that the double bonds are separated by one and only one single bond. Here’s a counter-example:
arachidonic acid is one of the fabled ‘polyunsaturated’ fatty acids. None of the four double
bonds in this structure are conjugated since in between any two double bonds there is an sp[3]
carbon. This means that there is no p orbital available to overlap with the ones from the double bonds. The saturated carbon atoms ‘insulate’ the double bonds from each other and prevent conjugation.

these four double bonds are not conjugated—
they are all separated by two single bonds

**O**

**OH**

these tetrahedral (sp[3]) carbon atoms prevent
overlap of the p orbitals in the double bonds

If an atom has two double bonds directly attached to it, that is, there are no single bonds
separating them, again no conjugation is possible. The simplest compound with such an
arrangement is allene. The arrangement of the p orbitals in allene means that no delocalization is possible because the two π bonds are perpendicular to each other.

###### The conjugation of two π bonds

To understand the effects of conjugation on molecules, we need now to look at their molecular
orbitals. We’ll concentrated only on the electrons in π orbitals—you can take it that all the C–C
and C–H σ bonds are essentially the same as those of all the other molecules you met in
Chapter 4. We’ll start with the simplest compound that can have two conjugated π bonds:
butadiene. As you would expect, butadiene prefers to be planar to maximize overlap between
its p orbitals. But exactly how does that overlap happen, and how does it give rise to bonding?

###### The molecular orbitals of butadiene

Butadiene has two π bonds, each made up of two p orbitals: a total of four atomic
orbitals. We’d therefore expect four molecular orbitals, housing four electrons. Just like


-----

hexatriene above, these orbitals extend over the whole molecule, but we can easily work
out what these molecular orbitals look like simply by taking the orbitals of two alkenes
and interacting them side by side. We have two π orbitals and two π* orbitals, and we can
interact them in phase or out of phase. Here are the fi rst two, made by interacting the two
π orbitals:

We can represent all four molecular orbitals like this, stacked up in order of their energy in
a molecular orbital energy level diagram. With four orbitals, we can’t just use ‘*’ to represent
antibonding orbitals, so conventionally they are numbered ψ1–ψ4 (ψ is the Greek letter psi).

It’s worth noticing a couple of other things about the way we have represented these four
molecular orbitals before we move on. Firstly, the number of nodes (changes in phase as you
move from one orbital to the next) increases from zero in ψ1 to three in ψ4. Secondly, notice that
the p orbitals making up the π system are not all shown as the same size—their coeffi cients vary
according to the orbital they are in. This is a mathematical consequence of the way the orbitals
sum together, and you need not be concerned with the details, just the general principle that ψ1
and ψ4 have the largest coeffi cients in the middle; ψ2 and ψ3 the largest coeffi cients at the ends.
Now for the electrons: each orbital holds two electrons, so the four electrons in the π system
go into orbitals ψ1 and ψ2.


The term ‘coeffi cient’ describes
the contribution of an individual
atomic orbital to a molecular
orbital. It is represented by the
size of the lobes on each atom.

A closer look at these fi lled orbitals shows that in ψ1, the lowest energy bonding orbital,
the electrons are spread out over all four carbon atoms (above and below the plane) in one
continuous orbital. There is bonding between all four C atoms—three net bonding interactions. ψ2 has bonding interactions between carbon atoms 1 and 2, and also between 3 and
4 but an antibonding interaction between carbons 2 and 3—in other words, 2 – 1 = 1 net
bonding interaction. For the unoccupied orbitals there is a net –1 antibonding interaction
in ψ3 and a net –3 antibonding interaction in ψ4.
Overall, in both the occupied π orbitals there are electrons between carbons 1 and 2 and
between 3 and 4, but the antibonding interaction between carbons 2 and 3 in ψ2 partially
cancels out the bonding interaction in ψ1. Only ‘partially’, because the coeffi cients of the
antibonding pair of orbitals in ψ2 are smaller than the coeffi cients of the bonding pair in ψ1.
This explains why all the bonds in butadiene are not the same, and also why the middle
bond is like a single bond but with a little bit of double-bond character. Its double-bond
character extends to its preference for planarity, the fact that it takes more energy to rotate
about this bond than about a typical single bond, and the fact that it is slightly shorter (1.45
Å) than a typical C–C single bond (around 1.54 Å).



- In our glimpse of hexatriene
earlier in this chapter we saw
similar effects: a tendency to be
planar and restriction to rotation
about the slightly shortened
single bonds.

well you will need to remember
the formulae linking energy and

and frequency, E = hc/λ. See
p. 53 for more on these.


butadiene

ψ4


The molecular orbital diagram also helps us explain some aspects of the reactivity of butadiene. Notice that we have marked on for you the HOMO (ψ2) and the LUMO (ψ3). On either
side you can see the equivalent HOMO (π orbital) and LUMO (π* orbital) for the isolated alkene (i.e. ethene). Some relevant features to note:

 - The overall energy of the two bonding butadiene molecular orbitals is lower than that
of the two molecular orbitals for ethene. This means that conjugated butadiene is
more thermodynamically stable than just two isolated double bonds.

 - The HOMO of butadiene is higher in energy than the HOMO for ethene. This is
consistent with the fact that butadiene is more reactive than ethene towards
electrophiles.

 - The LUMO for butadiene is lower in energy than the LUMO for ethene. This is consistent
with the fact that butadiene is more reactive than ethene towards nucleophiles.

So conjugation makes butadiene more stable, but it also makes it more reactive to both
nucleophiles and electrophiles! This superfi cially surprising result is revisited in detail in
Chapter 19.

###### UV and visible spectra

In Chapter 2 you saw how, if given the right amount of energy, electrons can be promoted
from a low-energy atomic orbital to a higher energy one and how this gives rise to an atomic
absorption spectrum. Exactly the same process can occur with molecular orbitals: energy of
the right wavelength can promote an electron from a fi lled orbital (for example the HOMO)
to an unfi lled one (for example the LUMO), and plotting the absorption of energy against
wavelength gives rise to a new type of spectrum called, for obvious reasons which you will see
in a moment, a UV–visible spectrum.
You have just seen that the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO for butadiene
is less than that for ethene. We would therefore expect butadiene to absorb light of longer

wavelength than ethene (the longer the wavelength the lower the energy). This is indeed the
case: butadiene absorbs at 215 nm compared to 185 nm for ethene. The conjugation in butadiene means it absorbs light of a longer wavelength than ethene. One of the consequences of
conjugation is to lessen the gaps between fi lled and empty orbitals, and so allow absorption
of light of a longer wavelength.



- **The more conjugated a compound is, the smaller the energy transition between its HOMO and**
**LUMO, and hence the longer the wavelength of light it can absorb. UV–visible spectroscopy can**
**tell us about the conjugation present in a molecule.**


Both ethene and butadiene absorb in the UV region of the electromagnetic
spectrum. If we extend the conjugation further, the gap between HOMO and LUMO
will eventually be small enough to allow the compound to absorb visible light and
hence have a colour. Lycopene, the pigment in tomatoes, which we introduced at the
start of the chapter, has 11 conjugated double bonds (plus two unconjugated
ones). It absorbs blue–green light at about 470 nm: consequently tomatoes are red.
Chlorophyll, in the margin, has a cyclic conjugated system: it absorbs at long wavelengths and is green.

It is no coincidence that these and many other highly conjugated compounds are coloured.
All dyes and pigments based on organic compounds are highly conjugated.
The table below shows the approximate wavelengths of light absorbed by a polyene conjugated system containing various numbers n of double bonds. Note that the colour absorbed is
complementary to the colour transmitted—a red compound must absorb blue and green light
to appear red.

Fewer than about eight conjugated double bonds, and the compound absorbs only in the
UV. With more than eight conjugated double bonds, the absorption creeps into the visible
and, by the time it reaches 11, the compound is red. Blue or green polyenes are rare, and dyes
of these colours rely on more elaborate conjugated systems.


In colour chemistry, dye is a
soluble colorant while a pigment
is made of insoluble coloured
particles. In biology the word
pigment is used for any coloured
compound. Dyeing pigments are
often inorganic compounds,
which are coloured for reasons
other than conjugation, but
nonetheless to do with the gaps
between orbitals.

###### The allyl system

 The allyl anion

In butadiene, four atomic p orbitals interact to make four molecular orbitals; in hexatriene
(and you will soon see benzene too) six atomic orbitals interact to make six molecular orbitals.
We are now going to consider some common conjugated systems made up of three interacting
p orbitals. We’ll start with the structure we get from treating propene with a very strong base—
one strong enough to remove one of the protons from its methyl group. H[+] is removed, so the
product must have a negative charge, which formally resides on the carbon of what was the
methyl group. That carbon atom started off sp[3] hybridized (i.e. tetrahedral: it had four substituents), but after it has been deprotonated it must become trigonal (sp[2]), with only three substituents plus a p orbital to house the negative charge.



- Of course the anion doesn’t
really exist ‘free’ like this; it will
most likely have a metal cation
to which it is coordinated in
some way. The arguments we
are going to apply about its
structure are still valid whether
or not there is a metal
associated with it.


We could work out the orbitals of the allyl anion by combining this p orbital with a readymade π bond, but instead this time we will start with the three separate p atomic orbitals and
combine them to get three molecular orbitals. At fi rst we are not concerned about where the
electrons are—we are just building up the molecular orbitals.
The lowest energy orbital (ψ1) will have them all combining in phase. This is a bonding
orbital since all the interactions are bonding. The next orbital (ψ2) requires one node, and the
only way to include a node and maintain the symmetry of the system is to put the node
through the central atom. This means that when this orbital is occupied there will be no electron density on this central atom. Since there are no interactions between adjacent atomic
orbitals (either bonding or antibonding), this is a non-bonding orbital. The fi nal molecular

We can summarize all this information in a molecular orbital energy level diagram, and at
the same time put the electrons into the orbitals. We need four electrons—two from the alkene π bond and two more for the anion (these were the two in the C–H bond, and they are still
there because only a proton, H[+], was removed). The four electrons go into the lowest two orbitals, ψ1 and ψ2, leaving ψ3 vacant. Notice too that the energy of two of the electrons is lower
than it would have been if they had remained in unconjugated p orbitals: conjugation lowers
the energy of fi lled orbitals and makes compounds more stable.

are much higher in energy than
the π antibonding molecular

Where is the electron density in the allyl anion π system? We have two fi lled π molecular
orbitals and the electron density comes from a sum of both orbitals. This means there is
electron density on all three carbon atoms. However, the coeffi cients of the end carbons
are of a signifi cant size in both orbitals, but in ψ2 the middle carbon has no electron density
at all—it lies on a node. So overall, even though the negative charge is spread over the
whole molecule, the end carbons carry more of the electron density than the middle one.
We can represent this in two ways—the fi rst structure below emphasizes the delocalization
of the charge over the whole molecule, but fails to get across the important point that the
negative charge resides principally at the ends. Curly arrows do this much better: we can
use them to show that the negative charge is not localized, but principally divided between
the two end carbons.



- A reminder: this is not an
equilibrium—the arrows do not
represent the movement of
charge. The two structures are
alternative, imperfect
representations of an ‘averaged’
structure, and they are linked by
a double-headed delocalization
arrow.

The problem with these structures carrying curly arrows is that they seem to imply that
the negative charge (and the double bond for that matter) is jumping from one end of the
molecule to the other. This, as we have seen, is just not so. Another and perhaps better picture uses dotted lines and partial charges. But the structure with the dotted bonds, as with
the representation of benzene with a circle in the middle, is no good for writing mechanisms. Each of the representations has its strong and weak points: we shall use each as the
occasion demands.

###### Using NMR to study delocalization

Delocalization of the allyl anion, and the localization of the negative charge mainly on the end carbons, is clear from
its [13]C NMR spectrum as well. In Chapter 3 we explained that [13]C NMR gives us a good measure of the amount of
electron density around a C atom—the extent to which it is deshielded and therefore exposed to the applied magnetic
fi eld. If you need reminding about the terminology, theory, and practice of NMR, turn back now to Chapter 3,
pp. 52–63.
It is possible to record a [13]C NMR spectrum of an allyl anion with a lithium counterion. The spectrum shows only two
signals: the middle carbon at 147 ppm and the two end carbons both at 51 ppm. This confi rms two things: (i) both end
carbons are the same and the structure is delocalized, and (ii) most of the negative charge is on the end carbons—they
are more shielded (have a smaller chemical shift) as a result of the greater electron density. In fact, the central carbon’s
shift of 147 ppm is not far from that of a normal double-bond carbon (compare the signals in propene). The end carbons’
shift is in between that of a double bond and a saturated carbon directly bonded to a metal (e.g. methyllithium, whose
negative chemical shift results from the highly polarized Li–C bond).

What if, instead of taking just a proton, we had also taken away two electrons from propene?
In reality we can get such a structure quite straightforwardly from allyl bromide (prop-2-enyl
bromide or 1-bromoprop-2-ene). Carbon 1 in this compound has four atoms attached to it (a
carbon, two hydrogens, and a bromine atom) so it is tetrahedral (or sp[3] hybridized).
Bromine is more electronegative than carbon and so the C–Br bond is polarized towards the
bromine. It is quite easy to break this bond completely, with the bromine keeping both electrons from the C–Br bond to become bromide ion, Br [−], leaving behind an allyl cation. The
positively charged carbon now has only three substituents so it becomes trigonal (sp[2] hybridized). It must therefore have a vacant p orbital.

Like the allyl anion, the orbitals in the allyl cation are a combination of three atomic p orbitals, one from each carbon. So we can use the same molecular orbital energy level diagram as
we did for the anion, simply by adjusting the number of electrons we put into the orbitals.
This time, there are only two electrons, from the alkene, as those which were in the C–Br
bond have left with anionic bromide.

The two electrons in the fi lled orbital are in a lower energy orbital than they would have
been if they had stayed in an unconjugated p orbital: as with the anion, conjugation leads to
_stabilization._
The two electrons are spread over three carbon atoms. Overall, the allyl cation has a positive
charge. But where is the positive charge concentrated? What we need to do is look to see where
there is a defi cit of charge. The only orbital with any electrons in it is the bonding molecular
orbital ψ1. From the relative sizes of the coeffi cients on each atom we can see that the middle
carbon has more electron density on it than the end ones, so the end carbons must be more
positive than the middle one.
We expect both end carbons to be identical, and [13]C NMR tells us that this is so (see below).
Again we need a way of showing this delocalization, either on a single structure or as a pair of
localized structures linked by a delocalization arrow.

equivalence of the bonds and
delocalization of charge


curly arrows show the positive charge is
shared over both the end atoms


Notice how we draw the curly arrows here: we want to show the positive charge ‘moving’,
and it is tempting to draw a curly arrow starting from the positive charge. But curly arrows
must always start on something representing a pair of electrons. So we must move the positive
charge as a consequence of the movement of the electrons in the double bond: as we pull
them away from one end, they leave behind a positive charge.

###### Delocalization over three atoms is a common structural feature

 The carboxylate anion

You may already be familiar with one anion very much like the allyl anion—the carboxylate ion, which forms when a carboxylic acid reacts with a base. In this structure we again
have a negatively charged atom separated from a double bond by a single bond adjacent to
a single bond: it’s analogous to an allyl anion with oxygen atoms replacing two of the
carbon atoms.

X-ray crystallography shows both carbon–oxygen bond lengths in this anion to be the
same (136 pm), in between that of a normal carbon–oxygen double bond (123 pm) and
single bond (143 pm). The negative charge is spread out equally over the two oxygen atoms,
and we can represent this in two ways—as before, the one on the left shows the equivalence
of the two C–O bonds, but you would use the one on the right for writing mechanisms. The
delocalization arrow tells us that both localized forms contribute to the real structure.

###### The nitro group


the electrons are delocalized over the π
system


The nitro group consists of a nitrogen bonded to two oxygen atoms and a carbon (for example
an alkyl group). There are two ways of representing the structure: one using formal charges, the
other (which we suggest you avoid) using a dative bond. Notice in each case that one oxygen is
depicted as being doubly bonded, the other singly bonded. Drawing both oxygen atoms doubly bonded is incorrect—nitrogen cannot participate in fi ve bonds: this would require ten bonding
electrons around the N atom, and there are not enough s and p orbitals to put them in.


**O**


**O**


We call structures such as a
nitro and a carboxylate group
isoelectronic: the atoms may be
different but the number of and
arrangement of the bonding
electrons are the same.


The problem even with the ‘correct’ structure on the left is that the equivalence of the two
N–O bonds is not made clear. The nitro group has exactly the same number of electrons as a
carboxylate anion (although it’s neutral of course because nitrogen already has one more
electron than carbon) and the delocalized structure can be shown with curly arrows in the
same way.
We have not shown molecular orbital energy level diagrams for the carboxylate and nitro
groups, since they are similar to that of the allyl anion. Only the absolute energies of the
molecular orbitals are different since different elements with different electronegativities are
involved in each case.

delocalization in the
amide group


-----

Nylon is a synthetic polyamide, and shares with many proteins the property of durability. The
structure of this deceptively simple functional group has an unexpected feature which is
responsible for much of the stability it confers.
The allyl anion, carboxylate, and nitro groups have four electrons in a π system spread out
over three atoms. The nitrogen in the amide group also has a pair of electrons that can conjugate with the π bond of the carbonyl group. For effective overlap with the π bond, this lone
pair of electrons must be in a p orbital. This in turn means that the nitrogen must be sp[2]
hybridized.

**O**



- Contrast this with the lone
pair of a typical amine, which
lies in an sp[3] orbital (see
p. 103): an amine N is
pyramidal (sp[3]) while an amide
N is trigonal planar (sp[2]).

nitrogen is trigonal (sp[2]) with

In the carboxylate ion, a negative charge is shared (equally) between two oxygen atoms. In
an amide there is no charge as such—the lone pair on nitrogen is shared between the nitrogen
and the oxygen. The delocalization can be shown as usual by using curly arrows, as shown in
the margin.
This representation suffers from the usual problems. Curly arrows usually show electron
movement, but here they do not: they simply show how to get from one of the alternative
representations to the other. The molecular orbital picture of the amide tells us that the electrons are unevenly distributed over the three atoms in the π system with a greater electron
density on the oxygen: you can see this in the delocalized structure on the right, which has a
full negative charge on O and a positive charge on N. (We also indicated this in the diagram
of the lowest energy π orbital above, which has a greatest coeffi cient, and therefore greatest
electron density, on O.) Another aspect of the structure of the amide group that this pair of
structures indicates correctly is that there is partial double bond character between the C
atom and the N atom. We will come back to this shortly.
The real structure of the amide group lies in between the two extreme structures linked by
the delocalization arrow: a better representation might be the structure on the right. The
charges in brackets indicate substantial, although not complete, charges, maybe about a half
plus or minus charge. However, we cannot draw mechanisms using this structure.
We can summarize several points about the structure of the amide group, and we will then
return to each in a little more detail

 - The amide group is planar—this includes the fi rst carbon atoms of the R groups
attached to the carbonyl group and to the nitrogen atom.

 - The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen is delocalized into the carbonyl group.

 - The C–N bond is strengthened by this interaction—it takes on partial double bond
character. This also means that we no longer have free rotation about the C–N bond,
which we would expect if it were only a single bond.

 - The oxygen is more electron-rich than the nitrogen. Hence we might expect the
oxygen rather than the nitrogen to be the site of electrophilic attack.

 - The amide group as a whole is made more stable as a result of the delocalization.

How do we know the amide group is planar? X-ray crystal structures are the simplest answer.
Other techniques such as electron diffraction also show that simple (non-crystalline) amides
have planar structures. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) is an example.
The N–CO bond length in DMF (135 pm) is closer to that of a standard C–N double bond
(127 pm) than to that of a single bond (149 pm). This partial double bond character, which the
delocalized structures led us to expect, is responsible for restricted rotation about this C–N
bond. We must supply 88 kJ mol[−][1] if we want to rotate the C–N bond in DMF (remember a
single bond only takes about 3 kJ mol[−][1], while a full C–C double bond takes about 260 kJ
mol[−][1]). The amount of energy available at room temperature is only enough to allow this bond

to rotate slowly, and the result is quite clear in the [13]C NMR spectrum of DMF. There are three
carbon atoms altogether and three signals appear—the two methyl groups on the nitrogen are

signals, since the two methyl groups would become identical.

###### Amides in proteins

Proteins are composed of many amino acids joined together with amide bonds. The amino group of one can combine

The peptide unit so formed is a planar, rigid structure because of restricted rotation about the C–N bond. This rigidity
confers organizational stability on protein structures.

###### Conjugation and reactivity: looking forward to Chapter 10

Just as delocalization stabilizes the allyl cation and anion (at least some of the electrons in
conjugated systems end up in lower energy orbitals than they would have done without conjugation) so too is the amide group stabilized by the conjugation of the nitrogen’s lone pair
with the carbonyl group. This makes an amide C=O one of the least reactive carbonyl groups
(we shall discuss this in Chapter 10). Furthermore, the nitrogen atom of an amide group is very
different from that of a typical amine. Most amines are easily protonated. However, since the
lone pair on the amide’s nitrogen is conjugated into the π system, it is less available for protonation or, indeed, reaction with any electrophile. As a result, when an amide is protonated (and
it is not protonated easily, as you will see in the next chapter) it is protonated on oxygen rather
than nitrogen. The consequences of conjugation for reactivity extend far and wide, and will be
a running theme through many chapters in this book.

###### Aromaticity

It’s now time to go back to the structure of benzene. Benzene is unusually stable for an alkene
and is not normally described as an alkene at all. For example, whereas normal alkenes (whether
conjugated or not) readily react with bromine to give dibromoalkane addition products, benzene reacts with bromine only with diffi culty—it needs a catalyst (iron will do) and then the
product is a monosubstituted benzene and not an addition compound.

Bromine reacts with benzene in a substitution reaction (a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom), keeping the benzene structure intact. This ability to retain its conjugated structure
through all sorts of chemical reactions is one of the important differences between benzene
and other alkenes.

###### What makes benzene special?

You might assume benzene’s special feature is its ring structure. To see whether this is the
case, we’ll look at another cyclic polyene, cyclooctatetraene, with four double bonds in a ring.
Given what we have explained about the way that π systems gain stability by allowing overlap
between their p orbitals, you may be surprised to fi nd that cyclooctatetraene, unlike benzene,
is not planar. There is no conjugation between any of the double bonds—there are indeed
alternate double and single bonds in the structure, but conjugation is possible only if the
p orbitals of the double bonds can overlap and here they do not. The fact that there is no conjugation is shown by the alternating C–C bond lengths in cyclooctatetraene—146.2 and
133.4 pm—which are typical for single and double C–C bonds. If possible, make a model of
cyclooctatetraene for yourself—you will fi nd the compound naturally adopts the shape on
the right below. This shape is often called a ‘tub’.

Chemically, cyclooctatetraene behaves like an alkene, not like benzene. With bromine,
for example, it forms an addition product and not a substitution product. So benzene is
not special just because it is cyclic—cyclooctatetraene is cyclic too but does not behave
like benzene.

###### Heats of hydrogenation of benzene and cyclooctatetraene

C=C double bonds can be reduced using hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst (usually nickel or

More on this in Chapter 23.

palladium) to produce fully saturated alkanes. This process is called hydrogenation and it is
exothermic (that is, energy is released) since a thermodynamically more stable product, an
alkane, is produced.
When _cis-cyclooctene is hydrogenated to cyclooctane, 96 kJ mol[−][1] of energy is released._
Cyclooctatetraene releases 410 kJ mol[−][1] on hydrogenation. This value is approximately four
times one double bond’s worth, as we might expect. However, whereas the heat of hydrogena- H2

tion for cyclohexene is 120 kJ mol[−][1], on hydrogenating benzene only 208 kJ mol[−][1] is given out,
which is much less than the 360 kJ mol[−][1] that we would have predicted by multiplying the
fi gure for cyclohexene by 3. Benzene has something to make it stable which cycloctatetraene
does not have.

###### Varying the number of electrons

The mystery deepens when we look at what happens when we treat cyclooctatetraene with
powerful oxidizing or reducing agents. If 1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclooctatetraene is treated at
low temperature (–78 °C) with SbF5/SO2ClF (strongly oxidizing conditions) a dication is
formed. This cation, unlike the neutral compound, is planar and all the C–C bond lengths are
the same.

This dication still has the same
number of atoms as the neutral
species, only fewer electrons.
The electrons have come from
the π system, which is now two
electrons short. We could draw
a structure showing two localized positive charges, but the
charge is in fact spread over the
whole ring.


neutral compound is tub-shaped dication is planar

It is also possible to add electrons to cyclooctatetraene by treating it with alkali metals and
a dianion results. X-ray structures reveal this dianion to be planar, again with all C–C bond
lengths the same (140.7 pm). The difference between the anion and cation of cyclooctatetraene on the one hand and cyclooctatetraene on the other is the number of electrons in the
π system. Neutral, non-planar, cyclooctatetraene has eight π electrons, the planar dication has
six π electrons (as does benzene), and the planar anion has ten.
Can you see a pattern forming? The important point is not the number of conjugated atoms
but the number of electrons in the π system.



- **When they have four or eight π electrons, both six- and eight-membered rings adopt non-**
**planar structures; when they have six or ten π electrons, a planar structure is preferred.**


If you made a model of cyclooctatetraene, you might have tried to force it to be fl at. If you
managed this you probably found that it didn’t stay like this for long and that it popped back
into the tub shape. The strain in planar cyclooctatetraene can be overcome by the molecule


-----

adopting the tub conformation. The strain is due to the numbers of atoms and double bonds
in the ring—it has nothing to do with the number of electrons. The planar dication and dianion of cyclooctatetraene still have this strain. The fact that these ions do adopt planar structures must mean there is some other form of stabilization that outweighs the strain of being
planar. This extra stabilization is called aromaticity.

###### Benzene has six ππ molecular orbitals


The difference between the amount of energy we expect to get from benzene on hydrogenation (360 kJ mol[−][1]) and what is observed (208 kJ mol[−][1]) is about 150 kJ mol[−][1]. This represents a crude measure of just how extra stable benzene really is relative to what it would
be like with three localized double bonds. In order to understand the origin of this stabilization, we must look at the molecular orbitals. We can think of the π molecular orbitals of
benzene as resulting from the combination of the six p orbitals in a ring and, as with butadiene, each successively higher energy orbital contains one more node. This is what we get
for benzene:

all p orbitals out of phase: or


two ways of having
two nodal planes:

Interactive π-molecular orbitals
of benzene


The molecular orbital lowest in energy, ψ1, has no nodes, with all the orbitals combining
in phase. The next lowest molecular orbital will have one nodal plane, which can be
arranged in two ways depending on whether or not the nodal plane passes through a bond
or an atom. It turns out that these two different molecular orbitals both have exactly the
same energy, that is, they are degenerate, and we call them both ψ2. There are likewise two
ways of arranging two nodal planes and again there are two degenerate molecular orbitals
ψ3. The fi nal molecular orbital ψ4 will have three nodal planes, which must mean all the p
orbitals combining out of phase. Six electrons slot neatly into the three lowest energy
bonding orbitals.

###### The π molecular orbitals of other conjugated cyclic hydrocarbons


Notice that the layout of the energy levels in benzene is a regular hexagon with its apex pointing downwards. It turns out that the energy level diagram for the molecular orbitals resulting
from the combination of any regular cyclic arrangement of p orbitals can be deduced from the
appropriately sided polygon with an apex pointing downwards. The horizontal diameter (the
red line) represents the energy of a carbon p orbital and any energy levels on this line represent non-bonding molecular orbitals. All molecular orbitals with energies below this line are
bonding; all those above are antibonding.


-----

It’s worth noting a few points about these energy level diagrams:

- The method predicts the energy levels for the molecular orbitals of planar, cyclic
arrangements of identical atoms (usually all C) only.



- There is always one single molecular orbital lower in energy than all the others. This
is because there is always one molecular orbital where all the p orbitals combine in
phase.

- If there is an even number of atoms, there is also a single molecular orbital highest in
energy; otherwise there will be a pair of degenerate molecular orbitals highest in energy.



 - All the molecular orbitals come in degenerate pairs except the one lowest in energy
and (for even-numbered systems) the one highest in energy.

###### Molecular orbitals and aromaticity



- You can draw an analogy
here with the stability of ‘closed
shell’ electronic arrangements in
atoms.


Now we can begin to put all the pieces together and make sense of what we know so far. We’ll
compare the way that the electrons fi t into the energy level diagrams for benzene and planar
cyclooctatetraene. We are not concerned with the actual shapes of the molecular orbitals
involved, just their energies.
Benzene has six π electrons, which means that all its three bonding molecular orbitals are
fully occupied, giving what we can call a ‘closed shell’ structure. Cyclooctatetraene’s eight
electrons, on the other hand, do not fi t so neatly into its orbitals. Six of these fi ll up the bonding molecular orbitals but there are two electrons left. These must go into the degenerate pair
of non-bonding orbitals. Hund’s rule (Chapter 4) would suggest one in each. Planar cyclooctatetraene would not have the closed shell structure that benzene has—to get one it must either
lose or gain two electrons. This is exactly what we have already seen—both the dianion and
dication from cyclooctatetraene are planar, allowing delocalization all over the ring, whereas
neutral cyclooctatetraene avoids the unfavourable arrangement of electrons shown below by
adopting a tub shape with localized bonds.

###### Hückel’s rule tells us if compounds are aromatic

As we pointed out on the previous page, all the cyclic conjugated hydrocarbons have a single
lowest energy molecular orbital, and then a stack of degenerate pairs of orbitals of increasing
energy. Since the single low energy orbital holds two electrons, and then the successive degenerate pairs four each, a ‘closed shell’ arrangement in which all the orbitals below a certain level
are fi lled will always contain (4n + 2) electrons (where n is an integer—0, 1, 2, etc.—corresponding to the number of degenerate orbital pairs). This is the basis of Hückel’s rule.



- This is not a strict defi nition
of aromaticity: it is actually very
diffi cult to defi ne aromaticity
precisely, but all aromatic
systems obey Hückel’s (4n + 2)
rule.



- **Hückel’s rule**

**Planar, fully conjugated, monocyclic systems with (4n++** **2)** π **electrons have a closed shell of**
**electrons all in bonding orbitals and are exceptionally stable. Such systems are said to be**
**aromatic.**

**Analogous systems with 4n** π **electrons are described as anti-aromatic.**


The next (4n + 2) number after six is ten so we might expect this cyclic alkene, [10]annulene,
to be aromatic. But if a compound with fi ve cis double bonds were planar, each internal angle
would be 144°. Since a normal double bond has bond angles of 120°, this would be far from
ideal. This compound can be made but it does not adopt a planar conformation and therefore
is not aromatic even though it has ten π electrons.

double bonds: all bond
angles can be 120°


**Annulenes are compounds**

single bonds. The number in

aromatic because it is too

[18]-annulene


obeys the (4n + 2)
rule and is planar
and aromatic [20]-annulene


has 4n electrons: is not
planar and not aromatic


By contrast, [18]annulene, which is also a (4n + 2) π electron system (n = 4), does adopt a
planar conformation and is aromatic. The trans–trans–cis double bond arrangement allows all
bond angles to be 120˚. [20]Annulene presumably could become planar (it isn’t quite) but
since it is a 4n π electron system rather than a 4n + 2 system, it is not aromatic and the structure shows localized single and double bonds.
When the conjugated systems are not monocyclic, the situation becomes a little less
clear. Naphthalene, for example, has ten electrons but you can also think of it as two fused
benzene rings. From its chemistry, it is very clear that naphthalene has aromatic character
(it does substitution reactions) but is less aromatic than benzene itself. For example, naphthalene can easily be reduced to tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene), which still contains a benzene ring. Also, in contrast to benzene, all the bond lengths in naphthalene are
not the same. 1,6-Methano[10]annulene is rather like naphthalene but with the middle
bond replaced by a methylene bridging group. This compound is almost fl at and shows
aromatic character.

Hückel’s rule helps us predict and understand the aromatic stability of numerous other
systems. Cyclopentadiene, for example, has two conjugated double bonds but the conjugated system is not cyclic since there is an sp[3] carbon in the ring. However, this compound
is relatively easy to deprotonate to give a very stable anion in which all the bond lengths are
the same.

Each of the double bonds contributes two electrons and the negative charge (which must be

The energy level diagram shows that six π electrons completely fi ll the bonding molecular
orbitals, thereby giving a stable aromatic structure.

###### Heterocyclic aromatic compounds

So far all the aromatic compounds you have seen have been hydrocarbons. However, most
aromatic systems are heterocyclic—that is, they contain atoms other than just carbon and
hydrogen. (In fact the majority of all organic compounds are aromatic heterocycles!) A simple
example is pyridine, in which a nitrogen replaces one of the CH groups of benzene. The ring
still has three double bonds and thus six π electrons.
Consider the structure shown on the left, pyrrole. This is also aromatic but it’s not enough
just to use the electrons in the double bonds: in pyrrole the nitrogen’s lone pair contributes
to the six π electrons needed for the system to be aromatic. Aromatic chemistry makes several more appearances in this book: in Chapter 21 we shall look at the chemistry of benzene
and in Chapters 30 and 31 we shall discuss heterocyclic aromatic compounds in much more
detail.

###### Organic compounds are more soluble in water as ions


Most organic compounds are insoluble in water. But sometimes it’s necessary to make them
dissolve, perhaps by converting them to anions or cations. Water can solvate both cations and
anions, unlike some of the solvents you will meet later. A good way of dissolving an organic
acid is to put it in basic solution: the base deprotonates the acid to give an anion. A simple
example is aspirin: whilst the acid itself is not very soluble in water, the sodium salt is much
more soluble. The sodium salt forms with the weak base, sodium hydrogencarbonate.


Water is special for many reasons, and it falls into a class of
solvents we call polar protic solvents. We will discuss other solvents in this class, as well as
polar aprotic solvents (such as
acetone and DMF) and nonpolar solvents (such as toluene
and hexane) in Chapter 12.

The sodium or calcium salt of ‘normal’ aspirin is sold as ‘soluble aspirin’. But when the pH of
a solution of aspirin’s sodium salt is lowered, the amount of the ‘normal’ acidic form present
increases and the solubility decreases. In the acidic environment of the stomach (around pH 1–2),
soluble aspirin will be converted back to the normal acidic form and precipitate out of solution.

In the same way, organic bases such as amines can be dissolved by lowering the pH. Codeine
(7,8-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-6-ol) is a commonly used painkiller. Codeine itself is not very soluble in water but it does contain a basic nitrogen atom that
can be protonated to give a more soluble salt. It is usually encountered as a phosphate salt. The
structure is complex, but that doesn’t matter.

###### Charged compounds can be separated by acid–base extraction

Adjusting the pH of a solution often provides an easy way to separate compounds.
Separating a mixture of benzoic acid (PhCO2H) and toluene (PhMe) is easy: dissolve
the mixture in CH2Cl2, add aqueous NaOH, shake the mixture of solutions, and separate
the layers. The CH2Cl2 layer contains all the toluene. The aqueous layer contains the
sodium salt of benzoic acid. Addition of HCl to the aqueous layer precipitates the insoluble
benzoic acid.

A more realistic separation is given in a modern practical book after a Cannizzaro reaction.
You will meet this reaction in Chapters 26 and 39 but all you need to know now is that there
are two products, formed in roughly equal quantities. Separation of these from starting material and solvent, as well as from each other, makes this a useful reaction.

In the same way, any basic compounds dissolved in an organic layer can be extracted by
washing the layer with dilute aqueous acid and recovered by raising the pH, which will
precipitate out the less soluble neutral compound. A general way to make amines is by
‘reductive amination.’ Ignore the details of this reaction for now (we come back to them in
Chapter 11) but consider how the amine might be separated from starting material, byproducts, and solvent.

As the reaction mixture is weakly acidic, the amine will be protonated and will be soluble
in water. The starting material and intermediate (of which very little is present anyway) are
soluble in organic solvents. Extracting the aqueous layer and neutralizing with NaOH gives
the amine.
Whenever you do any extractions or washes in practical experiments, just stop and ask
yourself: ‘What is happening here? In which layer is my compound and why?’ You will then
be less likely to throw away the wrong layer (and your precious compound)!

###### Acids, bases, and pKa

If we are going to make use of the acid–base properties of compounds as we have just described,
we are going to need a way of measuring how acidic or how basic they are. Raising the pH leads
to deprotonation of aspirin and lowering the pH leads to protonation of codeine, but how far
do we have to raise or lower the pH to do this? The measure of acidity or basicity we need is
called pKa. The value of pKa tells us how acidic (or not) a given hydrogen atom in a compound
is. Knowing about pKa tells us, for example, that the amine product from the reaction just
above will be protonated at weakly acidic pH 5, or that only a weak base (sodium hydrogen
carbonate) is needed to deprotonate a carboxylic acid such as aspirin. It is also useful because
many reactions proceed through protonation or deprotonation of one of the reactants (you
met some examples in Chapter 6), and it is obviously useful to know what strength acid or
base is needed. It would be futile to use too weak a base to deprotonate a compound but,
equally, using a very strong base where a weak one would do risks the result of cracking open
a walnut with a sledge hammer.
The aim of this chapter is to help you to understand why a given compound has the pKa that
it does. Once you understand the trends involved, you should have a good feel for the pKa
values of commonly encountered compounds and also be able to predict roughly the values
for unfamiliar compounds.


###### Benzoic acid preserves soft drinks

Benzoic acid is used as a preservative in foods and soft drinks (E210). Like acetic acid, it is only the acid form that is
effective as a bactericide. Consequently, benzoic acid can be used as a preservative only in foodstuffs with a relatively
low pH, ideally less than its pKa of 4.2. This isn’t usually a problem: soft drinks, for example, typically have a pH of 2–3.
Benzoic acid is often added as the sodium salt (E211), perhaps because this can be added to the recipe as a concentrated
solution in water. At the low pH in the fi nal drink, most of the salt will be protonated to give benzoic acid proper, which
presumably remains in solution because it is so dilute.


###### Acidity

Let’s start with two simple, and probably familiar, defi nitions:



**•** **An acid is a species having a tendency to lose a proton.**

**•** **A base is a species having a tendency to accept a proton.**


-----

‘The proton is a unique chemical
species, being a bare nucleus. As
a consequence it has no
independent existence in the
condensed state and is
invariably found bound by a pair
of electrons to another atom.’
Ross Stewart, The Proton:
Applications to Organic
Chemistry, Academic Press,
Orlando, 1985, p. 1.


###### An isolated proton is extremely reactive—formation of H3O[+] in water

Gaseous HCl is not an acid at all—it shows no tendency to dissociate into H[+] and Cl[−] as the
H–Cl bond is strong. But hydrochloric acid—that is, a solution of HCl in water—is a strong
acid. The difference is that an isolated proton H[+] is too unstable to be encountered under
normal conditions, but in water the hydrogen of HCl is transferred to a water molecule and
not released as a free species.

The chloride anion is the same in both cases: the only difference is that a very unstable
naked proton would have to be the other product in the gas phase but a much more stable
H3O[+] cation would be formed in water. In fact it’s even better than that, as other molecules of
water cluster round (‘solvate’) the H3O[+] cation, stabilizing it with a network of hydrogen
bonds.
That is why HCl is an acid in water. But how strong an acid is it? This is where chloride plays
a role: hydrochloric acid is a strong acid because chloride ion is a stable anion. The sea is full
of it! Water is needed to reveal the acidic quality of HCl, and acidity is determined in water
as the standard solvent. If we measure acidity in water, what we are really measuring is how
much our acid transfers a proton to a water molecule.
HCl transfers its proton almost completely to water, and is a strong acid. But the transfer of
protons to water from carboxylic acids is only partial. That is why carboxylic acids are weak
acids. Unlike the reaction of HCl with water, the reaction below is an equilibrium.

###### The pH scale and pKa


**H**
**O**


carboxylic acid carboxylate anion


The amount of H3O[+] in any solution in water is described using the pH scale. pH is simply a
measure of the concentration of H3O[+] on a logarithmic scale, and it is characteristic of any
aqueous acid—it depends not only on what the acid is (hydrochloric, acetic, etc.) but also on
how concentrated the acid is.



- **pH is the negative logarithm of the H3O[+] concentration.**

**pH = –log[H3O[+]]**


You will already know that neutrality is pH 7 and that below pH 7 water is increasingly
acidic while above pH 7 it is increasingly basic. At higher pH, there is little H3O[+] in the solution and more hydroxide ion, but at lower pH there is more H3O[+] and little hydroxide.

- We will explain later why
this scale seems to stop at pH 0
and 14—in fact these numbers
are approximate, but easy to
remember.


The reason that higher pH means less H3O[+] is because the arbitrary defi nition of pH is the
_negative logarithm (to the base 10) of the H3O[+] concentration. To summarize in a diagram:_

-----

pH is used to measure the acidity of aqueous solutions, but what about the inherent tendency of an acidic compound to give up H[+] to water and form these acid solutions? A good way
of measuring this tendency is to fi nd the pH at which a solution contains exactly the same
amount of the protonated, acidic form and its deprotonated, basic form. This number, which
is characteristic of any acid, is known as the pKa. In the example just above, this would be the
pH where the amount of the carboxylic acid is matched by the amount of its carboxylate
salt—which happens to be at about pH 5: the pKa of acetic acid is 4.76.
We’ll come back to a more formal defi nition of pKa later, but fi rst we need to look more
closely at this pair of species—the protonated acid and its deprotonated, basic partner.

###### Every acid has a conjugate base

Looking back at the equilibrium set up when acetic acid dissolves in water, but drawing the
mechanism of the back reaction, we see acetate ion acting as a base and H3O[+] acting as an acid.
In all equilibria involving just proton transfer a species acting as a base on one side acts as an
acid on the other. We describe H3O[+] as the conjugate acid of water and water as the conjugate
_base of H3O[+]. In the same way, acetic acid is the conjugate acid of acetate ion and acetate ion_
is the conjugate base of acetic acid.

Water doesn’t have to be one of the participants—if we replace water in the reaction we have
been discussing with ammonia, we now have ammonia as the conjugate base of NH4+ (the ammonium cation) and the ammonium cation as the conjugate acid of ammonia. What is different is
the position of equilibrium: ammonia is more basic than water and now the equilibrium will be
well over to the right. As you will see, pKa will help us assess where equilibria like these lie.

The amino acids you met in Chapter 2 have carboxylic acid and amine functional groups

group to the NH2 group and form a zwitterion. This German term describes a double ion having positive and negative charges in the same molecule.

###### Water can behave as an acid or as a base

So far we have seen water acting as a (very weak) base to form H3O[+]. If we added a strong base,
such as sodium hydride, to water, the base would deprotonate the water to give hydroxide ion,


-----

HO[−], and here the water would be acting as an acid. It’s amusing to notice that hydrogen gas
is the conjugate acid of hydride ion, but more important to note that hydroxide ion is the
conjugate base of water.


**O**
**NaH** **Na  + H** **H**


**H** **H2  +   OH**



- Water is still safe to drink
because the concentrations of
hydronium and hydroxide ions
are very small (10[−7] mol dm[−3]
corresponds to about 2 parts
per billion). This very low
concentration means that there
are not enough free hydronium
or hydroxide ions in water to do
any harm when you drink it, but
neither are there enough to
provide acid or base catalysts for
reactions which need them.



- The fi gures 0 and 14 are
approximate—there is a simple
reason why this is so, which we
will explain shortly. But you see
now why we end the scale at
these points—below 0 and
above 14 there is little scope for
varying the concentration of
H3O[+].


Water is a weak acid and a weak base so we need a strong acid like HCl to give much H3O[+],
and a strong base, like hydride ion, to give much hydroxide ion.

###### The ionization of water

The concentration of H3O[+] ions in water is very low indeed at 10[−][7] mol dm[−][3]. Pure water at
25 °C therefore has a pH of 7.00. Hydronium ions in pure water can arise only from water
protonating (and deprotonating) itself. One molecule of water acts as a base, deprotonating
another that acts as an acid. For every H3O[+] ion formed, a hydroxide ion must also be formed,
so that in pure water at pH 7 the concentrations of H3O[+] and hydroxide ions must be equal:

[H3O[+]] = [HO[−]] = 10[−][7] mol dm[−][3].

**O**

**H2O** **H** **H** **H3O** **+   OH**

The product of these two concentrations is known as the ionization constant (or as the ionic
_product) of water, KW, with a value of 10[−][14] mol[2] dm[−][6] (at 25 °C). This is a constant in aqueous_
solutions, so if we know the hydronium ion concentration (which we can get by measuring
the pH), we also know the hydroxide concentration since the product of the two concentrations always equals 10[−][14].
So, roughly at what pH does water become mostly H3O[+] ions and at what pH mostly hydroxide ions? We can now add two additional pieces of information to the approximate chart we
gave you before. At pH 7, water is almost entirely H2O. At about pH 0, the concentrations of
water and H3O[+] ions are about the same and at about pH 14, the concentrations of hydroxide
ions and water are about the same.

**H3O** **H2O** **H2O** **H2O** **OH**


**at pH ~ 0** **pH** 0 7 14 **at pH ~ 14**

**[H2O] = [H3O[+]]** **[H2O] = [HO[–]]**

###### Acids as preservatives

Acetic acid is used as a preservative in many foods, for example pickles, mayonnaise, bread, and fi sh products, because
it prevents bacteria and fungi growing. However, its fungicidal nature is not due to any lowering of the pH of the foodstuff. In fact, it is the undissociated acid that acts as a bactericide and a fungicide in concentrations as low as 0.1–0.3%.
Besides, such a low concentration has little effect on the pH of the foodstuff anyway.
Although acetic acid can be added directly to a foodstuff (disguised as E260), it is more common to add vinegar, which
contains between 10 and 15% acetic acid. This makes the product more ‘natural’ since it avoids the nasty ‘E numbers’.
Actually, vinegar has also replaced other acids used as preservatives, such as propionic (propanoic) acid (E280) and its
salts (E281, E282, and E283).


###### The defi nition of pKa

When we introduced you to pKa on p. 167, we said it is the pH at which an acid and its conjugate base are present in equal concentrations. We can now be more precise about the defi nition


-----

of pKa. pKa is the log (to the base ten) of the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the
acid. For an acid HA this is:


**_Ka_**

**HA + H2O** **H3O  + A** **pKa = –log Ka** **_Ka =_**



**[H3O[+]] [A[–]]**

**[AH]**


The concentration of water is ignored in the defi nition because it is also constant (at 25 °C).
Because of the minus sign in the defi nition (it’s there too in the defi nition of pH) the lower
the pKa the larger the equilibrium constant and the stronger the acid. You may fi nd the way
we introduced pKa more helpful as a concept for visualizing pKa: any acid is half dissociated
in a solution whose pH matches the acid’s pKa. At a pH above the pKa the acid exists largely as
its conjugate base (A[−]) but at a pH below the pKa the acid largely exists as HA.
With pKa we can put fi gures to the relative strengths of hydrochloric and acetic acid we
introduced earlier. HCl is a much stronger acid than acetic acid: the pKa of HCl is around –7
compared to 4.76 for acetic acid. This tells us that in solution _Ka for hydrogen chloride is_
10[7] mol dm[−][3]. This is an enormous number: only one molecule in 10,000,000 is not dissociated, so it is essentially fully dissociated. But Ka for acetic acid is only 10[−][4.76] = 1.74 × 10[−][5] mol
dm[−][3] so it is hardly dissociated at all: only a few molecules in every million of acetic acid are
present as the acetate ion.


How concentrated is water? One
mole of pure water has a mass
of 18 g and occupies 18 cm[3].
So, in 1 dm[3], there are
1000/18 = 55.56 mol. Water is
a 55.56 mol dm[−3] solution of
water...in water.


**HCl + H2O** **H3O   + Cl**

**O**


**_Ka_** **= 10[7]**

**_Ka = 1.74 x 10[-5]_**


**H2O +** **HO** **H3O**


+
**O**


What about the pKa of water? You know the fi gures already: Ka for water is [H3O[+]] × [HO[−]]/

[H2O] = 10[−][14]/55.5. So pKa = – log[10[−][14]/55.5] = 15.7. Now you see why water isn’t really quite
half dissociated at pH 14—the concentration of water in the equation means that the two
ends of the scale on p. 168 are not at 0 and 14, but at –1.7 and 15.7.

###### A graphical description of the pKa of acids and bases

For both cases, adjusting the pH alters the proportions of the acid form and of the conjugate
base. The graph plots the concentration of the free acid AH (green curve) and the ionized
conjugate base A[−] (red curve) as percentages of the total concentration as the pH is varied. At
low pH the compound exists entirely as AH and at high pH entirely as A[−]. At the pKa the concentration of each species, AH and A[−], is the same. At pHs near the pKa the compound exists
as a mixture of the two forms.

Now we have established why you need to understand acids and bases, we must move on to
consider why some acids are stronger than other acids and some bases stronger than other
bases. To do this we must be able to estimate the pKa of common classes of organic compounds.


-----

You do not need to learn exact fi gures for pKa values, but you will certainly need to develop a
feel for approximate values—we will guide you towards which fi gures are worth learning and
which you can leave to be looked up when you need them.

###### An acid’s pKa depends on the stability of its conjugate base

The stronger the acid, the easier it is to ionize, which means that it must have a stable conjugate base. Conversely, a weak acid is reluctant to ionize because it has an unstable conjugate
base. The other side of this coin is that unstable anions A[−] make strong bases and their conjugate acids AH are weak acids.



- **Acid and conjugate base strength**

**The stronger the acid HA, the weaker its conjugate base A[−].**

**The stronger the base A[−], the weaker its conjugate acid AH.**


For example, hydrogen iodide has a very low pKa, about –10. This means that HI is a strong
enough acid to protonate almost anything. Its conjugate base, iodide ion, is therefore not basic at
all—it will not deprotonate anything. A very powerful base is methyllithium, MeLi. Although it
is actually a covalent compound, as we discuss in Chapter 9, for the purpose of the discussion here
you can think of MeLi as CH3−Li+. CH3− can accept a proton to become neutral methane, CH4.
Methane is therefore the conjugate acid. Clearly, methane isn’t at all acidic—its pKa is estimated to
be 48. The table below gives a few inorganic compounds and their approximate pKa values.

The approximate pKa values of some inorganic compounds

Acid pKa Conjugate base Acid pKa Conjugate base Acid pKa Conjugate base

H2SO4 –3 HSO4− H3O[+] –1.7 H2O NH4+ 9.2 NH3
HCl –7 Cl[−] H2O 15.7 HO[−] NH3 33 NH2−

HI –10 I[−] H2S 7.0 HS[−]

Notice that the lower down the periodic table we go, the stronger the acid. Notice also that
oxygen acids are stronger than nitrogen acids. We have also put down more exact pKa values
for water but you need remember only the approximate values of 0 and 14. Over the next few
pages we shall be considering the reasons for these differences in acid strength but we are fi rst
going to consider the simple consequences of mixing acids or bases of different strengths.
Notice the vast range covered by pKa values: from around –10 for HI to nearly 50 for methane.
This corresponds to a difference of 10[60] in the equilibrium constant.

###### The choice of solvent limits the pKa range we can use

In water, we can measure the pKa of an acid only if the acid does not completely protonate water
to give H3O[+] or completely deprotonate it to give HO[−]. We are restricted roughly to pH –1.7 to
15.7, beyond which water is more than 50% protonated or deprotonated. The strength of acids
or bases we can use in any solvent is limited by the acidity and basicity of the solvent itself.
Think of it this way: say you want to remove the proton from a compound with a high pKa, say
25–30. It would be impossible to do this in water since the strongest base we can use is hydroxide. If you add a base stronger than hydroxide, it won’t deprotonate your compound, it will just
deprotonate water and make hydroxide anyway. Likewise, acids stronger than H3O[+] can’t exist
in water: they just protonate water completely to make H3O[+]. If you do need a stronger base than
OH[−] (or a stronger acid than H3O[+], but this is rarer) you must use a different solvent.
Let’s take acetylene as an example. Acetylene (ethyne) has pKa 25. This is remarkably low
for a hydrocarbon (see below for why) but, even so, hydroxide (the strongest base we could
have in aqueous solution, pKa 15.7) would establish an equilibrium where only 1 in 10[9.3]
(10[15.7]/10[25]), or about 1 in 2 billion, ethyne molecules are deprotonated. We can’t use a
stronger base than hydroxide, since, no matter what strong base we dissolve in water,
we will only at best get hydroxide ions. So, in order to deprotonate ethyne to any appreciable extent, we must use a different solvent—one that does not have a pKa less than 25.


-----

Conditions often used to do this reaction are sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia.
Using the pKa values of NH3 (ca. 33) and ethyne (25) we would estimate an equilibrium
constant for this reaction of 10[8] (10[−][25]/10[−][33])—well over to the right. Amide ions can be used
to deprotonate alkynes.

Since we have an upper and a lower limit on the strength of an acid or base that we can use
in water, this poses a bit of a problem: how do we know that the pKa for HCl is more negative
than that of H2SO4 if both completely protonate water? How do we know that the pKa of methane is greater than that of ethyne since both the conjugate bases fully deprotonate water? The
answer is that we can’t simply measure the equilibrium for the reaction in water—we can do
this only for pKa values that fall between the pKa values of water itself. Outside this range, pKa
values are determined in other solvents and the results are extrapolated to give a value for
what the pKa in water might be.

###### Constructing a pKa scale

We now want to look at ways to rationalize, and estimate, the different pKa values for different
compounds—we wouldn’t want to have to memorize all the values. You will need to get a feel
for the pKa values of different compounds and if you know what factors affect them it will
make it much easier to predict an approximate pKa value, or at least understand why a given
compound has the pKa value that it does.

**AH (solvent)** **A[–] (solvent) + H[+] (solvent)**

A number of factors affect the strength of an acid AH. These include:

**1.** The intrinsic stability of the conjugate base, anion A[−]. Stability can arise by having the
negative charge on an electronegative atom or by spreading the charge over several
atoms (delocalization) groups. Either way, the more stable the conjugate base, the
stronger the acid HA.

**2.** Bond strength A–H. Clearly, the easier it is to break this bond, the stronger the acid.

**3.** The solvent. The better the solvent is at stabilizing the ions formed, the easier it is for
the reaction to occur.



- Because the pKa values for
very strong acids and bases are
so hard to determine, you will
fi nd that they often differ in
different texts—sometimes the
values are no better than good
guesses! However, while the
absolute values may differ, the
relative values (which is the
important thing because we
need only a rough guide) are
usually consistent.



- **Acid strength**

**The most important factor in the strength of an acid is the stability of the conjugate base—the**
**more stable the conjugate base, the stronger the acid.**

**An important factor in the stability of the conjugate base is which element the negative charge**
**is on—the more electronegative the element, the more stable the conjugate base.**


###### The negative charge on an electronegative element stabilizes the conjugate base

The pKa values for the ‘hydrides’ of the fi rst row elements CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF are about 48,
33, 16, and 3, respectively. This trend is due to the increasing electronegativities across the period:
F[−] is much more stable than CH3−, because fl uorine is much more electronegative than carbon.

###### Weak A–H bonds make stronger acids

However, on descending group VII (group 17), the pKa values for HF, HCl, HBr, and HI decrease:
3, –7, –9, and –10. Since the electronegativities decrease on descending the group we might
expect an increase in pKa. The decrease is due to the weakening bond strengths on descending
the group and to some extent the way in which the charge can be spread over the increasingly
large anions.

###### Delocalization of the negative charge stabilizes the conjugate base

The acids HClO, HClO2, HClO3, and HClO4 have pKa values 7.5, 2, –1, and about –10, respectively. In each case the acidic proton is on an oxygen attached to chlorine, that is, we are remov_ing a proton from the same environment in each case. Why then is perchloric acid, HClO4, some_
17 orders of magnitude stronger in acidity than hypochlorous acid, HClO? Once the proton is
removed, we end up with a negative charge on oxygen. For hypochlorous acid, this is localized on the one oxygen. With each successive oxygen, the charge can be more delocalized,
and this makes the anion more stable. For example, with perchloric acid, the negative charge
can be delocalized over all four oxygen atoms.

the negative charge on the perchlorate anion is delocalized over all four oxygens


That the charge is spread out over all the oxygen atoms equally is shown by electron diffraction studies: whereas
perchloric acid has two types of Cl–O bond, one 163.5 pm and the other three 140.8 pm long, in the perchlorate
anion all Cl–O bond lengths are the same, 144 pm, and all O–Cl–O bond angles are 109.5°. Just to remind you: these
delocalization arrows do not indicate that the charge is actually moving from atom to atom. We discussed this in
Chapter 7. These structures simply show that the charge is spread out in the molecular orbitals and mainly concentrated on the oxygen atoms.


Looking at some organic acids, we might expect alcohols to have a pKa not far from that of
water, and for ethanol that is correct (pKa 15.9). If we allow the charge in the conjugate base to
be delocalized over two oxygen atoms, as in acetate, acetic acid is indeed a much stronger acid
(pKa 4.8). The difference is huge: the conjugation makes acetic acid about 10[10] times stronger.

charge delocalized over three oxygens

Even delocalization into a hydrocarbon part of the molecule increases acid strength. In
phenol, PhOH, the OH group is directly attached to a benzene ring. On deprotonation, the
negative charge can again be delocalized, not onto other oxygen atoms but into the aromatic
ring itself. The effect of this is to stabilize the phenoxide anion relative to the conjugate base
of cyclohexanol, where no delocalization is possible, and this is refl ected in the pKa values of
the two compounds: 10 for phenol but 16 for cyclohexanol.

So now we can expand our chart of acid and base strengths to include the important
classes of alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids. They conveniently, and memorably, have
pKa values of about 0 for the protonation of alcohols, about 5 for the deprotonation of carboxylic acids, about 10 for the deprotonation of phenols, and about 15 for the deprotonation of alcohols. The equilibria above each pKa shows that at approximately that pH,
the two species each form 50% of the mixture. You can see that carboxylic acids are weak
acids, alkoxide ions (RO[−]) are strong bases, and that it will need a strong acid to protonate
an alcohol.

If we need to make the anion of a phenol, a base such as NaOH will be good enough, but if
we want to make an anion from an alcohol, we need a stronger base. Vogel (p. 986) suggests
potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is strong enough to make an ether from phenol. The base
strength of carbonate anion is about the same as that of phenoxide ion (PhO[−]) so the two will
be in equilibrium but enough phenoxide ion will be present for the reaction.



- It is worthwhile learning
these approximate values.

On the other hand, if we want to make the OH group into a good leaving group, we need
to protonate it and a very strong acid will be needed. Sulfuric acid is used to make ethers
from alcohols. Protonation of the OH groups leads to loss of water and formation of a cation.
This reacts with more alcohol to give the ether. There is another example of this reaction
in Chapter 5.



- As you will discover in
Chapters 10 and 15, a leaving
group is simply a functional
group that will leave the
molecule, taking with it the pair
of electrons that formed the
bond. Leaving groups may be
anions, such as bromide Br [−], or
protonated groups such as the
protonated alcohol in this
example, which leaves as water.

###### Nitrogen compounds as acids and bases

The most important organic nitrogen compounds are amines and amides. Amine nitrogens
can be joined to alkyl or aryl groups (in which case the amines are called anilines). They all
have lone pairs on nitrogen and may have hydrogen atoms on nitrogen too. As nitrogen is less
electronegative than oxygen, you should expect amines to be less acidic and more basic than
alcohols. And they are. The pKa values for the protonated amines are about 10 (this value is
about 0 for water and alcohol) and the pKa values for amines acting as acids are very high,
something like 35 (compared with about 15 for an alcohol). So ammonium salts are about
as acidic as phenols and amines will be protonated at pH 7 in water. This is why amino acids
(p. 167) exist as zwitterions in water.

Removing a proton from an amine is very diffi cult as the anion (unfortunately called an
‘amide’ anion) is very unstable and very basic. The only way to succeed is to use a very strong
base, usually an alkyllithium. The ‘anion’ then has a N–Li bond and is soluble in organic solvents. This example, known as LDA, is commonly used as a strong base in organic
chemistry.
The basicity of amines as neutral compounds is measured by the pKa of their conjugate
acids—so, for example, the pKa associated with the protonation of triethylamine, a commonly
used tertiary amine, is 11.0.

###### The ‘pKas’ of bases

Chemists often say things like ‘the pKa of triethylamine is about 10.’ (It’s actually 11.0 but 10
is a good number to remember for typical amines). This may surprise you as triethylamine
has no acidic hydrogens. What they mean is of course this: ‘the pKa of the conjugate acid of
triethylamine is about 10.’ Another way to put this is to write ‘the pKaH of triethylamine is
about 10.’ The subscript ‘aH’ refers to the conjugate acid.


the triethylammonium ion:
triethylamine's

triethylamine


It's OK to say ‘the pKa of triethylamine is about 10’
as long as you understand that what is really meant is
‘the pKa of the triethylammonium ion is about 10’,
which can also be expressed thus:
‘the pKaH of triethylamine is about 10’


**Et3NH[+]** **pKa = 11** **Et3N**

When a molecule is both acidic and basic, as for example aniline, it is important to work out
which pKa is meant as again chemists will loosely refer to ‘the pKa of aniline is 4.6’ when they
mean ‘the pKa of the conjugate acid of aniline is 4.6.’ Aniline is much less basic than ammonia
or triethylamine because the lone pair on nitrogen is conjugated into the ring and less available for protonation.

But for the same reason, aniline is also more acidic than ammonia (pKa 33) and has a genuine pKa in which one of the protons on nitrogen is lost. So we can say correctly that ‘the pKa
of aniline is about 28.’ Just be careful to check which pKa is meant in such compounds. The

The pKa associated for protonation of piperidine, a typical secondary amine, is about 13.
The equivalent pKa for protonation of pyridine—a compound with a similar heterocyclic
structure, but with its lone pair in an sp[2] rather than an sp[3] orbital, is only 5.5: pyridine is a
weaker base than piperidine (its conjugate acid is a stronger acid). Nitriles, whose lone pair is
sp hybridized, are not basic at all. Lone pairs with more p character (sp[3] orbitals are 3/4 p,
while sp orbitals are 1/2 p) are higher in energy—they spend more time further from the
nucleus—and are therefore more basic.
Amides are very different because of the delocalization of the lone pair into the carbonyl
group. This makes amides more acidic but less basic and protonation occurs on oxygen rather
than nitrogen. Amides have pKa values of around 15 when they act as acids, making them
some 10[10] times more acidic than amines. The pKa of protonated amides is around 0, making
them some 10[10] times weaker as bases.

If we replace the carbonyl oxygen atom in an amide by nitrogen we get an amidine.
Amidines are conjugated, like amides, but unlike amides they are _stronger bases than_
amines, by about 2–3 pKa units, because the two nitrogens work together to donate electron density onto each other. The bicyclic amidine DBU is often used as a strong organic
base (see Chapter 17).

###### Substituents affect the pKa

Substituents that are conjugated with the site of proton gain or loss, and even substituents
that are electronegative but not conjugating, can have signifi cant effects on pKa values. Phenol
has pKa 10 but phenols with anions stabilized by extra conjugation can have much lower pKas.


-----

One nitro group, as in p-nitrophenol, lowers the pKa to 7.14, nearly a thousand-fold increase
in acidity. This is because the negative charge on oxygen is delocalized into the very electronwithdrawing nitro group. By contrast 4-chlorophenol, with only inductive withdrawal in the
C–Cl bond, has pKa 9.38, hardly different from phenol itself.

Inductive effects of nearby electronegative atoms can also have marked effects on the pKa of
acids. Adding fl uorines to acetic acid reduces the pKa from about 5 by smallish steps.
Trifl uoroacetic acid (TFA) is a very strong acid indeed, and is commonly used as a convenient
strong acid in organic reactions. Inductive effects occur by polarization of σ bonds when the
atom at one end is more electronegative than at the other. Fluorine is much more electronegative than carbon (indeed, F is the most electronegative element of all) so each σ bond is very
polarized, making the carbon atom more electropositive and stabilizing the carboxylate anion.

think about the shapes of an s

charge has, the closer the
electron density is to the nucleus,
and the more stable it is.


Hydrocarbons are not acidic. We have already established that methane has a pKa of about 48
(p. 170 above)—it’s essentially impossible to deprotonate. Alkyllithiums are for this reason
among the strongest bases available. But some hydrocarbons can be deprotonated, the most
important example being alkynes—you saw on p. 171 that acetylene has a pKa of 25 and can
be deprotonated by NH2− (as well as other strong bases such as BuLi). The difference is one of
hybridization—an idea we introduced with the nitrogen bases above. Making the acetylide
anion, whose negative charge resides in an sp orbital, is much easier than making a methyl
anion, with a negative charge in an sp[3] orbital, because electrons in sp orbitals spend a lot of
their time closer to the nucleus than electrons in sp[3] orbitals.
C–H bonds can be even more acidic than those of acetylene if stabilization of the resulting
anion is possible by conjugation. Conjugation with a carbonyl group has a striking effect. One
carbonyl group brings the pKa down to 13.5 for acetaldehyde so that even hydroxide ion can
produce the anion. You will discover in Chapter 20 that we call this the ‘enolate anion’ and
that the charge is mostly on oxygen, although the anion can be drawn as a carbanion.

It is interesting to compare the strengths of the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen acids of similar
structure below. The ketone (acetone) is of course least acidic, the amide is more acidic, and the
carboxylic acid most acidic. The oxyanion conjugate bases are all delocalized but delocalization
onto a second very electronegative oxygen atom is much (~10 pH units) more effective than delocalization onto nitrogen, which is 4 pH units more effective than delocalization onto carbon.

Nevertheless, the effect of conjugation on the carbon acid compared with methane is enormous (~30 pH units) and brings proton removal from carbon within the range of accessible
bases
The nitro group is even more effective: nitromethane, with a pKa of 10, dissolves in aqueous NaOH. The proton is removed from carbon, but the negative charge in the conjugate
base is on oxygen. The big difference is that the nitrogen atom has a positive charge throughout. If the anion is protonated in water by some acid (HA) the ‘enol’ form of nitromethane is
the initial product and this slowly turns into nitromethane itself. Whereas proton transfers
between electronegative atoms (O, N, etc.) are fast, proton transfers to or from carbon can be
slow.

Carbon acids are very important in organic chemistry as they allow us to make carbon–
carbon bonds and you will meet many more of them in later chapters of this book.

###### Why do we need to compare acid strengths of O and N acids?

The rates of nucleophilic addition to carbonyl groups that you met in Chapter 6 depend on
the basicity of nucleophiles. As nitrogen bases are much stronger than oxygen bases (or, if you
prefer, ammonium ions are much weaker acids than H3O[+]), amines are also much better
nucleophiles than water or alcohols. This is dramatically illustrated in an amide synthesis
from aniline and acetic anhydride in aqueous solution.

Aniline is not very soluble in water but addition of HCl converts it into the soluble cation by
protonation at nitrogen. The solution is now warmed and equal amounts of acetic anhydride
and aqueous sodium acetate are added. The pKa of acetic acid is about 5, as is the pKa of
PhNH3+, so an equilibrium is set up and the solution now contains these species:

The only electrophile is acetic anhydride, with its two electrophilic carbonyl groups. The
nucleophiles available are water, aniline, and acetate. Water is there in great abundance and
does react with acetic anhydride but can’t compete with the other two as they are more basic
(by about 10[5]). If acetate attacks the anhydride, it simply regenerates acetate. But if aniline
attacks, the amide is formed as acetate is released.

The isolation of the product is easy as the amide is insoluble in water and can be fi ltered
off. Environmental considerations suggest that we should not use organic solvents so much
and should use water when possible. If we have some idea about pKas we can estimate
whether water will interfere in a reaction we are planning and decide whether it is a suitable solvent or not. It is even possible to acylate amines with the more reactive acid chlorides
in aqueous solution, and we will return in detail to acylation reactions such as these in
Chapter 10.

Histamine is an agonist in the
production of gastric acid. It
binds to specifi c sites (receptor
sites) in the stomach cells and
triggers the production of gastric
acid (mainly HCl).
An antagonist works by binding
to the receptor but not stimulating acid secretion. It therefore
inhibits acid secretion by blocking the receptor sites.


###### pKa in action—the development of the drug cimetidine

The development of the anti-peptic ulcer drug cimetidine gives a fascinating insight into the
important role of pKa in chemistry. Peptic ulcers are a localized erosion of the mucous membrane, resulting from overproduction of gastric acid in the stomach. One of the compounds
that controls the production of the acid is histamine. (Histamine is also responsible for the
symptoms of hay fever and allergies.)

cimetidine histamine

Histamine works by binding into a receptor in the stomach lining and stimulating the production of acid. What the developers of cimetidine at Smith, Kline and French wanted was a
drug that would bind to these receptors without activating them and thereby prevent histamine from binding but not stimulate acid secretion itself. Unfortunately, the antihistamine
drugs successfully used in the treatment of hay fever did not work—a different histamine
receptor was involved.
Notice that cimetidine and histamine both have the same nitrogen-containing ring (shown
in black) as part of their structures. This ring is known as an imidazole—imidazole itself is
quite a strong base whose protonated form is delocalized as shown below. This is not coincidence—cimetidine’s design was centred around the structure of histamine.

In the body, most histamine exists as a salt, being protonated on the primary amine and the
early compounds modelled this. The guanidine analogue was synthesized and tested to see if
it had any antagonistic effect (that is, if it could bind in the histamine receptors and prevent
histamine binding). It did bind but unfortunately it acted as an agonist rather than an antago_nist and stimulated acid secretion rather than blocking it. Since the guanidine analogue has a_
pKa even greater than histamine (about 14.5 compared to about 10), it is effectively all protonated at physiological pH.

but that amides aren’t. The
thiourea, and indeed a urea, is
more like an amide.


The agonistic behaviour of the drug clearly had to be suppressed. The thought occurred
to the chemists that perhaps the positive charge made the compound agonistic, and so a
polar but much less basic compound was sought. Eventually, they came up with burimamide. The most important change is the replacement of the C=NH in the guanidine
compound by C=S. Now instead of a guanidine we have a thiourea, which is much less
basic. Other adjustments were to increase the chain length, insert a second sulfur atom on
the chain, and add methyl groups to the thiourea and the imidazole ring, to give metiamide
with increased effi cacy.

The new drug, metiamide, was ten times more effective than burimamide when tested in
humans. However, there was an unfortunate side-effect: in some patients: the drug caused a
decrease in the number of white blood cells, leaving the patient open to infection. This was
eventually traced back to the thiourea group. The sulfur had again to be replaced by oxygen, to
give a normal urea and, just to see what would happen, by nitrogen to give another guanidine.

Neither was as effective as metiamide but the important discovery was that the guanidine
analogue no longer showed the agonistic effects of the earlier guanidine. Of course, the guanidine would also be protonated so we had the same problem we had earlier—how to decrease
the pKa of the guanidinium ion. A section of this chapter considered the effect of electronwithdrawing groups on pKa and showed that they make a base less basic. This was the approach
now adopted—the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups on to the guanidine to lower
its pKa. The table below shows the pKas of various substituted guanidinium ions.

Clearly, the cyano and nitro-substituted guanidines would not be protonated at all. These
were synthesized and found to be just as effective as metiamide but without the side-effects.
Of the two, the cyanoguanidine compound was slightly more effective and this was developed and named ‘cimetidine’.

(1879–1947) was a Danish physical chemist who, simultaneous
with Thomas Lowry, introduced
the protic theory of acid–base
reactions in 1923.


The development of cimetidine by Smith, Kline and French from the very start of the
project up to its launch on the market took 13 years. This enormous effort was well
rewarded—Tagamet (the trade name of the drug cimetidine) became the best-selling drug in
the world and the fi rst to gross more than one billion dollars per annum. Thousands of ulcer
patients worldwide no longer had to suffer pain, surgery, or even death. The development of
cimetidine followed a rational approach based on physiological and chemical principles and
it was for this that one of the scientists involved, Sir James Black, received a share of the 1988
Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. None of this would have been possible without an
understanding of pKas.

###### Lewis acids and bases

All the acids and bases we have been discussing so far have been protic, or Brønsted, acids and
bases. In fact, the defi nition of an acid and a base we gave you on p. 165 is a defi nition of a
Brønsted acid and a Brønsted base. When a carboxylic acid gives a proton to an amine, it is
acting as a Brønsted acid while the amine is a Brønsted base. The ammonium ion produced is
a Brønsted acid while the carboxylate anion is a Brønsted base.

**•** **Brønsted bases accept protons.**


The American chemist Gilbert
Lewis (1875–1946) introduced
his electronic theory of acid–
base interactions in 1924.


But there is another important type of acid: the Lewis acid. These acids don’t donate protons—indeed they usually have no protons to donate. Instead they accept electrons. It is
indeed a more general defi nition of acids to say that they accept electrons and of bases that
they donate electrons. Lewis acids are usually halides of the higher oxidation states of metals,
such as BF3, AlCl3, ZnCl2, SbF5, and TiCl4. By removing electrons from organic compounds,
Lewis acids act as important catalysts in important reactions such as the Friedel–Crafts alkylation and acylation of benzene (Chapter 21), the SN1 substitution reaction (Chapter 15), and
the Diels–Alder reaction (Chapter 34).



**•** **Lewis acids accept electrons.**

**•** **Lewis bases donate electrons.**


A simple Lewis acid is BF3. As you saw in Chapter 5, monomeric boron compounds have
three bonds to other atoms and an empty p orbital, making six electrons only in the outer
shell. They are therefore not stable and BF3 is normally used as its ‘etherate’: a complex with
Et2O. Ether donates a pair of electrons into the empty p orbital of BF3 and this complex has
tetrahedral boron with eight electrons. In this reaction the ether donates electrons (it can be
described as a Lewis base) and BF3 accepts electrons: it is a Lewis acid. No protons are
exchanged. The complex is a stable liquid and is the form usually available from suppliers.

Lewis acids often form strong interactions with electronegative atoms such as halides or

removes the chloride ion from an acyl chloride to give a species, the acylium ion, which is
reactive enough to combine with benzene.

Lewis acid–base interactions are very common in chemistry and are often rather subtle. You
are about to meet, in the next chapter, an important way of making C–C bonds by adding
organometallics to carbonyl compounds, and in many of these reactions there is an interaction at some point between a Lewis acidic metal cation and a Lewis basic carbonyl group.

###### Introduction

In Chapters 2–8 we covered basic chemical concepts concerning structure (Chapters 2–4 and
7) and reactivity (Chapters 5, 6, and 8). These concepts are the bare bones supporting all of
organic chemistry, and now we shall start to put fl esh on these bare bones. In Chapters 9–22
we shall tell you about the most important classes of organic reaction in more detail.
One of the things organic chemists do, for all sorts of reasons, is to make molecules, and
making organic molecules means making C–C bonds. In this chapter we are going to look at
one of the most important ways of making C–C bonds: using organometallics, such as organolithiums and Grignard reagents, in combination with carbonyl compounds. We will consider
reactions such as these:

electrophilic carbonyl group, and this is the fi rst thing we need to discuss: why are organometallics nucleophilic? We then move on to, fi rstly, how to make organometallics, then to
the sorts of electrophiles they will react with, and fi nally to the sort of molecules we can
make with them.

###### Organometallic compounds contain a carbon–metal bond

The polarity of a covalent bond between two different elements is determined by electronegativity. The more electronegative an element is, the more it attracts the electron density in the
bond. So the greater the difference between the electronegativities, the greater the difference
between the attraction for the bonding electrons, and the more polarized the bond becomes.
In the extreme case of complete polarization, the covalent bond ceases to exist and is replaced
by electrostatic attraction between ions of opposite charge. We discussed this in Chapter 4
(p. 96), where we considered the extreme cases of bonding in NaCl.

###### How important are organometallics for making C–C bonds?

As an example, let’s take a molecule known as ‘juvenile hormone’. It is a compound that prevents several species of
insects from maturing and can be used as a means of controlling insect pests. Only very small amounts of the naturally
occurring compound can be isolated from the insects, but it can instead be made in the laboratory from simple starting
materials. At this stage you need not worry about how, but we can tell you that, in one synthesis, of the 16 C–C bonds
in the fi nal product, seven were made by reactions of organometallic reagents, many of them the sort of reactions we
will describe in this chapter. This is not an isolated example. As further proof, take an important enzyme inhibitor, closely
related to arachidonic acid which you met in Chapter 7. It has been made by a succession of C–C bond-forming reactions
using organometallic reagents: eight of the 20 C–C bonds in the product were formed using organometallic reactions.

When we discussed (in Chapter 6) the electrophilic nature of carbonyl groups we saw that
their reactivity is a direct consequence of the polarization of the carbon–oxygen bond
towards the more electronegative oxygen, making the carbon a site for nucleophilic attack. In
Chapter 6 you also met the two most important organometallic compounds—organolithiums
and organomagnesium halides (known as Grignard reagents). In these organometallic reagents the key bond is polarized in the opposite direction—towards carbon—making carbon a
nucleophilic centre. This is true for most organometallics because, as you can see from this
edited version of the periodic table, metals (such as Li, Mg, Na, and Al) all have lower electronegativity than carbon.

The molecular orbital energy level diagram—the kind you met in Chapter 4—represents the
C–Li bond in methyllithium in terms of the sum of the atomic orbitals of carbon and lithium.
The more electronegative an atom is, the lower in energy are its atomic orbitals (p. 96). The
fi lled C–Li σ orbital is closer in energy to the carbon’s sp[3] orbital than to the lithium’s 2s
orbital, so we can say that the carbon’s sp[3] orbital makes a greater contribution to the C–Li σ
bond and that the C–Li bond has a larger coeffi cient on carbon. Reactions involving the fi lled


-----

σ orbital will therefore take place at C rather than Li. The same arguments hold for the C–Mg
bond of organo-magnesium or Grignard reagents, named after their inventor Victor Grignard.

You have already met cyanide
(p. 121), a carbanion that really
does have a lone pair on carbon.
Cyanide’s lone pair is stabilized
by being in a lower-energy sp
orbital (rather than sp3) and by
having the electronegative
nitrogen atom triply bonded to
the carbon.

We can also say that, because the carbon’s sp[3] orbital makes a greater contribution to the
C–Li σ bond, the σ bond is close in structure to a fi lled C sp[3] orbital—a lone pair on carbon.
This useful idea can be carried too far: methyl lithium is not an ionic compound Me[−]Li[+]—
although you may sometimes see MeLi or MeMgCl represented in mechanisms as Me[−].


**The true structure of organolithiums and Grignard reagents is rather more complicated! Even though these**
organometallic compounds are extremely reactive towards water and oxygen, and have to be handled under an atmosphere of nitrogen or argon, some have been studied by X-ray crystallography in the solid state and by NMR in solution.
It turns out that they generally form complex aggregates with two, four, six, or more molecules bonded together, often
with solvent molecules, one reason why apparently polar compounds such as BuLi dissolve in hydrocarbons. In this book
we shall not be concerned with these details, and we shall represent organometallic compounds as simple monomeric
structures.

 How to make Grignard reagents

Grignard reagents are made by reacting magnesium turnings with alkyl halides in ether solvents to form solutions of alkylmagnesium halide. Iodides, bromides, and chlorides can be
used, as can both aryl and alkyl halides. Our examples include methyl, primary, secondary,
and tertiary alkyl halides, aryl and allyl halides. They cannot contain any functional groups
that would react with the Grignard reagent once it is formed. The fi nal example has an acetal
functional group as an example of one that does not react with the Grignard reagent. (See
Chapter 23 for further discussion.)

The reaction scheme is easy enough to draw, but what is the mechanism? Overall it involves
an insertion of magnesium into the carbon–halogen bond. There is also a change in oxidation
state of the magnesium, from Mg(0) to Mg(II). The reaction is therefore known as an oxidative insertion or oxidative addition, and is a general process for many metals such as Mg, Li
(which we meet shortly), Cu, and Zn. Mg(II) is much more stable than Mg(0) and this drives
the reaction.
The mechanism of the reaction is not completely understood, and probably involves radical
intermediates. But what is sure is that by the end of the reaction the magnesium has surrendered its lone pair of electrons and gained two σ bonds. The true product is a complex between
the Grignard reagent and, probably, two molecules of the ether solvent, as Mg(II) prefers a
tetrahedral structure.

###### More on making Grignard reagents

The reaction takes place not in solution but on the surface of the metal, and how easy it is to make a Grignard reagent
can depend on the state of the surface—how fi nely divided the metal is, for example. Magnesium is usually covered by
a thin coating of magnesium oxide, and Grignard formation generally requires ‘initiation’ to allow the metal to come into
direct contact with the alkyl halide. Initiation usually means adding a small amount of iodine or 1,2-diiodoethane, or
using ultrasound to dislodge the oxide layer. Once the Grignard starts to form, it catalyses further reactions of Mg(0),
perhaps by this mechanism:

###### How to make organolithium reagents

Organolithium compounds may be made by a similar oxidative insertion reaction from lithium metal and alkyl halides. Each inserting reaction requires two atoms of lithium and generates one equivalent of lithium halide salt. As with Grignard formation, there is really very
little limit on the types of organolithium that can be made this way.

You will notice secondary alkyllithiums, an aryllithium, and two vinyllithiums. The only
other functional groups are alkenes and an ether. So far, that is quite like the formation of
Grignard reagents. However, there are differences. Lithium goes from Li(0) to Li(I) during the


-----

reaction and there is no halide attached to the Li. Instead a second Li atom has to be used to
make the Li halide. Again, Li(I) is very much more stable than Li(0) so the reaction is irreversible. Although ether solvents are often used, there is less need for extra coordination and
hydrocarbon solvents such as pentane or hexane are also good.

###### Commercially available organometallics

Some Grignard and organolithium reagents are commercially available. Most chemists (unless they were working on a
very large scale) would not usually make the simpler organolithiums or Grignard reagents by these methods, but would
buy them in bottles from chemical companies (who, of course, do use these methods). The table lists some of the most
important commercially available organolithiums and Grignard reagents.

###### Organometallics as bases

Organometallics need to be kept absolutely free of moisture—even moisture in the air will
destroy them. The reason is that they react very rapidly and highly exothermically with water
to produce alkanes. Anything that can protonate them will do the same thing. The organometallic reagent is a strong base, and is protonated to form its conjugate acid—methane or
benzene in these cases. The pKa of methane (Chapter 8) is somewhere around 50: it isn’t an
acid at all and essentially nothing will remove a proton from methane.


**Li** **Me**

**H**


**BrMg** **Ph**

The equilibria lie vastly to the right: methane and Li[+] are much more stable than MeLi while
benzene and Mg[2][+] are much more stable than PhMgBr. Some of the most important uses of
organolithiums—butyllithium, in particular—are as bases and, because they are so strong,
they will deprotonate almost anything. That makes them very useful as reagents for making
_other organolithiums._

###### Making organometallics by deprotonating alkynes

In Chapter 8 (p. 175) we talked about how hybridization affects acidity. Alkynes, with their
C–H bonds formed from sp orbitals, are the most acidic of hydrocarbons, with pKas of about 25.


-----

They can be deprotonated by more basic organometallics such as butyllithium or ethylmagnesium bromide. Alkynes are suffi ciently acidic to be deprotonated even by nitrogen bases and
you saw on p. 171 that a common way of deprotonating alkynes is to use NaNH2 (sodium
amide), obtained by reacting sodium with liquid ammonia. An example of each is shown here.
Propyne and acetylene are gases, and can be bubbled through a solution of the base.

The metal derivatives of alkynes can be added to carbonyl electrophiles, as in the following
examples. The fi rst (we have reminded you of the mechanism for this) is the initial step of an
important synthesis of the antibiotic erythronolide A, and the second is the penultimate step
of a synthesis of the widespread natural product farnesol.



- We have chosen to represent
the alkynyl lithium and alkynyl
magnesium halides as
organometallics and the alkynyl
sodium as an ionic salt. Both
probably have some covalent
character but lithium is less
electropositive than sodium so
alkynyl lithiums are more
covalent and usually used in
non-polar solvents while the
sodium derivatives are more
ionic and usually used in polar
solvents.

###### Halogen–metal exchange

Deprotonation is not the only way to use one simple organometallic reagent to generate
another more useful one. Organolithiums can also remove halogen atoms from alkyl and aryl
halides in a reaction known as halogen–metal exchange.

The bromine and the lithium simply swap places. As with many of these organometallic
processes, the mechanism is not altogether clear, but can be represented as a nucleophilic
attack on bromine by the butyllithium. But why does the reaction work? The product of our
‘mechanism’ is not PhLi and BuBr but a phenyl anion and a lithium cation. These could obviously combine to give PhLi and BuBr. But is this a reasonable interpretation and why does the
reaction go that way and not the other? The key, again, is pKa. We can think of the organolithiums as a complex between Li[+] and a carbanion.

- The reason for this is again
that the anion lies in an sp[2]
orbital rather than an sp[3]
orbital. See Chapter 8, p. 175.


The lithium cation is the same in all cases: only the carbanion varies. So the stability of the
complex depends on the stability of the carbanion ligand. Benzene, (pKa about 43) is more
acidic than butane (pKa about 50) so the phenyl complex is more stable than the butyl complex and the reaction is a way to make PhLi from available BuLi. Vinyllithiums (the lithium
must be bonded directly to the alkene) can also be made this way and a R2N– substituent is
acceptable. Bromides or iodides react faster than chlorides.

Halogen–metal exchange tolls the knell of one appealing way to make carbon–carbon

σ bond.

This reaction does not work because of transmetallation. The two alkyl bromides and their

successful, three coupled products will be formed.

**R[1]** **MgBr** + **R[2]** **Br** **R[1]** **Br** + **R[2]** **MgBr**

You will see later that transition metals are needed for this sort of reaction. The only successful reactions of this kind are couplings between metal derivatives of alkynes and alkyl
halides. These do not exchange the metal as the alkynyl metal is much more stable than the
alkyl metal.
A good example is the synthesis of a substituted alkyne starting from acetylene (ethyne)
itself. One alkylation uses NaNH2 as the base to make sodium acetylide and the other uses
BuLi to make a lithium acetylide.

###### Using organometallics to make organic molecules

Now that you have met all of the most important ways of making organometallics (summarized here as a reminder), we shall move on to consider how to use them to make molecules:


-----

what sorts of electrophiles do they react with and what sorts of products can we expect to get
from their reactions? Having told you how you can make other organometallics, we shall
really be concerned for the rest of this chapter only with Grignard reagents and organolithiums. In nearly all of the cases we shall talk about, the two classes of organometallics can
be used interchangeably.

###### Making carboxylic acids from organometallics and carbon dioxide

Carbon dioxide reacts with organolithiums and Grignard reagents to give carboxylate
salts. Protonating the salt with acid gives a carboxylic acid with one more carbon
atom than the starting organometallic. The reaction is usually done by adding solid CO2 to
a solution of the organolithium in THF or ether, but it can also be done using a stream of

The example belows shows the three stages of the reaction: (1) forming the organometallic,
(2) reaction with the electrophile (CO2), and (3) the acidic work-up or quench, which
protonates the product and destroys any unreacted organometallic. The three stages of


-----

the reaction have to be monitored carefully to make sure that each is fi nished before the next
is begun. In particular it is absolutely essential that there is no water present during either
of the fi rst two stages—water must be added only at the end of the reaction, after the organometallic has all been consumed by reaction with the electrophile. You may occasionally
see schemes written out without the quenching step included, but it is nonetheless
always needed.

###### Making primary alcohols from organometallics and formaldehyde

You met formaldehyde, the simplest aldehyde, in Chapter 6, where we discussed the diffi culties of using it in anhydrous reactions: it is either hydrated or a polymer paraformaldehyde,
(CH2O)n, and in order to get pure, dry formaldehyde it is necessary to heat (‘crack’) the polymer to decompose it. But formaldehyde is a remarkably useful reagent for making primary
alcohols, in other words alcohols that have just one carbon substituent on the hydroxybearing C atom. Just as carbon dioxide adds one carbon and makes an acid, formaldehyde
adds one carbon and makes an alcohol.

In the next two examples, formaldehyde makes a primary alcohol from two deprotonated

of the synthesis of Cecropia juvenile hormone, whose structure you met right at the beginning

###### Secondary and tertiary alcohols: which organometallic, which aldehyde, which ketone?

To make any secondary alcohol, however, there may be a choice of two possible routes,
depending on which part of the molecule you choose to make the organometallic and which
part you choose to make the aldehyde. For example, the fi rst example here shows the synthesis of a secondary alcohol from isopropylmagnesium chloride and acetaldehyde. But it is


-----

equally possible to make this same secondary alcohol from isobutyraldehyde and methyllithium or a methylmagnesium halide.

Indeed, back in 1912, when this alcohol was fi rst described in detail, the chemists who made
it chose to start with acetaldehyde, while in 1983, when it was needed as a starting material
for a synthesis, it was made from isobutyraldehyde. Which way is better? The 1983 chemists
probably chose the isobutyraldehyde route because it gave a better yield. But, if you were making a secondary alcohol for the fi rst time, you might just have to try both in the laboratory and
see which one gave a better yield.
Or you might be more concerned about which uses the cheaper, or more readily available, starting materials—this was probably also a factor in the choice of methylmagnesium
chloride and the unsaturated aldehyde in the second example. Both can be bought
commercially, while the alternative route to this secondary alcohol would require a
vinyllithium or vinylmagnesium bromide reagent that would have to be made from a
vinyl halide, which is itself not commercially available, along with diffi cult-to-dry
acetaldehyde.

There is another choice for secondary alcohols: the reduction of a ketone. The ketone reacts
with sodium borohydride to give a secondary alcohol. An obvious case where this would be a
good route is the synthesis of a cyclic alcohol. This bicyclic ketone gives the secondary alcohol
in good yield, and in the second example a diketone has both its carbonyl groups reduced.

With tertiary alcohols, there is even more choice. The example below is a step in a synthesis

Only the reagents in orange are commercially available, but, as it happens, the green
Grignard reagent can be made from an alkyl bromide, which is itself commercially available,
making route 1 on the left the most reasonable.
Now, do not be dismayed! We are not expecting you to remember a chemical catalogue
and to know which compounds you can buy and which you can’t. All we want you to
appreciate at this stage is that there are usually two or three ways of making any given secondary or tertiary alcohol, and you should be able to suggest alternative combinations of
aldehyde or ketone and Grignard or organolithium reagent that will give the same product.
You are not expected to be able to assess the relative merits of the different possible routes
to a compound. That is a topic we leave for a much later chapter on retrosynthetic analysis,
Chapter 28.

###### Oxidation of alcohols

So far the metals we have used have had one oxidation state other than zero: Li(I), Mg(II), and
Zn(II). If we want to oxidize organic compounds we need metals that have at least two higher
oxidation states and that means transition metals. The most important by far is chromium,
with Cr(III) and Cr(VI) as the useful oxidation states. Orange Cr(VI) compounds are good oxidizing agents: they remove hydrogen from organic compounds and are themselves reduced to
green Cr(III). There are many Cr(VI) reagents used in organic chemistry, some of the more
important ones are related to the polymeric oxide CrO3. This is the anhydride of chromic acid
and water breaks up the polymer to give a solution of chromic acid. Pyridine also breaks up the
polymer to give a complex. This (Collins’ reagent) was used to oxidize organic compounds but
it is rather unstable and pyridinium dichromate (PDC) and pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)
are usually now preferred, especially as they are soluble in organic solvents such as CH2Cl2.

Oxidation by these reagents of the various primary and secondary alcohols we have been
making in this chapter takes us to a higher oxidation level. Oxidation of primary alcohols
gives aldehydes and then carboxylic acids, while oxidation of secondary alcohols gives
ketones. Note that you can’t oxidize tertiary alcohols (without breaking a C–C bond).

You will notice that the oxidation steps involve the removal of two hydrogen atoms and/or
the addition of one oxygen atom. In Chapter 6 you saw that reduction meant the addition of
hydrogen (and can also mean the removal of oxygen). Hiding behind these observations is the
more fundamental idea that reduction requires the addition of electrons while oxidation
requires the removal of electrons. If we used basic reagents, we could remove the OH proton
from a primary alcohol, but to get the aldehyde we should have to remove a C–H proton as
well with a pair of electrons. We should have to expel a hydride ion H[−] and this doesn’t happen.
So we need some reagent that can remove a hydrogen atom and a pair of electrons. That defi nes
an oxidizing agent.

Here Cr(VI) can remove electrons to make Cr(III). It does so by a cyclic mechanism on a
Cr(VI) ester. One hydrogen atom is removed (from the OH group) to make the ester and the
second is removed (from carbon) in the cyclic mechanism. Notice how the arrows stop on the
Cr atom and start again on the Cr=O bond, so two electrons are added to the chromium. This
actually makes Cr(IV), an unstable oxidation state, but this gives green Cr(III) by further
reactions.

Two examples of the use of PCC in these oxidations come from Vogel. Hexanol is oxidized
to hexanal in dichloromethane solution and commercial carveol (an impure natural product)
to pure carvone with PCC supported on alumina in hexane solution. In both cases the pure
aldehyde or ketone was isolated by distillation.

But a word of warning: stronger oxidizing agents like calcium hypochlorite or sodium
hypochlorite (bleach) may oxidize primary alcohols all the way to carboxylic acids, especially
in water. This is the case with p-chloro benzyl alcohol and the solid acid is easily isolated by
the type of acid/base extraction we met in the previous chapter.

You will fi nd further discussion of oxidizing agents in later chapters of the book. We have
introduced them here so that you can see how primary and secondary alcohols, made by addition of organometallic reagents, can be oxidized to aldehydes or ketones so that the process
can be repeated. A secondary alcohol, which could be made in two ways, can be oxidized with
the pyridine–CrO3 complex to the ketone and reacted with any Grignard or organolithium
compound to give a range of tertiary alcohols.

###### Looking forward


secondary alcohol ketone, 97% yield tertiary alcohol


In this chapter we have covered interconversions between ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols by
forming C–C bonds using organometallics. We looked at oxidation and reduction as ways of
complementing these methods—you should now be able to suggest at least one way of making
any primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohol from simple precursors. In the next two chapters
we will broaden our horizons beyond aldehydes and ketones to look at the reactivity of other
carbonyl compounds—carboxylic acids and their derivatives such as esters and amides—and
other nucleophiles. But the idea that we study organic reactions not only for their own sake
but also so we can use them to make things should stay with you. We will come back to how
to design ways of making molecules in Chapter 28. Many of these methods will employ the
organometallics you have just met. We will then devote Chapter 40 to a broader range of more
complex organometallic methods.

                         - How to reduce acids to alcohols

You are already familiar with reactions of compounds containing carbonyl groups. Aldehydes
and ketones react with nucleophiles at the carbon atom of their carbonyl group to give products containing hydroxyl groups. Because the carbonyl group is such a good electrophile, it
reacts with a wide range of different nucleophiles: you have met reactions of aldehydes and
ketones with (in Chapter 6) cyanide, water, and alcohols, and (in Chapter 9) organometallic
reagents (organolithiums and organomagnesiums, or Grignard reagents).
In this chapter and Chapter 11 we shall look at some more reactions of the carbonyl group—
and revisit some of the ones we touched on in Chapter 6. It is a tribute to the importance of
this functional group for organic chemistry that we have devoted four chapters of this book
to its reactions. Just like the reactions in Chapters 6 and 9, the reactions in Chapters 10 and 11
all involve attack of a nucleophile on a carbonyl group. The difference is that this step is followed by other mechanistic steps, which means that the overall reactions are not just addi_tions but also substitutions._

###### The product of nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group is not always a stable compound

Addition of a Grignard reagent to an aldehyde or ketone gives a stable alkoxide, which can be
protonated with acid to produce an alcohol (you met this reaction in Chapter 9). The same is
not true for addition of an alcohol to a carbonyl group in the presence of base—in Chapter 6
we drew a reversible, equilibrium arrow for this transformation and said that the product, a
hemiacetal, is formed to a signifi cant extent only if it is cyclic.
The reason for this instability is that RO[−] is easily expelled from the molecule. We call groups
that can be expelled from molecules, usually taking with them a negative charge, **leaving**
**groups. We’ll look at leaving groups in more detail later in this chapter and again in Chapter 15.**

**Leaving groups are anions such as Cl[−], RO[−], and RCO2[−] that can be expelled from molecules**
**taking their negative charge with them.**


So, if the nucleophile is also a leaving group, there is a chance that it will be lost again and
that the carbonyl group will reform—in other words, the reaction will be reversible. The
energy released in forming the C=O bond (bond strength 720 kJ mol[−][1]) makes up for the loss
of two C–O single bonds (about 350 kJ mol[−][1] each), one of the reasons for the instability of the
hemiacetal product in this case.
The same thing can happen if the starting carbonyl compound contains a potential leaving
group. The unstable negatively charged intermediate in the red box below is formed when a
Grignard reagent is added to an ester.

Again, it collapses with loss of RO[−] as a leaving group. This time, though, we have not gone
back to starting materials: instead we have made a new compound (a ketone) by a substitu**tion reaction—the OR group of the starting material has been substituted by the Me group of**
the product. In fact the ketone product can react with the Grignard reagent a second time
to give a tertiary alcohol. Later in this chapter we’ll discuss why the reaction doesn’t stop at
the ketone.

###### Carboxylic acid derivatives

Most of the starting materials for, and products of, these substitutions will be carboxylic acid
derivatives, with the general formula RCOX. You met the most important members of this
class in Chapter 2: here they are again as a reminder.

*We shall use these two terms interchangeably.

###### Acid chlorides and acid anhydrides react with alcohols to make esters

In each case, a substitution (of the black part of the molecule, Cl[−] or AcO[−], by cyclohexanol)
has taken place—but how? It is important that you learn not only the fact that acyl chlorides
and acid anhydrides react with alcohols but also the mechanism of the reaction. In this chapter
you will meet a lot of reactions, but relatively few mechanisms—once you understand one,
you should fi nd that the rest follow on quite logically.
The fi rst step of the reaction is, as you might expect, addition of the nucleophilic alcohol to
the electrophilic carbonyl group—we’ll take the acyl chloride fi rst. The base is important
because it removes the proton from the alcohol once it attacks the carbonyl group. A base
commonly used for this is pyridine. If the electrophile had been an aldehyde or a ketone, we
would have got an unstable hemiacetal, which would collapse back to starting materials by
eliminating the alcohol. With an acyl chloride, the alkoxide intermediate we get is also unstable. It collapses again by an elimination reaction, this time losing chloride ion, to form the
ester. Chloride is the leaving group here—it leaves with its negative charge.



- Remember the symbol for
acetyl? Ac=CH3CO. You can
represent the acetate of an
alcohol ROH as ROAc but not as
RAc as this would be a ketone.



- You will notice that the
terms ‘acid chloride’ and ‘acyl
chloride’ are used
interchangeably.

With this reaction as a model, you should be able to work out the mechanism of ester formation from acetic anhydride and an alcohol. Try to write it down without looking at the acyl
chloride mechanism above, and certainly not at the answer below. Here it is, with pyridine as
the base. Again, addition of the nucleophile gives an unstable intermediate, which undergoes
an elimination reaction, this time losing a carboxylate anion to give an ester.

Tetrahedral intermediates are similarly formed by addition of a nucleophile, say ethanol in
base, to the carbonyl group of acetyl chloride, but these tetrahedral intermediates are unstable.
Why are they unstable? The answer is to do with leaving group ability. Once the nucleophile
has added to the carbonyl compound, the stability of the product (or tetrahedral intermediate)
depends on how good the groups attached to the new tetrahedral carbon atom are at leaving
with the negative charge. In order for the tetrahedral intermediate to collapse (and therefore be
just an intermediate and not the fi nal product) one of the groups has to be able to leave and
carry off the negative charge from the alkoxide anion formed in the addition.

The most stable anion will be the best leaving group. There were three choices for the leaving group: Cl[−], EtO[−], or Me[−]. We can make MeLi but not Me[−] because it is very unstable so
Me[−] must be a very bad leaving group. EtO[−] is not so bad—alkoxide salts are stable, but they
are still strong, reactive bases. But Cl[−] is the best leaving group: Cl[−] ions are perfectly stable
and quite unreactive, and happily carry off the negative charge from the oxygen atom.

You probably eat several grams of Cl[−] every day but you would be unwise to eat EtO[−] or MeLi.

###### How do we know that the tetrahedral intermediate exists?

We don’t expect you to be satisfi ed with the bland statement that tetrahedral intermediates
are formed in these reactions: of course, you wonder how we know that this is true. The fi rst
evidence for tetrahedral intermediates in the substitution reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives was provided by Bender in 1951. He made carboxylic acid derivatives RCOX that had
been ‘labelled’ with an isotope of oxygen, [18]O. This is a non-radioactive isotope that is detected
by mass spectrometry. He then reacted these derivatives with water to make labelled carboxylic acids. By any reasonable mechanism, the products would have one [18]O atom from the
labelled starting material. Because the proton on a carboxylic acid migrates rapidly from one
oxygen to another, both oxygens are labelled equally.

- In Bender’s original work, X
was an alkoxy group (i.e. RCOX
was an ester).


He then reacted these derivatives with insuffi cient water for complete consumption of the
starting material. At the end of the reaction, he found that the proportion of labelled molecules
in the remaining starting material had decreased signifi cantly: in other words, it was no longer
completely labelled with [18]O; some contained ‘normal’ [16]O. The formation of the tetrahedral
intermediate would be as before but rapid proton transfer would also mean that the two oxygen atoms would be the same. Now you may see the next step in the argument.

This result cannot be explained by direct substitution of X by H2O, but is consistent with
the existence of an intermediate in which the unlabelled [16]O and labelled [18]O can ‘change
places’. This intermediate is the tetrahedral intermediate for this reaction. Either isomer can lose
X and in each case labelled carboxylic acid is formed.

But either tetrahedral intermediate could lose water instead. In one case (top line below) the
original starting material is regenerated complete with label. But in the second case, labelled
water is lost and unlabelled starting material is formed. This result would be diffi cult to explain
without a tetrahedral intermediate with a lifetime long enough to allow for proton exchange.
This ‘addition–elimination’ mechanism is now universally accepted.

###### pKa is a useful guide to leaving group ability

It’s useful to be able to compare leaving group ability quantitatively. This is impossible to do
exactly, but a good guide is the pKa of the conjugate acid (Chapter 8). If X[−] is the leaving group,
the lower the pKa of HX, the better X[−] is as a leaving group. If we go back to the example of
ester formation from acyl chloride plus alcohol, there’s a choice of Me[−], EtO[−], and Cl[−]. HCl is
a stronger acid than EtOH, which is a much stronger acid than methane. So Cl[−] is the best
leaving group and EtO[−] the next best. These observations apply only to reactions at the carbonyl group.



- **Leaving group ability**

**The lower the pKa of HX, the better the leaving group of X[−] in carbonyl substitution reactions.**


The most important substituents in carbonyl reactions are alkyl or aryl groups (R), amino
groups in amides (NH2), alkoxy groups in esters (RO[−]), carboxylate groups (RCO2−) in anhydrides, and chloride (Cl[−]) in acyl chlorides. The order of leaving group ability is then:

carboxylic acid derivative leaving group, X[−] conjugate acid, HX pKa of HX leaving group?

acyl chloride Cl[–] HCl <0 excellent

anhydride RCOO[−] RCO2H about 5 good

ester RO[−] ROH about 15 poor

amide NH2− NH3 about 25 very poor

alkyl or aryl derivative R[−] RH >40 not a leaving group

We can use pKa to predict what happens if we react an acyl chloride with a carboxylate salt.
We expect the carboxylate salt (here, sodium formate or sodium methanoate, HCO2Na) to act
as the nucleophile to form a tetrahedral intermediate, which could collapse in any one of
three ways. We can straightaway rule out loss of Me[−] and we might guess that Cl[−] is a better
leaving group than HCO2− as HCl is a much stronger acid than a carboxylic acid, and we’d be
right. Sodium formate reacts with acetyl chloride to give a mixed anhydride.

###### Amines react with acyl chlorides to give amides

Using the principles we’ve outlined above, you should be able to see how these compounds
can be interconverted by substitution reactions with appropriate nucleophiles. We’ve seen
that acid chlorides react with carboxylic acids to give acid anhydrides, and with alcohols to
give esters. They also react with amines (such as ammonia) to give amides.

###### Schotten–Baumann synthesis of an amide

As these mechanisms show, the formation of amides from acid chlorides and amines is accompanied by production
of one equivalent of HCl, which needs to be neutralized by a second equivalent of amine. An alternative method for
making amides is to carry out the reaction in the presence of another base, such as NaOH, which then does the job
of neutralizing the HCl. The trouble is, OH[−] also attacks acyl chlorides to give carboxylic acids. Schotten and
Baumann, in the late nineteenth century, published a way round this problem by carrying out these reactions in
two-phase systems of immiscible water and dichloromethane. The organic amine (not necessarily ammonia) and the
acyl chloride remain in the (lower) dichloromethane layer, while the base (NaOH) remains in the (upper) aqueous
layer. Dichloromethane and chloroform are two common organic solvents that are heavier (more dense) than water.
The acyl chloride reacts only with the amine, but the HCl produced can dissolve in, and be neutralized by, the aqueous solution of NaOH.

###### Using base strength to predict the outcome of substitution reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives

You saw that acid anhydrides react with alcohols to give esters: they will also react with
amines to give amides. But would you expect esters to react with amines to give amides, or
amides to react with alcohols to give esters? Both appear reasonable.

In fact only the top reaction works: amides can be formed from esters but esters cannot be
formed from amides. The key question is: which group will leave from the common tetrahedral
intermediate? The answer is MeO[−] and not NH2−. You should have worked this out from the
stability of the anions. Alkoxides are reasonably strong bases (pKa of ROH about 15) so they are
not good leaving groups. But NH2− is a very unstable anion (pKa of NH3 about 25) and is a very
bad leaving group.

###### Factors other than leaving group ability can be important

In fact, the tetrahedral intermediate would simply never form from an amide and an alcohol;
the amide is too bad an electrophile and the alcohol not a good enough nucleophile. We’ve
looked at leaving group ability: next we’ll consider the strength of the nucleophile Y and then
the strength of the electrophile RCOX.


-----

###### Strength of nucleophile and leaving group ability are related and pKa is a guide to both

We have seen how pKa gives us a guide to leaving group ability: it is also a good guide to how
strong a nucleophile will be. These two properties are the reverse of each other: good nucleophiles are bad leaving groups. A stable anion is a good leaving group but a poor nucleophile.
Anions of weak acids (HA has high pKa) are bad leaving groups but good nucleophiles towards
the carbonyl group.



- **Guide to nucleophilicity**

**In general, the higher the pKa of AH the better A[−] is as a nucleophile.**


But just a moment—we’ve overlooked an important point. We have sometimes used anions
as nucleophiles (for example when we made acid anhydrides from acid chlorides plus carboxylate salts, we used an anionic nucleophile RCO2−) but on other occasions we have used
neutral nucleophiles (for example when we made amides from acid chlorides plus amines, we
used a neutral nucleophile NH3). Anions are better nucleophiles for carbonyl groups than are
neutral compounds so we can choose our nucleophilic reagent accordingly.
For proper comparisons, we should use the pKa of NH4+ (about 10) if we are using neutral
ammonia, but the pKa of RCO2H (about 5) if we’re using the carboxylate anion. Ammonia is a
good nucleophile and we don’t usually need its anion but carboxylic acids are very weak
nucleophiles and we often use their anions. You will see later in this chapter that we can alter
this with acid catalysts. So this reaction works badly in either direction. We don’t make or
hydrolyse esters this way.

While amines react with acetic anhydride quite rapidly at room temperature (reaction complete in a few hours), alcohols react extremely slowly in the absence of a base. On the other
hand, an alkoxide anion reacts with acetic anhydride extremely rapidly—the reactions are
often complete within seconds at 0 °C. We don’t have to deprotonate an alcohol completely
to increase its reactivity: just a catalytic quantity of a weak base can do this job. All the pKas
you need are in Chapter 8.

###### Not all carboxylic acid derivatives are equally reactive

We can list the common carboxylic acid derivatives in a ‘hierarchy’ of reactivity, with the
most reactive at the top and the least reactive at the bottom. The nucleophile is the same
in each case (water), as is the product, the carboxylic acid, but the electrophiles vary from
very reactive to unreactive. The conditions needed for successful reaction show just how
large is the variation on reactivity. Acid chlorides react violently with water. Amides need
refl uxing with 10% NaOH or concentrated HCl in a sealed tube at 100 °C overnight. We’ve
seen that this hierarchy is partly due to how good the leaving group is (the ones at the top
are best). But it also depends on the reactivity of the acid derivatives. Why is there such a
large difference?

###### Delocalization and the electrophilicity of carbonyl compounds

Amides are the least reactive towards nucleophiles because they exhibit the greatest degree of
delocalization. You met this concept in Chapter 7 and we shall return to it many times more.
In an amide, the lone pair on the nitrogen atom can be stabilized by overlap with the π*
orbital of the carbonyl group—this overlap is best when the lone pair occupies a p orbital (in
an amine, it would occupy an sp[3] orbital).

The molecular orbital diagram shows how this interaction both lowers the energy of the
bonding orbital (the delocalized nitrogen lone pair), making it neither basic nor nucleophilic,
and raises the energy of the π* orbital, making it less ready to react with nucleophiles. Esters
are similar, but because the oxygen lone pairs are lower in energy, the effect is less pronounced.
The degree of delocalization depends on the electron-donating power of the substituent and
increases along the series of compounds below from almost no delocalization from Cl to complete delocalization in the carboxylate anion, where the negative charge is equally shared
between the two oxygen atoms.

The greater the degree of delocalization, the weaker the C=O bond becomes. This is
most clearly evident in the stretching frequency of the carbonyl group in the IR spectra of


-----

carboxylic acid derivatives—remember that the stretching frequency depends on the force
constant of the bond, itself a measure of the bond’s strength. The carboxylate anion is included
because it represents the limit of the series, with complete delocalization of the negative charge
over the two oxygen atoms. There are two frequencies for the anhydride and the carboxylate
anion because of symmetric and antisymmetric stretching of identical bonds.
Amides react as electrophiles only with powerful nucleophiles such as HO[−]. Acid chlorides,
on the other hand, react with even quite weak nucleophiles: neutral ROH, for example. They
are more reactive because the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine atom increases the
electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon atom.

###### Bond strengths and reactivity

You may think that a weaker C=O bond should be more reactive. This is not so because the partial positive charge on
carbon is also lessened by delocalization and because the molecule as a whole is stabilized by the delocalization. Bond
strength is not always a good guide to reactivity!
For example, in acetic acid the bond strengths are surprising. The strongest bond is the O–H bond and the weakest is
the C–C bond. Yet very few reactions of acetic acid involve breaking the C–C bond, and its characteristic reactivity, as
an acid, involves breaking O–H, the strongest bond of them all!
The reason is that polarization of bonds and solvation of ions play an enormously important role in determining the
reactivity of molecules. In Chapter 37 you will see that radicals are relatively unaffected by solvation and that their reactions follow bond strengths much more closely.

###### Carboxylic acids do not undergo substitution reactions under basic conditions

Substitution reactions of RCO2H require a leaving group OH[−]. The pKa of water is about 15, so
acids should be about as electrophilic as esters. Esters react well with ammonia to give amides.
However, if we try to react carboxylic acids with amines to give amides no substitution occurs:
an ammonium salt is formed because the amines themselves are basic and remove the acidic
proton from the acid.

Once the carboxylic acid is deprotonated, substitutions are prevented because (almost) no
nucleophile will attack the carboxylate anion. Under neutral conditions, alcohols are just not
reactive enough to add to the carboxylic acid but, with acid catalysis, esters can be formed
from alcohols and carboxylic acids.

###### Acid catalysts increase the reactivity of a carbonyl group

We saw in Chapter 6 that the lone pairs of a carbonyl group may be protonated by acid. Only
strong acids are powerful enough to protonate carbonyl groups: the pKa of protonated acetone
is –7 so, for example, even 1M HCl (pH 0) would protonate only 1 in 10[7] molecules of acetone.
However, even proportions as low as this are suffi cient to increase the rate of substitution
react ions at carbonyl groups enormously because those carbonyl groups that are protonated
become extremely powerful electrophiles.

It is for this reason that alcohols will react with carboxylic acids under acid catalysis. The
acid (usually HCl or H2SO4) reversibly protonates a small percentage of the carboxylic acid
molecules, and the protonated carboxylic acids are extremely susceptible to attack by even a
weak nucleophile such as an alcohol. This is the fi rst half of the reaction:

This tetrahedral intermediate is unstable because the energy to be gained by re-forming a
C=O bond is greater than that used in breaking two C–O bonds. As it stands, none of the
leaving groups (R[−], HO[−], or RO[−]) is very good. However, help is again at hand in the acid catalyst. It can protonate any of the oxygen atoms reversibly. Again, only a very small proportion
of molecules are protonated at any one time but, once the oxygen atom of, say, one of the OH
groups is protonated, it becomes a much better leaving group (water instead of HO[−]). Loss of
ROH from the tetrahedral intermediate is also possible: this leads back to starting materials—
hence the equilibrium arrow in the scheme above. Loss of H2O is more fruitful, and takes the
reaction forwards to the ester product.

###### Ester formation is reversible: how to control an equilibrium

Loss of water from the tetrahedral intermediate is reversible too: just as ROH will attack a protonated carboxylic acid, H2O will attack a protonated ester. In fact, every step in the sequence
from carboxylic acid to ester is an equilibrium, and the overall equilibrium constant is about 1.
In order for this reaction to be useful, it is therefore necessary to ensure that the equilibrium is
pushed towards the ester side by using an excess of alcohol or carboxylic acid (usually the reactions are done in a solution of the alcohol or the carboxylic acid). In this reaction, for example,
no water is added and an excess of alcohol is used. Using less than three equivalents of ethanol
gave lower yields of ester.

- **Making esters from alcohols**

**You have now met three ways of making esters from alcohols:**

**•** **with acyl chlorides**

**•** **with acid anhydrides**

**•** **with carboxylic acids.**

Try to appreciate that different methods will be appropriate at different times. If you want to make a few
milligrams of a complex ester, you are much more likely to work with a reactive acyl chloride or anhydride, using
pyridine as a weakly basic catalyst, than to try to distil out a minute quantity of water from a reaction mixture
containing a strong acid that may destroy the starting material. On the other hand, if you are a chemist making
simple esters (such as those in Chapter 2, p. 31) for the fl avouring industry on a scale of many tons, you might
prefer the cheaper option of carboxylic acid and a strong acid (e.g. H2SO4) in alcohol solution.


###### Acid-catalysed ester hydrolysis and transesterifi cation

By starting with an ester, an excess of water, and an acid catalyst we can persuade the reverse
reaction to occur: formation of the carboxylic acid plus alcohol with consumption of water.
Such a reaction is known as a hydrolysis reaction because water is used to break up the ester
into carboxylic acid plus alcohol (lysis=breaking).

Acid-catalysed ester formation and hydrolysis are the exact reverse of one another: the only
way we can control the reaction is by altering concentrations of reagents to drive the reaction
the way we want it to go. The same principles can be used to convert an ester of one alcohol
into an ester of another, a process known as transesterifi cation. It is possible, for example, to
force this equilibrium to the right by distilling methanol (which has a lower boiling point
than the other components of the reaction) out of the mixture.

###### Base-catalysed hydrolysis of esters is irreversible

You can’t make esters from carboxylic acids and alcohols under basic conditions because the
base deprotonates the carboxylic acid (see p. 207). However, you can reverse that reaction and
hydrolyse an ester to a carboxylic acid (more accurately, a carboxylate salt) and an alcohol.

This time the ester is, of course, not protonated fi rst as it would be in acid, but the unprotonated
ester is a good enough electrophile because OH[−], and not water, is the nucleophile. The tetrahedral
intermediate can collapse either way, giving back ester or going forward to acid plus alcohol.

The backward reaction is impossible because the basic conditions straightaway deprotonate
the acid to make a carboxylate salt (which, incidentally, consumes the base, making at least
one equivalent of base necessary in the reaction). Carboxylate salts do not usually react with
nucleophiles, even those a good deal stronger than alcohols.

###### How do we know this is the mechanism?

Ester hydrolysis is such an important reaction that chemists have spent a lot of time and effort fi nding out exactly how
it works. Many of the experiments that tell us about the mechanism involve oxygen-18 labelling. The starting material is
an ester enriched in the heavy oxygen isotope [18]O. By knowing where the heavy oxygen atoms start off, and following
(by mass spectrometry—Chapter 3) where they end up, the mechanism can be established.

1. An [18]O label in the ‘ether’ oxygen of the ester ends up in the alcohol product.

This mechanism
must be incorrect

One further labelling experiment showed that a tetrahedral intermediate must be formed: an ester labelled with [18]O in
its carbonyl oxygen atom passes some of its [18]O label to the water. We discussed this on p. 201.
There is more on the mechanism of ester hydrolysis in Chapter 12.

The saturated fatty acid tetradecanoic acid (also known as myristic acid) is manufactured
commercially from coconut oil by hydrolysis in base. You may be surprised to learn that
coconut oil contains more saturated fat than butter, lard, or beef dripping: much of it is the
trimyristate ester of glycerol. Hydrolysis with aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by
reprotonation of the sodium carboxylate salt with acid, gives myristic acid. Notice
how much longer it takes to hydrolyse this branched ester than it did to hydrolyse a methyl
ester (p. 210).

###### Amides can be hydrolysed under acidic or basic conditions too

In order to hydrolyse amides, the least reactive of the carboxylic acid derivatives, we have a
choice: we can persuade the amine leaving group to leave by protonating it, or we can use
brute force and forcibly eject it with concentrated hydroxide solution.
Amides are very unreactive as electrophiles, but they are also rather more basic than most
carboxylic acid derivatives: a typical protonated amide has a pKa of –1; most other carbonyl
compounds are much less basic. You might therefore imagine that the protonation of an
amide would take place on nitrogen—after all, amine nitrogen atoms are readily protonated.
And, indeed, the reason for the basicity of amides is the nitrogen atom’s delocalized lone pair,
making the carbonyl group unusually electron rich. But amides are always protonated on the
oxygen atom of the carbonyl group, never the nitrogen, because protonation at nitrogen
would disrupt the delocalized system that makes amides so stable. Protonation at oxygen
gives a delocalized cation (Chapter 8).

- Notice that this means that
one equivalent of acid is used
up in this reaction—the acid is
not solely a catalyst.


Protonation of the carbonyl group by acid makes the carbonyl group electrophilic enough
for attack by water, giving a neutral tetrahedral intermediate. The amine nitrogen atom in the
tetrahedral intermediate is much more basic than the oxygen atoms, so now it gets protonated, and the RNH2 group becomes really quite a good leaving group. Once it has left, it will
immediately be protonated again, and therefore become completely non-nucleophilic. The
conditions are very vigorous—70% sulfuric acid for 3 hours at 100 °C.

Hydrolysis of amides in base requires similarly vigorous conditions. Hot solutions of hydroxide are suffi ciently powerful nucleophiles to attack an amide carbonyl group, although even
when the tetrahedral intermediate has formed NH2− (pKa of the ammonium ion 35) has only a
slight chance of leaving when HO[−] (pKa of water 15) is an alternative. Nonetheless, at high
temperatures amides are slowly hydrolysed by concentrated base since one product is the
carboxylate salt and this does not react with nucleophiles. The ‘base’ for the irreversible step
might be hydroxide or NH2−.

Secondary and tertiary amides hydrolyse much more slowly under these conditions. With
all these amides a second mechanism kicks in if the hydroxide concentration is large enough.
More hydroxide deprotonates the tetrahedral anion to give a dianion that must lose NH2− as
the only alternative is O[2–]. This leaving group deprotonates water so the second molecule of
hydroxide ion is simply a catalyst.

A similar mechanism is successful with only a little water and plenty of strong base, Then
even tertiary amides can be hydrolysed at room temperature. Potassium _tert-butoxide is a_
strong enough base (pKa of t-BuOH about 18) to deprotonate the tetrahedral intermediate.



- You’ve not seen the option
of O[2−] as a leaving group before
but this is what you would need
if you want to break the bond to
O[−]. Asking O[2−] to be a leaving
group is like asking HO[−] to be
an acid.

###### Hydrolysing nitriles: how to make the almond extract, mandelic acid

###### Acid chlorides can be made from carboxylic acids using SOCl2 or PCl5

We have looked at a whole series of interconversions between carboxylic acid derivatives and,
after this next section, we shall summarize what you need to understand. We said that it is
always easy to move down the series of acid derivatives we listed early in the chapter, and so
far that is all we have done. But some reactions of carboxylic acids also enable us to move
upwards in the series. What we need is a reagent that changes the bad leaving group HO[−] into
a good leaving group. Strong acid does this by protonating the OH[−], allowing it to leave as
H2O. In this section we look at two more reagents, SOCl2 and PCl5, which convert the OH
group of a carboxylic acid and also turn it into a good leaving group. Thionyl chloride, SOCl2,
reacts with carboxylic acids to make acyl chlorides.

- Note that it is the more
nucleophilic carbonyl oxygen
which actually attacks S. If you
follow the fate of the two
oxygens right through the
mechanism you will see which
fact it is the oxygen that starts
off in the C=O group which is
replaced by Cl. You may also be
surprised to see the way we
substituted at S=O without
forming a ‘tetrahedral
intermediate’. Well, this trivalent
sulfur atom is already
tetrahedral (it still has one lone
pair), and substitution can go by
a direct substitution at sulfur.


Reprotonation of the unstable intermediate (by the HCl just produced, i.e. reversal of the last
step above) gives an electrophile powerful enough to react even with the weak nucleophile
Cl[−] (HCl is a strong acid, so Cl[−] is a poor nucleophile). The tetrahedral intermediate collapses to
the acyl chloride, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen chloride. This step is irreversible because SO2
and HCl are gases that are lost from the reaction mixture.


This volatile liquid with a choking smell is electrophilic at the sulfur atom (as you might
expect with two chlorine atoms and an oxygen atom attached) and is attacked by carboxylic
acids to give an unstable, and highly electrophilic, intermediate.

Although HCl is involved in this reaction, it cannot be used as the sole reagent for making

An alternative reagent for converting RCO2H into RCOCl is phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5.
The mechanism is similar—try writing it out before looking at the scheme below.

These conversions of acids into acid chlorides complete all the methods we need to convert
acids into any acid derivatives. You can convert acids directly to esters and now to acid chlorides, the most reactive of acid derivatives, and can make any other derivative from them. The
chart below adds reaction conditions, relevant pKas, and infrared stretching frequencies to

All these acid derivatives can, of course, be hydrolysed to the acid itself with water alone
or with various levels of acid or base catalysis depending on the reactivity of the derivative.

between infrared stretching
frequency and reactivity in
Chapter 18.


-----

- Five ‘oxidation levels’—(1)
hydrocarbon, (2) alcohol, (3)
aldehyde and ketone, (4)
carboxylic acid, and (5) CO2—
were defi ned in Chapter 2.


To climb the reactivity order therefore, the simplest method is to hydrolyse to the acid and
convert the acid into the acid chloride. You are now at the top of the reactivity order and can
go down to whatever level you require.

###### Making other compounds by substitution reactions of acid derivatives

We’ve talked at length about the interconversions of acid derivatives, explaining the mechanism of attack of nucleophiles such as ROH, H2O, and NH3 on acyl chlorides, acid anhydrides,
esters, acids, and amines, with or without acid or base present. We shall now go on to talk
about substitution reactions of acid derivatives that take us out of this closed company of
compounds and allow us to make compounds containing functional groups at other oxidation levels, such as ketones and alcohols.

###### Making ketones from esters: the problem

Substitution of the OR group of an ester by an R group would give us a ketone. You might
therefore think that reaction of an ester with an organolithium or Grignard reagent would be
a good way of making ketones. However, if we try the reaction, something else happens, as
you saw at the start of this chapter.

Two molecules of Grignard have been incorporated and we get an alcohol! If we look at the
mechanism we can understand why this should be so. First, as you would expect, the nucleophilic Grignard reagent attacks the carbonyl group to give a tetrahedral intermediate. The
only reasonable leaving group is RO[−], so it leaves to give us the ketone we set out to make.

**O** **O** **O**

Now, the next molecule of Grignard reagent has a choice. It can react with either the ester
starting material or the newly formed ketone. Ketones are more electrophilic than esters so
the Grignard reagent prefers to react with the ketone in the manner you saw in Chapter 9. A
stable alkoxide anion is formed, which gives the tertiary alcohol on acid work-up.

In other words, the problem here lies in the fact that the ketone product is more reactive than
the ester starting material. We shall meet more examples of this general problem later
(in Chapter 23, for example): in the next section we shall look at ways of overcoming it.
Meanwhile, why not see it as a useful reaction? This compound, for example, was needed by
some chemists in the course of research into explosives.
It is a tertiary alcohol with the hydroxyl group fl anked by two identical R (= butyl) groups.
The chemists who wanted to make the compound knew that an ester would react twice with
the same organolithium reagent, so they made it from this unsaturated ester (known as
methyl methacrylate) and butyllithium.

This reaction works in reduction too if we use lithium aluminium hydride, LiAlH4. This is a
powerful reducing agent that readily attacks the carbonyl group of an ester. Again, collapse of
the tetrahedral intermediate gives a compound, this time an aldehyde, which is more reactive
than the ester starting material, so a second reaction takes place and the ester is converted
(reduced) into an alcohol. Sodium borohydride, often used for the reduction of ketones, does
not usually reduce esters.

This is an extremely important reaction, and one of the best ways of making alcohols from
esters. Stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage is more diffi cult: we shall discuss this in
Chapter 23.

###### A bit of shorthand

Before we go any further, we should introduce to you a little bit of chemical shorthand that
makes writing many mechanisms easier. As you now appreciate, all substitution reactions at
a carbonyl group go via a tetrahedral intermediate.

A convenient way to save writing a step is to show the formation and collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate in the same structure, by using a double-headed arrow, as in the diagrams
below. Now, this is a useful shorthand, but it is not a substitute for understanding the true
mechanism. Certainly, you must never ever write the reaction as a single step not involving
the carbonyl group.

###### Making ketones from esters: the solution

We diagnosed the problem with our intended reaction as one of reactivity: the product
ketone is more reactive than the starting ester. To get round this problem we need to do one
of two things:

**1.** make the starting material more reactive or

**2.** make the product less reactive.

###### Making the starting materials more reactive

A more reactive starting material would be an acyl chloride: how about reacting one
of these with a Grignard reagent? This approach can work—for example this reaction is
successful.

Often, better results are obtained by transmetallating (see Chapter 9) the Grignard reagent,
or the organolithium, with copper salts. Organocopper reagents are too unreactive to add to
the product ketones, but they react well with the acyl chloride. Consider this reaction, for
example: the product was needed for a synthesis of the antibiotic septamycin.

###### Making the products less reactive

This alternative solution is often better. With the right starting material, the tetrahedral intermediate can become stable enough not to collapse to a ketone during the reaction; it therefore
remains completely unreactive towards nucleophiles. The ketone is formed only when the
reaction is fi nally quenched with acid but the nucleophile is also destroyed by the acid and
none is left for further addition.

We can illustrate this concept with a reaction of an unlikely looking electrophile, a lithium
carboxylate. Towards the beginning of the chapter we said that carboxylic acids were bad
electrophiles and that carboxylate salts were even worse. Well, that is true, but with a suffi ciently powerful nucleophile (an organolithium) it is just possible to get addition to the carbonyl group of a lithium carboxylate.

We could say that the affi nity of lithium for oxygen means that the Li–O bond has considerable covalent character, making the CO2Li less of a true anion. And the intermediate after
addition of MeLi is probably best represented as a covalent compound too. Anyway, the


-----

product of this addition is a dianion of the sort that we met during one of the mechanisms of
base-catalysed amide hydrolysis. But in this case there is no possible leaving group, so there
the dianion sits. Only at the end of the reaction, when water is added, are the oxygen atoms
protonated to give a hydrated ketone, which collapses immediately (remember Chapter 6)
to give the ketone that we wanted. The water quench also destroys any remaining organolithium, so the ketone is safe from further attack.

of organolithium are needed in
this reaction: one to
deprotonate the acid, one to
deprotonate the hydroxyl group,
and one to react with the

Another good set of starting materials that lead to non-collapsible tetrahedral intermediates
is known as the Weinreb amides, after their inventor, S. M. Weinreb. Addition of organolithium or organomagnesium reagents to N-methoxy-N-methyl amides gives the tetrahedral
intermediate shown, stabilized by chelation of the magnesium atom by the two oxygen atoms.
Chelation means the coordination of more than one electron-donating atom in a molecule to
a single metal atom.

This strategy even works for making aldehydes, if the starting material is dimethylformamide (DMF, Me2NCHO). This is an extremely useful way of adding electrophilic CHO
groups to organometallic nucleophiles. Once again, the tetrahedral intermediate is stable
until acid is added at the end of the reaction and the protonated tetrahedral intermediate
collapses.

A fi nal alternative is to use a nitrile instead of an ester. The intermediate is the anion of an
imine (see Chapter 12 for more about imines), which is not electrophilic at all—in fact, it’s
quite nucleophilic, but there are no electrophiles for it to react with until the reaction is
quenched with acid. It gets protonated and hydrolyses (we’ll discuss this in the next chapter)
to the ketone.

###### And to conclude. . .

In this chapter you have been introduced to some important reactions—you can consider
them to be a series of facts if you wish, but it is better to see them as the logical outcome of a
few simple mechanistic steps. Relate what you have seen to what you gathered from Chapters
6 and 9, when we fi rst started looking at carbonyl groups. All we did in this chapter was to
build some subsequent transformations on to the simplest organic reaction, addition to a
carbonyl group. You should have noticed that the reactions of all acid derivatives are related
and are very easily explained by writing out proper mechanisms, taking into account the presence of acid or base. In the next two chapters we shall see more of these acid- and basecatalysed reactions of carbonyl groups. Try to view them as closely related to the ones in this
chapter—the same principles apply to their mechanisms.

In Chapter 10 you saw that these compounds are not always stable: if the starting material
contains a leaving group, the addition product is a tetrahedral intermediate, which collapses
with loss of the leaving group to give back the carbonyl group, with overall substitution of the
leaving group by the nucleophile.

- Acetals had walk-on parts in
Chapters 2 and 6; in this
chapter they are one of the
stars. They are simply
compounds with two oxygen
atoms bound to the same
saturated carbon atom. This
example is cyclic, but others are
not, for example CH2(OMe)2.


In this chapter you will meet substitution reactions of a different type. Instead of losing a
leaving group, the carbonyl group loses its oxygen atom. Here are two important examples:
the carbonyl oxygen atom has been replaced by a nitrogen atom during imine formation and
by two atoms of oxygen during acetal formation. Notice too the acid catalyst—we shall see
shortly why it is required. These are examples of nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group
_with loss of carbonyl oxygen._

You have, in fact, already met some less important reactions in which the carbonyl oxygen
atom can be lost, but you probably didn’t notice at the time. The equilibrium between an
aldehyde or ketone and its hydrate (p. 134) is one such reaction.
When the hydrate reverts to starting materials, either of its two oxygen atoms must leave: one
came from the water and one from the carbonyl group, so 50% of the time the oxygen atom that
belonged to the carbonyl group will be lost. Usually, this is of no consequence, but it can be useful. For example, in 1968 some chemists studying the reactions that take place inside mass
spectrometers needed to label the carbonyl oxygen atom of a ketone with the isotope [18]O.

By stirring the ‘normal’ [16]O compound with a large excess of isotopically labelled water
for a few hours in the presence of a drop of acid they were able to make the required labelled
compound. Without the acid catalyst, the exchange is very slow. Acid catalysis speeds the
reaction up by making the carbonyl group more electrophilic so that equilibrium is reached
more quickly.

###### Aldehydes can react with alcohols to form hemiacetals

When acetaldehyde is dissolved in methanol, a reaction takes place: we know this because the
IR spectrum of the mixture shows that a new compound has been formed. Most dramatically,
the carbonyl frequency is no longer there. However, isolating the product is impossible: it
decomposes back to acetaldehyde and methanol.

The product is in fact a hemiacetal. Like hydrates, most hemiacetals are unstable with
respect to their parent aldehydes and alcohols, for example the equilibrium constant for reaction of acetaldehyde with simple alcohols is about 0.5.

So by making [MeOH] very large (using it as the solvent, for example) we can turn most of
the aldehyde into the hemiacetal. However, if we try to purify the hemiacetal by removing the
methanol, more hemiacetal keeps decomposing to maintain the equilibrium constant. That
is why we can never isolate such hemiacetals in a pure form.

###### Acid or base catalysts increase the rate of equilibration of hemiacetals with their aldehyde and alcohol parents

Acyclic hemiacetals form relatively slowly from an aldehyde or ketone plus an alcohol, but
their rate of formation is greatly increased either by acid or by base. As you would expect from
Chapters 6 and 10, acid catalysts work by increasing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group.



- The exceptions are cyclic
hemiacetals, as you saw in
Chapter 6, in which the
nucleophilic OH group is in the
same molecule as the
electrophilic carbonyl. We will
explain how entropy accounts
for this in Chapter 12.

Base catalysts, on the other hand, work by increasing the nucleophilicity of the alcohol
by removing the OH proton before it attacks the C�O group. In both cases the energy of
the starting materials is raised: in the acid-catalysed reaction the aldehyde is destabilized by protonation and in the base-catalysed reaction the alcohol is destabilized by
deprotonation.

You can see why hemiacetals are unstable: they are essentially tetrahedral intermediates
containing a leaving group and, just as acid or base catalyses the formation of hemiacetals,
acid or base also catalyses their decomposition back to starting aldehyde or ketone and alcohol. That’s why the title of this section indicated that acid or base catalysts increase the rate of
equilibration of hemiacetals with their aldehyde and alcohol components—catalysts never
change the position of that equilibrium!

###### Acetals are formed from aldehydes or ketones plus alcohols in the presence of acid

We said that a solution of acetaldehyde in methanol contains a new compound: a hemiacetal.
We’ve also said that the rate of formation of hemiacetals is increased by adding an acid (or a
base) catalyst to the alcohol plus aldehyde mixture. But, if we add catalytic acid to our acetaldehyde–methanol mixture, we fi nd not only that the rate of reaction of the acetaldehyde with
the methanol increases, but also that a different product is formed. This product is an acetal;
the hemiacetal is half-way there.

In the presence of acid (but not base!) hemiacetals can undergo an elimination reaction
(different from the one that just gives back aldehyde plus alcohol), losing the oxygen atom
that once belonged to the parent aldehyde’s carbonyl group.

The stages are:

**1.** Protonation of the hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal.

**2.** Loss of water by elimination. This elimination leads to an unstable and highly
reactive oxonium ion.

**3.** Addition of methanol to the oxonium ion (breaking the π bond and not the σ bond,
of course).

**4.** Loss of a proton to give the acetal.

###### Oxonium ions

Oxonium ions have three bonds to a positively charged oxygen atom. All three bonds can be σ bonds, as in H3O[+] or
Meerwein’s salt, trimethyloxonium fl uoroborate, a stable (though reactive) alkylating agent, or one bond can be a π bond
as in the acetal intermediate. The term ‘oxonium ion’ describes either of these structures. They are like alkylated ethers
or O-alkylated carbonyl compounds.

Just as protonated carbonyl groups are much more electrophilic than unprotonated ones,
these oxonium ions are powerful electrophiles. They can react rapidly with a second molecule
of alcohol to form the new, stable compounds known as acetals. An oxonium ion was also an
intermediate in the formation of hemiacetals in acid solution. Before reading any further, it
would be worthwhile to write out the whole mechanism of acetal formation from aldehyde or
ketone plus alcohol through the hemiacetal to the acetal, preferably without looking at the
fragments of mechanism above or the answer overleaf.

 - **Formation of acetals and hemiacetals**

**Hemiacetal formation is catalysed by acid or base, but acetal formation is possible only with an**
**acid catalyst because an OH group must be made into a good leaving group.**

The mechanism is the most complex you have met and it will help you to recall it if you see
it in two halves, each very similar to the other. The reaction starts with a protonation on carbonyl oxygen and addition of an alcohol to the C�O π bond. When you get to the temporary
haven of the hemiacetal, you start again with protonation of that same oxygen then lose the
OH group by breaking what was the C�O σ bond to form an oxonium ion. Each half goes
through an oxonium ion and the alcohol adds to each oxonium ion. The last step in the formation of both the acetal and the hemiacetal is the loss of a proton from the recently added
alcohol. From your complete mechanism you should also be able to verify that acetal formation is indeed catalytic in acid.

acid-catalysed acetal hydrolysis


Just as with the ester formation and hydrolysis reactions we discussed in Chapter 10, every step
in the formation of an acetal is reversible. To make acetals, therefore, we must use an excess of
alcohol or remove the water from the reaction mixture as it forms, by distillation for example.

In fact, acetal formation is even more diffi cult than ester formation: while the equilibrium
constant for acid-catalysed formation of ester from carboxylic acid plus alcohol is usually
about 1, for acetal formation from an aldehyde and ethanol (shown above), the equilibrium
constant is K = 0.0125. For ketones, the value is even lower: in fact, it is often very diffi cult to
make the acetals of ketones (sometimes called ketals) unless they are cyclic (we consider cyclic
acetals later in the chapter). However, there are several techniques that can be used to prevent
the water produced in the reaction from hydrolysing the product.

With the more reactive aldehyde, it was suffi cient just to have an excess of one of the reagents (acetaldehyde) to drive the reaction to completion. Dry HCl gas can work too. With a less

###### Acetals hydrolyse only in the presence of acid

Just as acetal formation requires acid catalysis, acetals can be hydrolysed only by using an acid
catalyst. With aqueous acid, the hydrolysis of acyclic acetals is very easy. Our examples are the
two acetals we made earlier.

- **Acetal hydrolysis**

**Acetals can be hydrolysed in acid but are stable to base.**


We won’t go through the mechanism again—you’ve already seen it as the reverse of acetal
formation, but the fact that acetals are stable to base is really a very important point, which
we will use on the next page and capitalize on further in Chapter 23.

###### Cyclic acetals are more stable than acyclic acetals

Of course you want us to prove it. Well, in this example the starting material has three acetals:
an ordinary acetal formed from methanol (in black), a fi ve-membered cyclic acetal, and a
dithioacetal. Only the black acetal hydrolyses under these mild conditions.

The acetals you have met so far were formed by reaction of two molecules of alcohol with
one of carbonyl compound. Cyclic acetals, formed by reaction of a single molecule of a diol,
a compound containing two hydroxyl groups, are also important. When the diol is ethylene
glycol (as in this example) the fi ve-membered cyclic acetal is known as a dioxolane.

- Cyclic acetals like this are
more resistant to hydrolysis than
acyclic ones, and easier to
make—they form quite readily
even from ketones. One
explanation for this is that
whenever the second oxonium
ion in this mechanism forms, the
hydroxyl group is always held
close by, ready to snap shut and
give back the dioxolane; water
gets less of a chance to attack it
and hydrolyse the acetal. We
will discuss in entropic terms
why cyclic acetals and
hemiacetals are more stable in
Chapter 12.


oxonium ion the dioxolane

Water is still generated, and needs to be got rid of: in the example above you can see that
water was distilled out of the reaction mixture. This is possible with these diols because they
have a boiling point above that of water (the boiling point of ethylene glycol is 197 °C). You
can’t distil water from a reaction mixture containing methanol or ethanol because the alcohols
distil too! One very useful piece of equipment for removing water from reaction mixtures containing only reagents that boil at higher temperatures than water is called a Dean Stark head.


###### Modifying reactivity using acetals

Why are acetals so important? Well, they’re important to both nature and chemists because
many carbohydrates are acetals or hemiacetals (see the box below). One important use that
chemists have put them to is as protecting groups. One synthesis of the steroid class of compounds (about which more later) requires a Grignard reagent with an impossible structure.
This compound cannot exist as the Grignard functional group would attack the ketone: it
would react with itself. Instead, the protected Grignard reagent is used, made from the same
bromoketone, but with an acetal-forming step.


###### Dean Stark head

When a mixture of toluene and water boils, the vapour produced is a constant ratio mixture of toluene vapour and water
vapour known as an azeotrope. If this mixture is condensed, the liquid toluene and water, being immiscible, separate
out into two layers with the water below. By using a Dean Stark apparatus, or Dean Stark head, the toluene layer can
be returned to the reaction mixture while the water is removed. Reactions requiring removal of water by distillation are
therefore often carried out in refl uxing toluene or benzene under a Dean Stark head.

ketone protected as acetal stable Grignard reagent


Acetals, as we stressed, are stable to base and to basic nucleophiles such as Grignard reagents, so we no longer have a reactivity problem. Once the Grignard reagent has reacted with
an electrophile, the ketone can be recovered by hydrolysing the acetal in dilute acid. The
acetal is functioning here as a protecting group because it protects the ketone from attack by
the Grignard reagent. Protecting groups are extremely important in organic synthesis and we
will return to them in Chapter 23.

###### Amines react with carbonyl compounds

The ketone carbonyl group of pyruvic acid (or 2-oxopropanoic acid) has a stretching frequency of a typical ketone, 1710 cm[−][1]. When hydroxylamine is added to a solution of pyruvic
acid, this stretching frequency slowly disappears. Later, a new IR absorption appears at
1400 cm[−][1]. What happens?

You can probably apply something of what you know from Chapters 6 and 10 about the
reactivity of carbonyl compounds towards nucleophiles to work out what is happening in this
reaction between a carbonyl compound and an amine. The hydroxylamine fi rst adds to the
ketone to form an unstable intermediate similar to a hemiacetal.

Notice that it is the more nucleophilic nitrogen atom, and not the oxygen atom, of hydroxylamine that adds to the carbonyl group. Like hemiacetals, these intermediates are unstable and
can decompose by loss of water. The product is known as an oxime and it is this compound,
with its C�N double bond, that is responsible for the IR absorption at 1400 cm[−][1].

that the intermediate has no double bond to give an IR absorbance in this region of the spectrum.

###### Imines are the nitrogen analogues of carbonyl compounds

In fact, the oxime formed from a ketone and hydroxylamine is just a special example of
an imine. All imines have a C�N double bond and are formed when any primary amine
reacts with an aldehyde or a ketone under appropriate conditions, for example aniline
and benzaldehyde.

You shouldn’t need us to tell you the mechanism of this reaction: even without looking at
the mechanism we gave for the formation of the oxime it should come as no surprise to you
by now. But as the reaction is very important in chemistry and biology, we’ll discuss it in some
depth. First, the amine attacks the aldehyde and the intermediate known as a hemiacetal is
formed. Amines are good nucleophiles for carbonyl groups, and aldehydes and ketones are
electrophilic. There is no need for any catalysis in this step. Indeed, addition of acid would
slow the reaction down as the nucleophilic amine would be removed as a salt.

First step in imine formation:
the amine attacks the carbonyl group to form the hemiaminal intermediate:

Dehydration of the hemiaminal gives the imine. Now there is some need for catalysis: acid
must be added so that the OH group can become a good leaving group. This step resembles the
conversion of hemiacetals to acetals. The difference is that the iminium ion can lose a proton
and become a neutral imine.

- **Imine formation requires acid catalysis.**


So acid is needed for the second step but hinders the fi rst step. Clearly some compromise is
needed. Without an acid catalyst, the reaction is very slow, although in some cases it may still
take place. Imine formation is in fact fastest at about pH 4–6: at lower pH, too much amine is
protonated and the rate of the fi rst step is slow; above this pH the proton concentration is too
low to allow protonation of the OH leaving group in the dehydration step. Imine formation is
like a biological reaction: it is fastest near neutrality.

###### Imines are usually unstable and are easily hydrolysed

Imines are formed from aldehydes or ketones with most primary amines. In general, they are
stable enough to be isolated only if either the C or N of the imine double bond bears an aromatic substituent. Imines formed from ammonia are unstable, but can be detected in solution.
CH2�NH, for example, decomposes at temperatures above –80 °C, but PhCH�NH is detectable
by UV spectroscopy in a mixture of benzaldehyde and ammonia in methanol.

Imines are readily hydrolysed to the carbonyl compound and amine by aqueous acid—in
fact, except for the particularly stable special cases we discuss below, most can be hydrolysed
by water without acid or base catalysis. You have, in fact, already met an imine hydrolysis: at
the end of Chapter 10 we talked about the addition of Grignard reagents to nitriles. The product is an imine that hydrolyses in acid solution to ketone plus ammonia.



- Because it is made from an
unsymmetrical ketone this imine
can exist as a mixture of E and Z
isomers, just like an alkene.
When it is formed by this
method the ratio obtained is 8:1
E:Z. Unlike the geometrical
isomers of alkenes, however,
those of an imine usually
interconvert quite rapidly at
room temperature. The
geometrical isomers of oximes
on the other hand are stable
and can even be separated.

The mechanism of the hydrolysis is the reverse of imine formation, going through the
same hemiaminal intermediate and the same iminium and oxonium ions. All these steps are
reversible and this should remind you that the relative stability of the starting material and
product is as important in imine formation and hydrolysis as it is in acetal formation and
hydrolysis.

LUMO, making it less susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Oximes, hydrazones, and semicarbazones require acid or base catalysis to be hydrolysed.

###### Iminium ions and oxonium ions

Let’s return to the mechanism of imine formation, and compare it for a moment with that of
acetal formation. The only difference to begin with is that there is no need for acid catalysis
for the addition of the amine but there is need for acid catalysis in the addition of the alcohol,
a much weaker nucleophile.

Up to this point, the two mechanisms follow a very similar path, with clear analogy between
the hemiaminal and hemiacetal intermediates, and between the iminium and oxonium ions.
Here, though, they diverge, because the iminium ion carries a proton, which the oxonium ion
doesn’t have. The iminium ion therefore acts as an acid, losing a proton to become the imine.
The oxonium ion, on the other hand, acts as an electrophile, adding another molecule of
alcohol to become the acetal.

As you might guess, however, iminium ions can be persuaded to act as electrophiles, just like
oxonium ions, provided a suitable nucleophile is present. We will spend the next few pages
considering reactions in which an iminium ion acts as an electrophile. First, though, we will
look at a reaction in which the iminium ion cannot lose an N–H proton because it has none.

###### Secondary amines react with carbonyl compounds to form enamines

Pyrrolidine, a secondary amine, reacts with isobutyraldehyde, under the sort of conditions
you would use to make an imine, to give an enamine. The name enamine combines ‘ene’
(C�C double bond) and ‘amine’.

The mechanism consists of the same steps as those that take place when imines form from
primary amines, up to formation of the iminium ion. This iminium ion has no N–H proton
to lose, so it loses one of the C–H protons next to the C�N to give the enamine. Enamines,
like imines, are unstable to aqueous acid.

###### Iminium ions can react as electrophilic intermediates

We made the point above that the difference in reactivity between an iminium ion and
an oxonium ion is that an iminium ion can lose H[+] and form an imine or an enamine, while
an oxonium ion reacts as an electrophile. Iminium ions can, however, react as electrophiles
provided suitable nucleophiles are present. In fact, they are very good electrophiles, and
are signifi cantly more reactive than carbonyl compounds. For example, iminium ions
are reduced rapidly by the mild reducing agent sodium cyanoborohydride, Na(CN)BH3,
while carbonyl compounds are not. An alternative to Na(CN)BH3 is NaBH(OAc)3 (sodium
triacetoxyborohydride)—somewhat safer because strong acid can release deadly HCN from
Na(CN)BH3.

###### Amines from imines: reductive amination

A useful way of making amines is by reduction of imines (or iminium ions). This overall process, from carbonyl compound to amine, is called reductive amination. This is, in fact, one
of the few successful ways, and the best way, of making secondary amines. This should be
your fi rst choice in amine synthesis.

This can be done in two steps, provided the intermediate is stable, but, because the instability of many imines makes them hard to isolate, the most convenient way of doing it is to form
and reduce the imine in a single reaction. The selective reduction of iminium ions (but not
carbonyl compounds) by sodium cyanoborohydride makes this possible. When Na(CN)BH3 is
added to a typical imine-formation reaction it reacts with the iminium ion but not with the
starting carbonyl compound nor with the imine. Here is an example of an amine synthesis
using reductive amination.

In the fi rst step, the ketone and ammonia are in equilibrium with their imine, which, at
pH 6, is partly protonated as an iminium ion. The iminium ion is rapidly reduced by the
cyanoborohydride to give the amine. Reactions like this, using ammonia in a reductive
amination, are often carried out with ammonium chloride or acetate as convenient sources
of ammonia. At pH 6, ammonia will be mostly protonated anyway as the pKa of NH4+ is
about 10.

In the second step of the synthesis, amine plus formaldehyde gives an imine, present as its

again with the secondary amine to give an iminium ion; this too is reduced to the amine.

Living things use a very similar reaction to manufacture amino acids from keto acids, but do it much more effi ciently. The

This imine (biochemists call imines Schiff bases) is in equilibrium with an isomeric imine, which can be hydrolysed to pyridoxal and alanine. These reactions are, of course, all controlled by enzymes and coupled to the degradation of unwanted
amino acids (the latter process converts the pyridoxal back to pyridoxamine). Nature was doing reductive aminations a
long time before sodium cyanoborohydride was invented! We will come back to this in Chapter 42.

An alternative method for reductive amination uses hydrogenation (hydrogen gas with a
metal catalyst) to reduce the imine in the presence of the carbonyl compound. Most of these
reductions do not require such high temperatures or pressures.



- Hydrogenation is a good way
of reducing a number of
different functional groups, but
not (usually) carbonyl groups. In
Chapter 23 we will look in more
detail at reducing agents (and
other types of reagent) that

functional group over another
(chemoselectivity).

###### Lithium aluminium hydride reduces amides to amines

We’ve talked about reduction of iminium ions formed from carbonyl compounds plus amines.
Iminium ions can also be formed by reducing amides with lithium aluminium hydride. A
tetrahedral intermediate is formed that collapses to the iminium ion.

The iminium ion is, of course, more electrophilic than the starting amides (amide carbonyl
groups are about the least electrophilic of any!), so it gets reduced to the secondary amine.
This reaction can be used to make secondary amines from primary amines and acyl chlorides.
A similar reduction with lithium aluminium hydride gives a primary amine from a nitrile.

###### Cyanide will attack iminium ions: the Strecker synthesis of amino acids

Cyanide will react with iminium ions to form α amino nitriles. Although these compounds are
relatively unimportant in their own right, a simple hydrolysis step produces α amino acids.
This route to amino acids is known as the Strecker synthesis. Of course, it’s not usually necessary to make the amino acids that Nature produces for us in living systems: they can be
extracted from hydrolysed proteins. This Strecker synthesis is of phenylglycine, an amino acid
not found in proteins. Cyanide reacts more rapidly with the iminium ion generated in the fi rst
step than it does with the starting benzaldehyde.

of the nitrile to the carboxylic
acid! (If you need reminding it is

###### Substitution of C��O for C�C: a brief look at the Wittig reaction

Before we leave substitution reactions of carbonyl groups, there is one more reaction that we
must introduce. It is an important one and we will come back to it again later in this book,
particularly in Chapter 27. It also has a rather different mechanism from most you have met
in recent chapters, but we talk about it here because the overall consequence of the Wittig
**reaction is the substitution of a C�C bond for a C�O bond.**
We don’t normally tell you the name of a reaction before even mentioning how to do it, but
here we make an exception because the reagents are rather unusual and need explaining in
detail. The Wittig reaction is a reaction between a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone
only) and a species known as a phosphonium ylid. An ylid (or ylide) is a species with positive
and negative charges on adjacent atoms, and phosphonium ylids are made from phospho**nium salts by deprotonating them with a strong base.**
You have already met phosphonium salts in Chapter 5, where you saw the reaction of a
phosphine (triphenylphosphine) with an alkyl halide (methyl iodide) to give the tetrahedral
phosphonium salt.

The chemistry of some elements is dominated by one particular property, and a theme running right through the chemistry of phosphorus is its exceptional affi nity for oxygen. The
P�O bond, with its bond energy of 575 kJ mol[−][1], is one of the strongest double bonds in chemistry, and the Wittig reaction is irreversible and is driven forward by the formation of this
P�O bond. No need here for the careful control of an equilibrium necessary when making
acetals or imines.

###### Summary

In this chapter, as in Chapter 10, you have met a wide variety of reactions, but we hope you
have again been able to see that they are all related mechanistically. Of course, we have not
been exhaustive: it would be impossible to cover every possible reaction of a carbonyl group,
but having read Chapters 6, 9, and 10 you should feel confi dent in writing a reasonable mecha_nism for any reaction involving nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group. You could try think-_
ing about this, for example.

‘One could no longer just mix
things; sophistication in physical
chemistry was the base from
which all chemists—including
the organic—must start.’
Christopher Ingold (1893–
1970). Ingold uncovered many
of the mechanisms we now take
for granted in organic chemistry.

If you go into a chemistry laboratory, you will see some reactions being heated in boiling solvent
(perhaps 80 to 120 °C), and you will see others being performed at maybe –80 °C or below. Some
reactions are over in a few minutes; others are left for hours. In some reactions the amounts of
reagents are critical; in others large excesses are used. Some reactions use water as a solvent; in
others it must be rigorously excluded, and perhaps toluene, ether, ethanol, or DMF is essential
for the success of the reaction. Why such a diverse range of conditions? How can conditions be
chosen to favour the reaction we want? To explain all this we will need to work through some
thermodynamic principles. We will take a practical, visual approach to the topic, and we will
avoid detailed algebraic discussion: for that you are welcome to turn to a textbook of physical
chemistry—there are some suggestions at the end of this chapter. In fact, we will use only two
algebraic equations. Both are so important that you should memorize them; the second in particular can be extremely valuable when we think about how to get reactions to work.

###### How far and how fast?

In previous chapters we have said things about the reversibility of reactions:

‘Cyanohydrin formation is reversible: just dissolving a cyanohydrin in water can give
back the aldehyde or ketone you started with’ (Chapter 6); ‘HCl transfers its proton
almost completely to water, and is a strong acid. But the transfer of protons to water
from carboxylic acids is only partial’ (Chapter 8); ‘This step is irreversible because SO2
and HCl are gases that are lost from the reaction mixture’ (Chapter 10); ‘The tetrahedral intermediate can collapse either way, giving back ester or going forward to acid
plus alcohol.’ (Chapter 10);

about the relative stability of different compounds:

‘The most important factor in the strength of an acid is the stability of the conjugate
base’ (Chapter 8); ‘F[−] is much more stable than CH3− because fl uorine is much more
electronegative than carbon’ (Chapter 8); ‘Oximes are more stable than imines because
the electronegative substituent can participate in delocalization of the imine double
bond’ (Chapter 11);


and about the rate of reactions:

‘Benzaldehyde is reduced about 400 times faster than acetophenone in isopropanol’
(Chapter 6); ‘While amines react with acetic anhydride quite rapidly at room temperature (reaction complete in a few hours), alcohols react extremely slowly in the absence
of a base’ (Chapter 10); ‘Secondary and tertiary amides are diffi cult to hydrolyse but a
similar mechanism is successful with only a little water and plenty of a strong
base’ (Chapter 10); ‘Acyclic hemiacetals form relatively slowly from an aldehyde or
ketone plus an alcohol, but their rate of formation is greatly increased either by acid or
by base’ (Chapter 11).


We are now going to consider in detail why some reactions can run forwards or backwards, why some form products irreversibly, why some reach an equilibrium, why some
reactions go fast and some go slow, and what stability has to do with all of this.
Understanding these factors will allow you to make the reactions you want to happen go
faster and the reactions you don’t want to happen go slower, giving you a product in a useful yield. We shall be breaking reaction mechanisms down into steps and working out
which step is the most important. But fi rst we must consider what we really mean by the
‘stability’ of molecules and what determines how much of one substance you get when it is
in equilibrium with another.

###### Stability and energy levels


So far we have been rather vague about the term ‘stability’, just
saying things like ‘this compound is more stable than that com- energy of

_cis-butene_

pound’. What we really mean is that this compound has less energy which would

be released on

**energy than that one. For example, as you know from Chapters** (ca. 2 kJ mol[–1]) converting cis to trans
4 and 7 alkenes can come in two forms we can call cis and trans.
In general trans-alkenes are more stable than cis-alkenes. How energy of energy released
do we know? Well, we can convert both cis- and trans-butene to _trans-butene_ on adding H2 to

_cis-butene_

the same alkane, butane, by adding a molecule of hydrogen. energy released
Energy is given out during the reaction, and if we measure how on adding H2 to

_trans-butene_

much energy we get from hydrogenation of trans-butene and
compare it with the amount we get from _cis-butene, we fi nd_
that the cis-alkene give us about 2 kJ mol[−][1] more. Cis-butene is

energy of butane

higher in energy, and must therefore be less stable. We can represent this in the energy profi le diagram on the right. The two red lines show the energies of

example, as you saw in Chapter 7, rotation about the C–N bond of an amide is slow because
delocalization of the N lone pair gives it some double-bond character.
The C–N bond can rotate, but the rotation is slow and can be measured by NMR spec- **O** **O**

the two R groups _trans to one another, and one with them_ _cis. Depending on the size_ **Me** **NH2** **Me** **NH2**

- Cis- and trans-alkenes don’t

about this on p. 105.


This time there is an axis along the bottom indicating the extent of rotation about the
C–N bond. The two red lines show the energies of the molecules and the curved black line
shows what must happen in energy terms as the two forms interconvert. Energy goes up
as the C–N bond starts to rotate and reaches a maximum at point X when rotation by 90°
has removed the conjugation (the nitrogen lone pair can’t delocalize into the C=O bond
because it is perpendicular to the C=O π* orbital) before falling again as the conjugation
is regained.
The relative energies of the two states will depend on the nature of R. The situation we have
shown, with the cis arrangement being much less stable than the trans, would apply to large R
groups. We can defi ne an equilibrium constant K for this process. For large R groups, K will be
very large:

_trans]_
_K_ = [[amide with R groups ]

[amide with R groups cis]


At the other extreme is the case when both substituents on nitrogen are H. Then the two
arrangements would have equal energies. The process which interconverts the structures is
the same but there is now no difference between them. If you could measure an equilibrium
constant, it would now be exactly K = 1.

In more general terms, amide rotation is a simple example of an equilibrium reaction. If we
replace ‘amount of C–N bond rotation’ with ‘reaction coordinate’ we have a picture of a typical reaction in which reagents and products are in equilibrium.

###### How the equilibrium constant varies with the difference in energy between reactants and products



- The reaction coordinate is
simply an arbitrary measure of
the progress of a molecule of
starting material as it turns into
a molecule of product. You will
see it in several diagrams in this
chapter.


You saw that when the energies of the two forms of the amide were the same, the equilibrium
constant for their interconversion must be K = 1. When one was higher in energy than the
other, we just said that K was ‘large’. But we can be more specifi c. For any reaction in equilibrium, the equilibrium constant K is related to the difference in energy between the starting
materials and the products by the following equation:

ΔG = –RTlnK


where ΔG (the free energy of the reaction) is the difference in energy between the two states
(in kJ mol[−][1]), T is the temperature (in kelvin, not °C), and R is a constant known as the gas
**constant and equal to 8.314 J K[−][1] mol[−][1].**
This equation tells us that we can work out the equilibrium composition (how much of
each component there is at equilibrium) provided we know the difference in energy between
the products and reactants.

###### An example: hydration of an aldehyde


This relationship was derived by
the American physical chemist
J. Willard Gibbs in the 1870s.


In Chapter 6 we showed you that water adds reversibly to the carbonyl group of an aldehyde:
the aldehyde and the hydrate are in equilibrium. Here’s the example with isobutyraldehyde
(2-methylpropanal). The equilibrium constant is the concentration of hydrate at equilibrium
divided by the concentration of aldehyde, also at equilibrium.

[hydrate]

_K =_ = ca. 0.5

[aldehyde]


The concentrations of hydrate and aldehyde at equilibrium in water
may be determined by measuring the UV absorption of known concentrations of aldehyde in water and comparing these with the
absorptions in a solvent such as cyclohexane where no hydrate formation is possible. Such experiments reveal that the equilibrium constant for this reaction in water at 25 °C is approximately 0.5 so that
there is about twice as much aldehyde as hydrate in the equilibrium
mixture.
Using the equation above, we fi nd that the corresponding value for
ΔG is –8.314 × 298 × ln(0.5) = +1.7 kJ mol[−][1]. In other words, the solution
of the hydrate in water is 1.7 kJ mol[−][1] higher in energy than the solution
of the aldehyde in water. All this can be shown on an energy profi le
diagram.

###### The sign of ΔG tells us whether products or reactants are favoured at equilibrium


reaction coordinate


In the equilibrium above, the hydrate is higher in energy than the aldehyde: at equilibrium
there is more aldehyde than hydrate, and the equilibrium constant is therefore less than 1.
Whenever this is the case (i.e. the equilibrium lies to the side of the reactants, rather than the

- The sign of ΔG for a reaction

hundreds of years! This will be
dealt with later.


products) K will be less than 1. This means that its logarithm must be negative and, because
ΔG = –RTlnK, ΔG must be positive. Conversely, for a reaction in which products are favoured
over reactants, K must be greater than 1, its logarithm will be positive, and hence ΔG must be
negative. When K is exactly 1, since ln 1 = 0, ΔG will be zero.



- ΔG tells us about the position of equilibrium.

**•** **If ΔG for a reaction is negative, the products will be favoured at equilibrium.**

**•** **If ΔG for a reaction is positive, the reactants will be favoured at equilibrium.**

**•** **If ΔG for a reaction is zero, the equilibrium constant for the reaction will be 1.**

kcal (kilocalories) mol[−1].
1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. The ‘calories’
counted by nutritionists are in
fact kilocalories; the typical
energy output of a human adult
is 10,000 kJ per day.


###### A small change in ΔG makes a big difference in K

The tiny difference in energy between the hydrate and the aldehyde (1.7 kJ mol[−][1] is small: the
strength of a typical C–C bond is about 350 kJ mol[−][1]) gave an appreciable difference in the equilibrium composition. This is because of the logarithm term in the equation ΔG = –RTlnK: relatively small energy differences have a very large effect on K. The table below shows the equilibrium
constants, K, that correspond to energy differences, ΔG, between 0 and 50 kJ mol[−][1]. These are relatively small energy differences, but the equilibrium constants change by enormous amounts.

Variation of K with ΔG

15 430 99.8

20 3200 99.97

50 580 000 000 99.9999998

In a typical chemical reaction, ‘driving an equilibrium over to products’ might mean
getting, say, 98% of the products and only 2% of starting materials. You can see in the
table that this requires an equilibrium constant of just over 50 and an energy difference
of only 10 kJ mol[−][1]. This small energy difference is quite enough—after all, a yield of 98%
is rather good!

###### How to make the equilibrium favour the product you want

 The direct formation of esters

The formation and hydrolysis of esters was discussed in Chapter 10 where we established that
acid and ester are in equilibrium and that the equilibrium constant is about 1. Since
the position of the equilibrium favours neither the starting materials nor the products, how
can we manipulate the conditions of the reaction if we actually want to make 100% ester?

-----

The important point is that, at any one particular temperature, the equilibrium constant is
just that—constant. This gives us a means of forcing the equilibrium to favour the products (or
reactants) since the ratio between them must remain constant. Imagine what happens if we
add more methanol to the reaction above. [MeOH] increases, but the overall value of K has to
stay the same. The only way this can happen is if more of the ester converts to the acid.
Alternatively, imagine removing water from the equilibrium. [H2O] goes down, so to bring K
back to the value of 1, the concentrations of acid and methanol are going to have to go down
too, by converting themselves to ester and water.

This is exactly how the equilibrium is manipulated in practice. One way to make esters
in the laboratory is to use a large excess of the alcohol and remove water continually from
the system as it is formed, for example by distilling it out. This means that in the equilibrium mixture there is a tiny quantity of water, lots of the ester, lots of the alcohol, and
very little of the carboxylic acid; in other words, we have converted the carboxylic acid
into the ester. We must still use an acid catalyst, but the acid must be anhydrous since we
do not want any water present—commonly used acids are toluenesulfonic acid (tosic acid,
TsOH), concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), or gaseous HCl. The acid catalyst does not
alter the position of the equilibrium; it simply speeds up the rate of the reaction, allowing
equilibrium to be reached more quickly. This is an important point that we will come back
to shortly.

###### Typical method for making an ester

Refl ux the carboxylic acid with an excess of the alcohol (or the alcohol with an excess of the
carboxylic acid) with about 3–5% of a mineral acid (usually HCl or H2SO4) as a catalyst and
distil out the water that is formed in the reaction. For example, butanol was heated under
refl ux with a fourfold excess of acetic acid and a catalytic amount of concentrated H2SO4 to
give butyl acetate in a yield of 70%.



- ‘Refl ux’ means boil
underneath a condenser, so that
the boiling solvent constantly
runs back into the reaction and
is not lost.

It may also help to distil out the water that is formed in the reaction: diethyl adipate
(the diethyl ester of hexanedioic acid) can be made in toluene solution using a sixfold
excess of ethanol, concentrated H2SO4 as catalyst, heating in toluene, and distilling out
the water using a Dean Stark apparatus. You can tell from the yield that the equilibrium is
very favourable.

In these cases the equilibrium is made more favourable by using an excess of reagents and/
or removing one of the products. The equilibrium constant remains the same.



- The high temperatures and
acid catalysis are used to speed
up arrival at equilibrium, which
would otherwise take several
days. This aspect of reactivity—
the rate of the reaction, rather
than the position of the
equilibrium—will be dealt with
shortly.


-----

- That equation again:
ΔG = −RT lnK



- If you are interested in the
derivation of this equation,
which is an expression of the
second law of thermodynamics,
you will need to consult a
textbook of physical chemistry.
But you will be able to follow
the explanations below without
knowing the background to the
equation.


###### Typical method for hydrolysing an ester

Almost all methods for hydrolysing an ester in order to convert it back to an acid and an alcohol simply make use of excess water. Increasing [H2O] forces more acid and alcohol to form
to restore the equilibrium, and in favourable situations high yields of the acid and alcohol
are formed.

###### Entropy is important in determining equilibrium constants

The equation we introduced on p. 243 tells us that an equilibrium favours whichever of the
reactants or products has lower energy. But you might reasonably ask this question: why does
it just favour the components with lower energy? Why do you get any of the higher energy
ones at all? For the hydration on p. 243, for example, the hydrate is 1.7 kJ mol[−][1] higher in
energy than the starting aldehyde, so why does the aldehyde react at all? Surely the equilibrium would attain a lower energy state, not with just an excess of aldehyde over hydrate, but
with no hydrate at all?
The answer is due to entropy, a measure of disorder. Even when there is a difference in energy
between the starting materials and products in an equilibrium, you still get some of the less
stable components. Put simply, having a mixture of components is favourable because a mixture has higher entropy than a pure compound, and equilibria tend to maximize overall
entropy. This may be quite a new concept to you, so we will now work our way stepwise
through these ideas.

###### Energy, enthalpy, and entropy: ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS

The equation in the margin just above tells us that the sign and magnitude of the energy ΔG
are the only things that matter in deciding whether an equilibrium goes in one direction or
another. If ΔG is negative the equilibrium will favour the products and if ΔG is large and negative the reaction can go to completion. The table on p. 244 tells us that it is enough for ΔG to
be only about –10 kJ mol[−][1] to get complete reaction. But we haven’t yet considered what ΔG
actually corresponds to physically.
To do this we need to introduce our second equation. The free energy of a reaction, ΔG, is
related to two other quantities, the enthalpy of reaction, ΔH, and the entropy of reaction, ΔS,
by the equation:

ΔG = ΔH – TΔS

As before, _T is the temperature of the reaction in kelvin. Enthalpy,_ _H, is a measure of_
heat, and the change in enthalpy, ΔH, in a chemical reaction is the heat given out or taken
**up in that reaction. Reactions which give out heat are called exothermic, and have negative**
ΔH; reactions which take in heat are called endothermic and have positive ΔH. Since breaking bonds requires energy and making bonds liberates energy, the enthalpy change gives
an indication of whether the products have more stable bonds than the starting materials
or not.
Entropy, S, is a measure of the disorder in the system, so ΔS represents the entropy difference—the change in disorder—between the starting materials and the products. More disorder gives a positive ΔS; less disorder a negative ΔS.
So ΔG represents a combination of heat and disorder. But what does this mean for you as a
chemist wanting to get a reaction to work the way you want it to? We know that for a favourable change (i.e. an equilibrium favouring products) ΔG must be negative—in fact the more
negative the better, as this gives a larger equilibrium constant. Since ΔG = ΔH – TΔS, we get a
large, negative ΔG most readily if:

**1.** ∆H is negative, i.e. the reaction is exothermic.

and

**2.** ∆S is positive (and hence –T∆S is negative), i.e. the reaction becomes more disordered.


-----

Of course, we can still get a negative ΔG from an endothermic reaction (i.e. from a positive
ΔH) but only if the reaction products are more disordered than the starting materials; likewise
a reaction which becomes more ordered as it proceeds can still be favourable, but only if it is
exothermic to compensate for the loss of entropy.
Because of the factor _T multiplying the entropy term, both the equilibrium constant_ _K_
(which depends on ΔG) and the relative importance of the two quantities (ΔH and ΔS) will
vary with temperature (entropy changes are more important at higher temperatures). We’ll
now look at some examples to see how this works in practice.

###### Enthalpy versus entropy—some examples

Entropy dominates equilibrium constants in the difference between inter- and intramolecular reactions. In Chapter 6 we explained that hemiacetal formation is often an equilibrium,
with neither starting materials nor products strongly favoured. The addition of ethanol to
acetaldehyde shown below on the left, for example, has an equilibrium constant not far from
1. Overall, ΔG must therefore be approximately 0 (in fact it’s very slightly positive). The
_enthalpy change associated with the reaction is the result of the change in bonding: in this_
case, a C=O double bond becomes two C–O single bonds, and these two single bonds are
marginally more stable than the C=O double bond, therefore ΔH is slightly negative. But
working against this is the fact that every molecule of hemiacetal that forms consumes two
molecules of starting material. Decreasing the number of molecules (and moving from a mixture of aldehyde and alcohol towards pure hemiacetal) leads to an increase in the order of the
mixture—in other words a decrease in entropy. ΔS is negative, so the –TΔS is positive, just about
counterbalancing the small negative ΔH, and giving a slightly positive ΔG.

intermolecular hemiacetal formation intramolecular hemiacetal formation


A mixture has more entropy than
a pure substance because there
are many more ways of arranging
a mixture. Imagine lining up every
molecule in a mole of substance
and a mole of a 1:1 mixture. For
the pure substance, each member
of the line of molecules has to be
the same. For the mixture, at
every position in the line there is
a choice of two alternatives,
giving a huge number of possible
arrangements.

**OH**

∆H is small and negative because C=O double bond is
slightly less stable than 2 x C–O single bonds

∆S is negative because the one molecule of product is
intrinsically less disordered than the two molecules of
starting material


∆H is again small and negative because C=O double bond
is slightly less stable than 2 x C–O single bonds

∆S is no longer negative: there is no decrease in the
number of molecules in this reaction


Since ∆G = ∆H – T∆S, ∆G is positive Since ∆G = ∆H – T∆S, ∆G is negative
and the equilibrium lies to the left and the equilibrium lies to the right

The reaction on the right is different because it is an intramolecular reaction: the hydroxyl
group and aldehyde lie in the same molecule. ΔH will have essentially the same value as in the
intermolecular reaction on the left, but as the intramolecular reaction progresses, one molecule stays one molecule—there is consequently a much less signifi cant decrease in entropy.
Our TΔS term no longer weighs against the negative ΔH term, making ΔG negative overall and
allowing the equilibrium to lie to the right.
In Chapter 11 we showed you how acetals can be used as base-stable protective groups to
prevent nucleophiles attacking carbonyl groups. The acetals we chose to use were cyclic compounds known as dioxolanes, for a very good reason: cyclic acetals are more resistant to
hydrolysis than their acyclic counterparts. They are also easier to make—they form quite
readily, even from ketones. Again, we have entropic factors to thank for their stability. For the
formation of an acyclic acetal (below on the left), three molecules go in and two come out, but
for a cyclic one, a cyclic acetal, two molecules go in (ketone plus diol) and two molecules come
out (acetal plus water), so the usually unfavourable ΔS factor is no longer against us.

###### Equilibrium constants vary with temperature

We have said (p. 245) that the equilibrium constant is a constant only as long as the temperature
does not change. We can work out exactly how the equilibrium constant varies with temperature
by putting our two all-important equations ΔG = _–RTlnK and ΔG_ = ΔH – TΔS together to make

–RTlnK = ΔH – TΔS

If we divide throughout by –RT we have

_H_ _S_
ln K = − [∆] + [∆]
_RT_ _R_

This equation separates the equilibrium constant K into enthalpy and entropy terms, but it
is the enthalpy term that determines how K varies with temperature. Plotting ln K against 1/T
would give us a straight line with slope –ΔH/R and intercept ΔS/R. Since T (the temperature in
kelvin) is always positive, whether the slope is positive or negative depends on the sign of ΔH:
if ΔH is negative then, as temperature increases, ln K (and hence K) increases. In other words,
if the reaction is exothermic (that is, gives out heat) then at higher temperatures the equilibrium constant will be smaller. For an endothermic reaction, as the temperature is increased,
the equilibrium constant increases.

###### Some reactions are reversible on heating: cracking

Notice that the equation above also tells us that enthalpy becomes a less important contributor
to the equilibrium constant as temperature increases, so the higher the temperature, the more
important is the entropy term. This fact means that some reactions favour one side of the equilibrium at low temperature but the other at high temperature. Here is an example: the dimerization of cyclopentadiene. You will meet the mechanism of this reaction in Chapter 34, but for


-----

now we can just treat it as a simple dimerization reaction in which two C = C π bonds are
replaced by two C–C σ bonds—enthalpically a very favourable process because σ bonds are
stronger than π bonds. On standing at low temperature, cyclopentadiene converts to the dimer
even though two monomer molecules have more entropy than one molecule of the dimer.

But on heating, the dimer breaks down to give monomeric cyclopentadiene: the equilibrium
constant now favours the starting materials. As we predicted, because the reaction is exothermic, heating it makes it less favourable. You can also think of it in terms of our earlier equation
ΔG = ΔH – TΔS: at low temperature, the large negative ΔH term dominates, and ΔG is large and
negative too. But as T increases, the positive ΔS becomes more important, and eventually TΔS
overtakes ΔH and ΔG becomes positive, and the reaction now favours starting materials.
If you want to use cyclopentadiene, you have to heat the dimer to ‘crack’ it (‘cracking’ is the
term used for getting monomers from dimers or polymers). If you lazily leave the monomer
overnight and plan to do your reaction tomorrow, you will return in the morning to fi nd dimer.
This idea becomes even more pointed when we look at polymerization. Polyvinyl chloride
is the familiar plastic PVC and is made by reaction of large numbers of monomeric vinyl chloride molecules. There is, of course, an enormous decrease in entropy in this reaction any
polymerization will not occur above a certain temperature. Some polymers can be depolymerized at high temperatures and this can be the basis for recycling.

Everything decomposes at a

###### Le Châtelier’s principle

You may well be familiar with a rule that helps to predict how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in external
conditions—Le Châtelier’s principle. This says that if we disturb a system at equilibrium it will respond so as to minimize the effect of the disturbance. An example of a disturbance is adding more starting material to a reaction mixture at
equilibrium. What happens? More product is formed to use up this extra material. This is a consequence of the equilibrium
constant being, well..., constant and hardly needs anybody’s principle.
Another disturbance is heating. If a reaction under equilibrium is heated, how the equilibrium changes depends on
whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. If it is exothermic (that is, gives out heat), Le Châtelier’s principle would
predict that, since heat is consumed in the reverse reaction, more of the starting materials will be formed. Again no ‘principle’ is needed—this change occurs because the equilibrium constant is smaller at higher temperatures in an exothermic
reaction. Avoid using principles and rules without understanding the science underneath them or you may fi nd yourself
playing with fi re (which incidentally most defi nitely does not obey Le Châtelier’s principle, for very good reasons...).

###### Introducing kinetics: how to make reactions go faster and cleaner

Although in chemistry laboratories you will see lots of reactions being heated, very rarely will
this be to alter the equilibrium position. This is because most reactions are not carried out
reversibly and so the ratio of products to reactants is not an equilibrium ratio. The main reason chemists heat up reactions is simple—it speeds them up. The study of the rates of reactions, as opposed to their equilibrium states, is known as kinetics.



- **Thermodynamics is concerned with equilibria; kinetics is concerned with rates.**


###### How fast do reactions go? Activation energies

The combustion of the hydrocarbon shown below, the major component of petrol (gasoline)
trivially known as ‘isooctane’, proceeds with ΔG = –1000 kJ mol[−][1] at 298 K.



- ‘Isooctane’ is the trivial name
of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.


**(l)** **+  O2 (g)** **8 CO2(g)  +  9 H2O(l)**

'isooctane' ∆G = –1000 kJ mol[–1]


The differences between Ea and
ΔG[‡] need not concern us here;
you will fi nd the details in a
textbook of physical chemistry.


The table on p. 244 shows that even a ΔG of only –50 kJ mol[−][1] gives rise to a huge equilibrium
constant: –1000 kJ mol[−][1] gives an equilibrium constant of 10[175] (at 298 K), a number too vast
to contemplate (there are ‘only’ about 10[86] atoms in the observable universe). This value of ΔG
(or the corresponding value for the equilibrium constant) suggests that isooctane simply
could not exist in the presence of oxygen. Yet we put it into the fuel tanks of our cars every
day—clearly something is wrong.
Since isooctane can exist in an atmosphere of oxygen despite the fact that the equilibrium
position really would be completely on the side of the combustion products, the only conclusion
we can draw must be that a mixture of isooctane and oxygen cannot be at equilibrium. A small
burst of energy is needed to reach equilibrium: in a car engine, the spark plug provides this
energy and combustion occurs. Without this burst of energy, the petrol is stable and no combustion occurs (as you will ruefully be aware if you have ever tried to start a car with a fl at battery).
The mixture of petrol and oxygen is said to be thermodynamically unstable with respect to
the products of the reaction, CO2 and H2O, but kinetically stable. We can be certain that they
are thermodynamically unstable because even if the same small energy burst were applied to
the products CO2 and H2O, they would never convert back to petrol and oxygen.
_Kinetically stable means that although the mixture could convert to a more stable set of prod-_
ucts, it doesn’t do so because an energy barrier separates it from those products. An energy
level diagram for a reaction such as the combustion of isooctane is shown below. The products
are more stable (lower in energy) than the reactants, but to become the products, the reactants
have to overcome a barrier to reaction. This barrier is called the activation energy and is usually given the symbol Ea or ΔG[‡].

-----

If a reaction cannot proceed until the reactants have suffi cient energy to overcome the
activ ation energy barrier, it is clear that, the smaller the barrier, the easier it will be for the
reaction to proceed. Likewise, the more energy we give the starting materials in the form of
temperature, the more likely it is that they will collide with suffi cient combined energy to
cross the activation energy barrier. Unlike equilibria, which can change in either direction,
reaction rates always increase at higher temperatures.
A word of warning, however: heating is not all good for the chemist—not only does
it speed up the reaction we want, it will also probably speed up lots of other reactions that
we don’t want, including perhaps decomposition of the product! We shall see how we can
get round this, but fi rst we shall take a closer look at what determines how fast a reaction
takes place.

###### The route from reactants to products: the transition state


The combustion of kinetically stable fuel releases lots of energy by a very complex mechanism. To understand how energy is involved in the progress of a reaction we will need to take
a much more simple and familiar mechanism. The reduction of a ketone to an alcohol with
sodium borohydride will do. You met this reaction in Chapters 5 and 6 and it should by now
be a familiar part of your chemical vocabulary. An example is shown in the margin: in this
particular case, the ketone is rather hindered by the adjacent tert-butyl group, and the reaction must be heated to form the product. Evidently, then, there is an activation barrier that
must be overcome.
Let’s think about what that barrier might be. Although the fi nal product is an alcohol, as you
know well, the fi rst step is transfer of a hydrogen atom from boron to the carbonyl group, as
shown in the mechanism below. Overall, as shown in the energy profi le diagram, the products
of this step are more stable than the starting materials (ΔG is negative), but to get there the
reaction has to pass through the activation energy barrier (ΔG[‡]). This barrier—the highest
energy point on the profi le—must correspond to some structure (which we have shown in
square brackets) in which the hydrogen atom is only partly transferred from B to C, and the
carbonyl group is only partly broken. We call this structure—the highest energy form through
which the molecules must pass to get from reactants to products—the transition state. It is
often represented in square brackets, frequently with a double dagger symbol ‡ (to match the
activation energy ΔG[‡]).



- To draw a structure
representing a transition state is
easy: fi rst put in all the bonds
that are not affected by the
reaction, then use dotted bonds
for all those which break or
form as the reaction proceeds.
You will need to spread charge
over appropriate atoms, putting
a + or – in brackets to indicate
a partial charge.


**O** **NaBH4**
**EtOH**


**OH**


(–)


‡


**B**
**H**

Notice that the transition state has some features of the reactants and some features of the
products. The B–H bond is partly broken, so we represent it as a dotted line, and the new H–C
bond is partly formed, so likewise that is dotted too, as is the breaking C=O bond. The negative charge, which starts associated with B and ends on the oxygen atom, is shown in brackets
in both locations, to indicate that it is shared between them. It takes energy to get to the
transition state because the H has to move away from the B without signifi cant compensation.


Conventionally, charges in
brackets indicate a signifi cant
proportion, usually about 1/2, of
a charge, unlike ‘δ+ ‘ or ‘δ–’,
which might represent only 1/10
or 1/5 of a charge.


-----

But once the transition state is passed, the formation of a stable C–H bond and the migration
of a charge to electronegative oxygen means that stability is regained.
A transition state is always unstable and can never be isolated: if the reaction proceeds just
a little more forwards or backwards, the energy of the system is lower. Isolating a transition
state would be like balancing a marble on top of a bowling ball.



- **Transition state**

**A transition state is a structure that represents an energy maximum on passing from reactants**
**to products. It is not a real molecule in that it may have partially formed or broken bonds and**
**may have more atoms or groups around the central atom than allowed by valence bond rules. It**
**cannot be isolated because it is an energy maximum and any change in its structure leads to a**
**more stable arrangement. A transition state is often shown by putting it in square brackets with**
**a double-dagger superscript.**


###### Why some reactions are done at low temperature

So far in this chapter you have seen that while heating a reaction can change the position of
an equilibrium, the usual reason for heating a reaction is to speed it up by giving the reactants
more energy to allow them to overcome the activation barrier. But as we said in the introduction, in a typical laboratory you will see many reactions being carried out at low temperatures.
Why might a chemist want to slow a reaction down?
Well, often molecules can react in several different ways. A good reaction will have a lower
activation energy than these alternatives. But often there are other unavoidable reactions waiting in the wings that will compete with the one that is wanted if the molecules have enough
energy. The ideal situation is to give the starting materials enough energy to do the reaction we
want, but not enough to do anything else: and that means keeping the reaction cold.
A famous example of a reaction which must be kept cold is the diazotization of anilines to
make diazonium salts. The reaction involves treating the amine with nitrous acid (HONO)
made from NaNO2 and HCl. You need not think about the mechanism at this stage—you
will meet it in Chapter 22—but the key point is that the product is a rather unstable but very
useful diazonium salt. The diazotization takes place readily at room temperature, but unfortunately so does the decomposition of the product to give a phenol. By lowering the temperature, we supply insuffi cient energy for the phenol formation, but the diazotization still
works just fi ne.

The use of organolithiums (which you saw in Chapter 9) typically involves low temperatures,
often as low as –78 °C. Organolithiums are very reactive, and the addition or deprotonation
reactions they undergo have activation energies suffi ciently low that they proceed even at such
temperatures. However, they do also have a tendency to attack some of the solvents which they
dissolve best in, such as THF. If lithiations are attempted at higher temperatures, THF also reacts
with s-BuLi to give the surprising by-products discussed in Chapter 35.

Our mechanism for reduction of the ketone with borohydride is of course not yet complete:
there is another step to follow—the protonation of the alkoxide by the ethanol solvent. We
can add this step to our energy profi le diagram.

Now the product of the fi rst stage of the reaction is the starting material for the second, which
follows on straightaway because the activation energy for the second reaction, the proton transfer, is smaller than for the fi rst one. Notice that we have now labelled the middle set of structures, which includes the alkoxide ‘intermediate’. An intermediate is a staging post in a reaction
pathway: it is stable for a fi nite (if short) period. Unlike a transition state it is a minimum rather
than a maximum on the reaction energy profi le, and therefore has a fi nite existence—an intermediate could, in principle, be isolated, and many have been (particularly at low temperature).

matches the one here.



- **Intermediates and transition states**

**•** **A transition state represents an energy maximum—any small displacement leads to a**
**more stable product. It can never be isolated.**



**•** **An intermediate is a molecule or ion that represents a localized energy minimum—an**
**energy barrier must be overcome before the intermediate forms something more stable. An**
**intermediate can in principle be isolated (although in practice its high energy can make this**
**diffi cult).**

###### Catalysis

You’ve met the idea in several places in this book (and probably elsewhere)
that a catalyst increases the rate of a reaction. From what you have just read,
it must therefore be the case that a catalyst lowers the activation energy for
a reaction. It can do this in one or both of two ways: it can lower the energy
of the transition state (as shown in the diagram on the left, or it can raise the
energy of the starting materials.

reaction coordinate


To illustrate the point with one simple example, let’s take a reaction which simply does not
work without a catalyst: the isomerization of butene. As you saw on p. 105, cis but-2-ene is
about 2 kJ mol[−][1] higher in energy than trans but-2-ene. This small energy difference would correspond to a 2.2:1, 70:30, trans:cis ratio of alkenes if they were in equilibrium. But it’s a big if:
the activation energy needed to get from one to the other is of the order of 260 kJ mol[−][1], which
is practically unattainable. A quick calculation predicts that the half-life for the reaction would
be approximately 10[25] years at room temperature, a time many orders of magnitude longer
than the age of the universe. At 500 °C, however, the half-life is a more reasonable 4 hours, but
unfortunately, when most alkenes are heated to these sorts of temperatures other unwanted
reactions occur.
In order to interconvert the cis and trans isomers we must use a different strategy: catalysis.
You will meet several ways of doing this in Chapter 27, but for the moment we will use just one:
catalytic acid. As you saw in Chapter 5, alkenes are nucleophiles, and either isomer of but-2-ene
can react with H[+] from acid to form a transient species known as a carbocation. The activation
energy for formation of the carbocation is much less than that for rotation about the C = C
bond. The carbocation can now easily lose a proton again, to reform either cis- or trans-but-2ene, regenerating the catalyst and allowing the interconversion to take place. Overall, the
activation energy is much lower than in the uncatalysed reaction. We will come back to other
examples of catalysis later in the chapter.

You have already seen a case in
this chapter, and you met many in
Chapter 9, where THF (or diethyl
ether) was used as the solvent for
organolithium reactions: it
coordinates to Li and solubilizes
the organometallic compounds.
Alcohol solvents cannot be used
with organolithiums because they
are deprotonated by the strong
organolithium bases.


###### Solvents

The nature of the solvent used in reactions often has a profound effect on how the reaction
proceeds. Sometimes, if the solvent is also a reagent, the choice is easy: it’s a good idea to carry
out hydrolyses of esters in water and formations of esters in the appropriate alcohol because


-----

the large concentration of the solvent drives the reaction towards the product, as explained
on p. 208. Likewise, the solvent may also catalyse a reaction: ester formation from an acid
chloride and an alcohol is often carried out in pyridine as a solvent because pyridine acts as a
base catalyst of the reaction (p. 199).
On occasions, the choice of solvent is limited by simple features of the starting materials
and products, such as their solubility or reactivity. Simple examples are cases where an inorganic salt is a reagent: ionic compounds are relatively insoluble in most organic solvents.
Sodium bromide, for example, dissolves well in water, reasonably well in methanol, a little in
ethanol, and hardly at all in most other organic solvents.

The insolubility of some salts in organic solvents can be used to drive an equilibrium in the direction required. For example, in the synthesis of this alkyl iodide from the alkyl bromide by reaction with sodium iodide, acetone is used as the
solvent. Why? Well, sodium iodide is rather more soluble in acetone than is sodium bromide, so as sodium bromide is
removed from the equilibrium mixture, more of the starting materials have to convert to the products to restore the
equilibrium constant. You will meet more on this reaction in Chapter 15.

Water dissolves sodium bromide well because it solvates both cations and anions: electrostatic interactions with its δ– oxygen atoms can stabilize the positive sodium ions,
while attraction to its δ+ hydrogen atoms can stabilize the negative bromide ion. Solvents
which have polarized bonds like this are known as _polar. Water and other alcohols are_
also called protic solvents because they have δ+ protons that can interact readily with
anions.

Water solvates cations and anions DMSO (a polar aprotic solvent) solvates only cations

Another group of polar solvents lack δ+ protons: these are the polar aprotic solvents, such as
DMSO or DMF. Although they have a localized δ– at oxygen, which can solvate cations, they
are much less good at solvating anions because their molecules do not have a localized accessible δ+ region. In Chapter 10 (p. 213) you met a specifi c combination of t-BuOK and DMSO to
help hydrolyse an amide. This is why DMSO is used here: it solvates the K[+] cation, leaving the
_t-BuO[−] unstabilized by solvation. It is desperate to become neutral by fi nding a proton. Metal_
alkoxides in DMSO are extremely basic, and when even sodium chloride is dissolved in DMSO
the usually innocuous chloride ion becomes quite a powerful nucleophile, as you will see in
Chapter 25.
A third group of solvents are not polar at all, but may still dissolve organic molecules quite
well. These include hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents (chloroform), and aromatic solvents
(toluene, benzene).
The table below groups common solvents in classes with shared features, and also indicates
their polarity. Polarity is measured in various ways—here we give the ‘dielectric constants’—
but you do not need to remember the numbers. Learning the general position of a solvent in
this sequence of polarity will, however, be a wise investment of your time.

By virtue of their ability or inability to solvate charged species, solvents can affect the
course of reactions by stabilizing or destabilizing a transition state or an intermediate. Here’s
a very simple example: the effect of solvent on one of the fi rst ‘reactions’ in this chapter—the
rotation about the C–N bond of an amide. The table in the margin shows the activation
energy ΔG[‡] for C–N bond rotation in dimethylacetamide (DMA) in a range of solvents. You
can immediately deduce that the rate of the rotation is fastest in the least polar solvent,
cyclohexane, because the barrier is lowest. Why might this be?
To understand rates, we have to think about activation energies, in other words the difference in energy between the starting materials and the transition state. As you know, an amide
in its ground state (in other words, its lowest energy state) is delocalized because of conjugation between the nitrogen’s lone pair and the carbonyl group. This delocalization leads to a
degree of charge separation and polarization of the amide. But as the C–N bond rotates, the
conjugation is broken because the molecule has to pass through a transition state in which the
N lone pair is perpendicular to the π system of the carbonyl group. The transition state is
therefore less polar than the ground state.
Now, if we compare the effect on this rotation of a non-polar solvent and a polar solvent,
this is what will happen. The polar ground state will be stabilized by the polar solvent, and so
will be lower in energy, as you see on the right of the diagram below. But the less polar transition state will have about the same energy, whatever the polarity of the solvent. So, in a polar
solvent, the amount of energy required to get from the ground state to the transition state
(this is the activation energy, Ea or ΔG[‡]) is greater than in a non-polar solvent, and bond rotation is slower.

In Chapter 15 you will go on to meet a pair of mechanisms in which the polarity of the
transition state is very different. You will now be prepared to expect some very signifi cant
solvent effects when such reactions take place.

**•** **participating as a reagent**

**•** **acting as a catalyst**

**•** **dissolving the reagents**

**•** **differentially stabilizing the ground state and transition state.**


###### Rate equations

We’ve pointed out that reactions go faster at higher temperature because the starting materials have more energy. But temperature is not the sole controller of rate. Two molecules might
well collide with plenty of energy, but unless they are two molecules that can actually react,
that energy will be lost as heat. Going back again to the reduction of p. 251 (a reminder in the
margin), it’s obvious that only collisions between ketone (A) and borohydride (B) get us anywhere—there will be plenty of non-productive collisions between **A and** **A or** **B and** **B.**
Obviously the chance of a collision between A and B is increased the more of each you have,
and especially if you have lots of A _and lots of B. In fact, the chance of a successful reaction is_
proportional to the product of the concentration of A and the concentration of B. We can
express this in a simple rate equation:

rate of reaction = _k_ × [A] × [B]

where the value k represents the rate constant for the reaction. The value of k is different for
different reactions, and it also varies with temperature. The size of k also contains information about how likely it is that the molecules will collide with the right orientation. We call
this analysis of the factors affecting the rate of the reactions the kinetics of the reaction.


We discussed the simple ideas
about what must happen for a
reaction to take place between
two molecules at the start of
Chapter 5. We’re now adding more
detail to those simple concepts.

There is of course a link between the activation energy of a reaction and its rate, and the connection between them is
known as the Arrhenius equation, after the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius (1859–1927) who formulated it and won
the Nobel Prize in 1903.

k = Ae[−][E][a/][RT]

where k is the rate constant for the reaction, R is the gas constant (see p. 243), T is the temperature (in kelvin), and A is
a quantity known as the pre-exponential factor. Because of the minus sign in the exponential term, the larger the activation energy, Ea, the slower the reaction but the higher the temperature, the faster the reaction.


As we discussed on p. 253, the reaction between borohydride and the ketone to make an alkoxide is only the fi rst step of this reaction. Since ethanol likewise has to collide with the alkoxide
for this second step to take place, you might very reasonably ask yourself why the rate of formation of the alcohol product does not also depend on [EtOH]: why is the rate equation not

rate of reaction = _k_ × [ketone] × [borohydride] × [EtOH] ?

The answer is hinted at in the energy profi le diagram you saw on p. 253, which is reproduced below. The activation energy for the proton transfer step is lower than for the addition
step, so it happens faster. It fact, it can happen fast whatever the concentration of ethanol, so
ethanol does not appear in the rate equation. The overall rate of any reaction is determined
only by what happens in the mechanistic step that is slowest, known as the rate-determining
**step or rate-limiting step. This is a general point about anything that happens in several**

At several points in Chapters 6, 9, 10, and 11 we have said things like ‘don’t worry about the
details of the proton transfers’ and now you know why: proton transfers between N and O
atoms are fast, and other steps are almost always rate determining. It doesn’t really matter how
you get a proton from one electronegative atom to another—in reality it will be fl itting all
over the place and any reasonable route is just as correct as any other.

###### Kinetics gives us an insight into the mechanism of a reaction

In Chapters 10 and 11 you met some other multistep reactions with intermediates. Take this
example: an alkoxide RO[−] will react with an acid chloride to form an ester. If we measure how
the rate of the formation of the ester varies with the concentration of the alkoxide and of the
acid chloride, we discover a rate equation


rate = _k[MeCOCl][RO[−]]_

Both the acid chloride and alkoxide must therefore be involved in the rate-determining
step, which, as you know from Chapter 10, must be the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate. This intermediate is less stable than the starting materials, so the reaction energy
profi le takes the form shown below, with the highest transition state corresponding to the
addition step.


-----

rate-determining step


reaction coordinate

The presence of two species in the rate equation confi rms that the reaction is bimolecular
(i.e. it involves two molecules), and we call such rate equations second order.
Numerous kinetic studies have confi rmed that this mechanism, with a tetrahedral intermediate, is the normal pathway by which substitution reactions at carbonyl groups take place, as
we explained in Chapter 10. You could draw a similar pathway, and a similar energy profi le,
for all of the reactions shown on p. 215, adjusting the energies of the starting materials, products, and intermediates appropriately, but all of them are second order, with rate-limiting
attack on the carbonyl group.
However, there are occasional exceptions. These are not important enough for you to consider them likely when you write substitution mechanisms, but they do illustrate the fact that
_kinetics tells us about mechanism._
Here is one: when an acid chloride is heated with an alcohol in the absence of base, an ester
forms. However, it turns out that under these conditions the rate equation is fi rst order: it does
not matter how much or how little alcohol is added, the rate depends only on the concentration of the acid chloride:


**O**


**R[2]OH**


**O**


**R[1]** **Cl** _no base_ **R[1]** **OR**

acid chloride ester


rate of reaction = _k[R[1]COCl]_

Evidently, from the rate equation, no collision between the acid chloride and the alcohol is
required for this reaction to go. The rate-determining step must be unimolecular. What actually happens is that the acid chloride decomposes by itself to give a reactive cation with the
loss of the good leaving group Cl[−].



- This is not the recommended
way to make an ester: the
reaction is much better if a base
is added, in which case it
follows the usual addition–
elimination mechanism.

There are three steps in this reaction scheme, although the last is a trivial deprotonation.
The energy barrier must be highest in the fi rst step, which involves the acid chloride alone.
The cation is an intermediate (although a short-lived one) with a real existence that reacts
rapidly with the alcohol in a step that does not affect the rate of the reaction. The easiest way
to picture this detail is in an energy profi le diagram:


-----

transition state


reaction coordinate

Notice that the products are again lower in energy than the starting materials, and although
there are three transition states in this reaction, only the highest-energy transition state (the
fi rst one here) matters in determining the reaction rate. The reaction now passes through two
intermediates (local minima). It is often the case that when intermediates are involved in a
reaction, the highest-energy transition state is associated with the formation of the highestenergy intermediate.


###### What does third-order kinetics mean?

The fi rst-order kinetics of this unusual substitution reaction is here to illustrate a point, but it
should not distract you from the fact that most nucleophilic substitutions of carboxylic acid
derivatives (the reactions you met in Chapter 10) are bimolecular reactions with ratedetermining formation of the tetrahedral intermediate.

However, something different again happens when we come to reactions of amides. Because
of the delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the carbonyl group, nucleophilic attack on
the carbonyl group is very diffi cult. In addition, the leaving group (NH2−, with pKa of NH3
about 35) is very bad indeed.

What happens as a consequence is that in the hydrolysis of amides the second step—the
breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate—becomes rate determining. But this offers the
opportunity for base catalysis of this step. If a second hydroxide ion removes the proton from
the tetrahedral intermediate, the loss of NH2 from what is now a dianion is made easier, and
a stable carboxylate ion is formed directly.

Notice that in the fi rst mechanism just one hydroxide ion is involved, whereas now two are
involved: one is consumed to form product, but the second is in fact regenerated when the
product NH2− anion reacts with water—in other words the second hydroxide ion is a catalyst.
The rate equation for the amide hydrolysis refl ects this involvement of two hydroxide ions:
the rate depends on the square of the hydroxide ion concentration and it is third order. We’ll
label the rate constant k3 to emphasize this:

rate = _k3[MeCONH2] × [HO[−]][2]_

But you may be asking yourself where this third-order kinetics comes from, since the
hydroxide ions are not actually involved in the rate-determining step. In fact, third-order
kinetics hardly ever mean the real simultaneous termolecular collision of three molecules at
once—such events are just too rare.
The rate-determining step here is actually unimolecular—the collapse of the dianion. So we
expect

rate = _k[dianion]_

We don’t know the concentration of the dianion but we do know that it’s in equilibrium
with the monoanion—we’ll call this equilibrium constant K2:

[dianion]
_K2_ = [monoanion][HO− ]

and so [dianion] = _K2[monanion][HO[−]]._
This sort of helps, but we still don’t know what [monoanion] is, other than that it’s again in
equilibrium, this time with the amide—we’ll call this equilibrium constant K1:

_K1 =_ [[]monoanion]

[amide HO][ [−] ]

and so [monoanion] = _K1[amide][HO[−]]._
Substituting these values in the simple rate equation we discover that

rate = _k[dianion] becomes_

rate = _kK1K2[amide][HO[−]][2]_

The third-order kinetics result from two equilibria starting with the amide and involving two
hydroxide ions, followed by a unimolecular rate-determining step, and the ‘third-order rate constant’ k3 is actually a product of the two equilibrium constants and a fi rst-order rate constant:

_k3_ = _k_ × _K1_ × _K2_

This often happens with reactions with late rate-determining steps: the rate constant can
depend on the concentrations of any species involved before the rate-determining step
(although not necessarily in that step itself) but never depends on species involved after the
rate-determining step.


-----

- In Chapter 39 we will discuss
in much more detail how such
experiments are designed; much
sooner, in Chapter 15, you will
meet another pair of
mechanisms—one fi rst order
and one second order—that tell
us a lot about the reactivity of
the molecules involved.


Just because a proposed mechanism gives a rate equation that fi ts the experimental
data, it does not necessarily mean that it is the right mechanism; all it means is that it is
consistent with the experimental facts so far, but there may be other mechanisms that
also fi t. It is then up to the experimenter to design cunning experiments to try to rule out
other possibilities.
Mechanisms are given throughout this book—eventually you will learn to predict what
mechanism to expect for a given type of reaction, but this is because earlier experimentalists
have worked out the mechanisms by a study of kinetics and other methods.

###### Catalysis in carbonyl substitution reactions

The amide hydrolysis you have just met is much faster in base because base (in this case
hydroxide) deprotonates the intermediate and makes it more reactive. The same is true for
many other base-catalysed processes: often it is the nucleophile that is made more reactive by
deprotonation to form an anion. For example, ester hydrolysis is faster at higher pH because
the higher the pH the more hydroxide there is to act as a nucleophile.

The rate equation at high pH is second order, as you expect, and depends on the concentration of hydroxide and the concentration of the ester. Notice, though, that below pH 7 the rate
starts to increase again as the concentration of [H[+]] increases. This is because ester hydrolysis
is also acid catalysed, as you saw in Chapter 10. At acidic pH, a new mechanism takes over in
which protonation of the carbonyl group accelerates attack of weakly nucleophilic water.

- You will also see rate
constants labelled in other
ways—this is a matter of
choice. A common method is to
use k1 for fi rst-order, k2 for
second-order, and k3 for thirdorder rate constants, for
example.


**H**

The reaction is still bimolecular but the rate constant is different: we can represent the two
processes by two rate equations, labelling the rate constants ka and kb with the suffi xes ‘a’ for
acid and ‘b’ for base to show more clearly what we mean:

rate of ester hydrolysis in acid (pH < 7) solution = _ka[MeCO2R][H3O[+]]_

rate of ester hydrolysis in basic (pH > 7) solution = _kb[MeCO2R][HO[−]]_

This is typical acid–base catalysis, known as ‘specifi c acid–base catalysis’ because the specifi c
acid and base involved are H[+] (or H3O[+]) and OH[−]. The form of the pH dependence of the rate tells
us that there is a choice of two mechanisms—the one that is faster is the one that is observed.
You met a reaction in Chapter 11 whose rate has a very different pH dependence: imine
formation. To remind you, here is the mechanism again. We pointed out in Chapter 11 that

the reaction is acid catalysed because acid is needed to help water leave. But too much acid is
a problem because it protonates the starting amine and slows the reaction down.

The difference now is that at low pH, the rate-determining step changes from being the
dehydration step (which can then go very fast because of the high concentration of acid) to
being the addition step, which is slowed down by protonation of the amine. Whereas a reaction will always go by the fastest of the available mechanisms, it is also bound to go at the rate
of the slowest step in that mechanism.

**The overall rate of a multistep reaction is decided by:**

**•** **the fastest of the available mechanisms**

**•** **the slowest of the possible rate-determining steps.**


-----

This type of catalysis, which is available to any base, not only strong bases, is called general base catalysis and will be
discussed more in Chapter 39. It does not speed the reaction up very much but it does lower the energy of the transition
state leading to the tetrahedral intermediate by avoiding the build-up of positive charge as the alcohol adds. The disadvantage of general base catalysis is that the fi rst, rate-determining, step really is termolecular (unlike in the amide
hydrolysis mechanism you met on p. 261). It is inherently unlikely that three molecules will collide with each other
simultaneously. In this case, however, if ROH is the solvent, it will always be nearby in any collision so a termolecular step
is just about acceptable.


###### Kinetic versus thermodynamic products

We started this chapter with a discussion of thermodynamics: the factors that govern equilibria. We then moved onto rates: the factors that determine the rate at which reactions proceed.
Depending on the reaction, either may be more important, and in general:


There are further examples of
contrasting kinetic and
thermodynamic control in Chapters
19 and 22.


Before we leave this chapter, we will introduce an example of a reaction where thermodynamic control and kinetic control lead to different outcomes—in other words, where the
fastest reaction does not give the most stable possible product.
The reaction is one you have not yet met, but it is quite a simple one, and it follows an unsurprising mechanism. It is the reaction of an alkyne with hydrogen chloride in the presence of
alumina (Al2O3). The reaction produces two geometrical isomers of a chloroalkene.
Alkynes, like alkenes, are nucleophiles, and so the mechanism involves fi rst of all attack by
the alkyne on HCl, followed by recombination of the vinyl cation, which is formed with the
chloride anion.



**•** **Reactions under thermodynamic control have outcomes that depend on the position of an**
**equilibrium and therefore the relative stability of the possible products.**

**•** **Reactions under kinetic control have outcomes that depend on the rate at which the reaction**
**proceeds, and therefore on the relative energies of the transition states leading to the**
**alternative products.**

but it can be absorbed onto the
surface of the alumina for
convenient handling.

The two alkenes are labelled E and Z. After about 2 hours the main product is the Z-alkene.
However, this is not the case in the early stages of the reaction. The graph below shows how
the proportions of the starting material and the two products change with time.

 - When the alkyne concentration drops almost to zero (10 minutes), the only alkene
that has been formed is the E-alkene.


-----

- As time increases, the amount of E-alkene decreases as the amount of Z-alkene
increases.

- Eventually, the proportions of E- and Z-alkene do not change.


Since it is the Z-alkene that dominates at equilibrium, this must be lower in energy than the
_E-alkene. Since we know the ratio of the products at equilibrium, we can work out the differ-_
ence in energy between the two isomers:

ratio of E:Z-alkenes at equilibrium = 1:35



###### [Z] Keq = [ ]E = 35


ΔG = –RTlnK = –8.314 × 298 × ln(35) = –8.8 kJ mol[−][1]

that is, the Z-alkene is 8.8 kJ mol[−][1] lower in energy than the E-alkene.
However, although the Z-alkene is more stable, the E-alkene is formed faster under these
conditions: the route to the E-alkene must have a smaller activation energy barrier than trans
addition. This is quite easy to understand: the intermediate cation has no double-bond geometry because the cationic C is sp hybridized (linear). When chloride attacks, it prefers to attack
from the side of the H atom rather than the (bigger) methyl group.



- You might normally expect
an E-alkene to be more stable
than a Z-alkene—it just so
happens here that Cl has a
higher priority than Ph and the
Z-alkene has the two largest
groups (Ph and Me) trans (see
p. 392 for rules of
nomenclature).

There must then be some mechanism by which the quickly formed E-alkene is converted

This information can be summarized on an energy profi le diagram:

-----

Initially, the alkyne is converted into the E-alkene via the intermediate linear cation. The
activation energy for this step is labelled ΔG1[‡]. The E-alkene can convert to the Z isomer via an
intermediate, with activation energy ΔG2[‡]. Since ΔG1[‡] is smaller than ΔG2[‡], the E-alkene forms
faster than it isomerizes, and all the alkyne is rapidly converted to the E-alkene. But over the
course of the reaction, the E-alkene slowly isomerizes to the Z-alkene. An equilibrium is eventually reached that favours the Z-alkene because it is more stable (by 8.8 kJ mol[−][1], as we calculated earlier). Why doesn’t the Z-alkene form faster than the E? Well, as we suggested above,
the transition state for its formation from the linear cation must be higher in energy than the
transition state for formation of the E-alkene, because of steric hindrance.



- **Kinetic and thermodynamic products**

**•** **The E-alkene is formed faster and is known as the kinetic product or the product of**
**kinetic control.**

**•** **The Z-alkene is more stable and is known as the thermodynamic product or the product**
**of thermodynamic control.**


If we wanted to isolate the kinetic product, the E-alkene, we would carry out the reaction at
low temperature and not leave it long enough for equilibration. If, on the other hand, we want
the thermodynamic product, the Z-alkene, we would leave the reaction for longer at higher
temperatures to make sure that the larger energy barrier yielding the most stable product can
be overcome.

###### Summary of mechanisms from Chapters 6–12

In Chapter 5 we introduced basic arrow-drawing. A lot has happened since then and this is a
good opportunity to pull some strands together. You may like to be reminded:

**1.** When molecules react together, one is the electrophile and one is the nucleophile.

**2.** Electrons fl ow from an electron-rich to an electron-poor centre.

**3.** Charge is conserved in each step of a reaction.

These three considerations will help you draw the mechanism of a reaction that you have
not previously met.

###### The differences between carbon and proton NMR

We introduced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in Chapter 3 as part of a three-pronged
attack on the problem of determining molecular structure. We showed that mass spectrometry weighs the molecules, infrared spectroscopy tells us about functional groups, and [13]C
and [1]H NMR tell us about the hydrocarbon skeleton. We concentrated on [13]C NMR because
it’s simpler, and we were forced to admit that we were leaving the details of the most important technique of all—proton ([1]H) NMR—until a later chapter because it is more complicated than [13]C NMR. This is that chapter and we must now tackle those complications. We
hope you will see [1]H NMR for the beautiful and powerful technique that it surely is. The
diffi culties are worth mastering for this is the chemist’s primary weapon in the battle to
solve structures.


## 13



- **We will make use of [1]H and [13]C NMR evidence for structure throughout this book, and it is**
**essential that you are familiar with the explanations in this chapter before you read further.**


Proton NMR differs from [13]C NMR in a number of ways.

  - [1]H is the major isotope of hydrogen (99.985% natural abundance), while [13]C is only a
minor isotope (1.1%).

  - [1]H NMR is quantitative: the area under the peak tells us the number of hydrogen
nuclei, while [13]C NMR may give strong or weak peaks from the same number of [13]C
nuclei.

  - Protons interact magnetically (‘couple’) to reveal the connectivity of the structure,
while [13]C is too rare for coupling between [13]C nuclei to be seen.



- ‘[1]H NMR’ and ‘proton NMR’
are interchangeable terms. All
nuclei contain protons of course,
but chemists often use ‘proton’
specifi cally for the nucleus of a
hydrogen atom, either as part of
a molecule or in its ‘free’ form
as H[+]. This is how it will be used
in this chapter.

In Chapter 3 we illustrated the
alignment of nuclei using the
analogy of a compass needle in a
magnetic fi eld.



 - [1]H NMR shifts give a more reliable indication of the local chemistry than that given
by [13]C spectra.

We shall examine each of these points in detail and build up a full understanding of proton
NMR spectra.
Proton NMR spectra are recorded in the same way as [13]C NMR spectra: radio waves are used
to study the energy level differences of nuclei in a magnetic fi eld, but this time they are [1]H and
not [13]C nuclei. Hydrogen nuclei in a magnetic fi eld have two energy levels: they can be aligned
either with or against the applied magnetic fi eld.


nucleus aligned
against applied
magnetic field


higher energy
level


applied
magnetic
field


amount of energy
required to excite nucleus


nucleus aligned
with applied
magnetic field


lower
energy level



- All nuclei are characterized
by their ‘nuclear spin’, a value
known as I. The number of
energy levels available to a
nucleus of spin I is 2I + 1. [1]H
and [13]C both have I = 1/2.



- This 10 ppm scale is not the
same as any part of the [13]C
NMR spectrum. It is at a
different frequency altogether.


1H and 13C spectra have many similarities: the scale runs from right to left and the zero
point is given by the same reference compound, although it is the proton resonance of Me4Si
rather than the carbon resonance that defi nes the zero point. You will notice at once that the
scale is much smaller, ranging over only about 10 ppm instead of the 200 ppm needed for
carbon. This is because the variation in the chemical shift is a measure of the shielding of the
nucleus by the electrons around it. There is inevitably less change possible in the distribution
of two electrons around a hydrogen nucleus than in that of the eight valence electrons
around a carbon nucleus. Here is the [1]H NMR spectrum of acetic acid, which you fi rst saw in
Chapter 3.



- A reminder from Chapter 3:
ignore the peak at 7.25 shown
in brown. This is from the
solvent, as explained on p.272.


12 10 8 6
ppm


4 2 0



- It is not enough simply to
measure the relative heights of
the peaks because, as here,
some peaks might be broader
than others. Hence the area
under the peak is measured.


###### Integration tells us the number of hydrogen atoms in each peak

You know from Chapter 3 that the position of a signal in an NMR spectrum tells us about its
environment. In acetic acid the methyl group is next to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl
group and so is slightly deshielded at about δ 2.0 ppm and the acidic proton itself, attached to
O, is very deshielded at δ 11.2 ppm. The same factor that makes this proton acidic—the O–H
bond is polarized towards oxygen—also makes it resonate at low fi eld. So far things are much
the same as in [13]C NMR. Now for a difference. In [1]H NMR the size of the peaks is also important:
the area under the peaks is exactly proportional to the number of protons. Proton spectra are
normally integrated, that is, the area under the peaks is computed and recorded as a line with
steps corresponding to the area, like this.


-----

acetic acid Integral height

= 18 mm

Integral height = 6 mm

12 10 8 6 4 2 0

ppm

Simply measuring the height of the steps with a ruler gives you the ratio of the numbers of
protons represented by each peak. In many spectra this will be measured for you and reported
as a number at the bottom of the spectrum. Knowing the atomic composition (from the mass
spectrum) we also know the distribution of protons of various kinds. Here the heights are
6 mm and 18 mm, a ratio of about 1:3. The compound is C2H4O2 so, since there are four H
atoms altogether, the peaks must contain 1 × H and 3 × H, respectively.
In the spectrum of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene there are just two signals in the ratio of 3:2. This
time the compound is C8H10O2 so the true ratio must be 6:4. The positions of the two signals
are exactly where you would expect them to be from our discussion of the regions of the NMR
spectrum in Chapter 3: the 4H aromatic signal is in the left-hand half of the spectrum, between
5 and 10 ppm, where we expect to see protons attached to sp[2] C atoms, while the 6H signal is
in the right-hand half of the spectrum, where we expect to see protons attached to sp[3] C atoms.

In this next example it is easy to assign the spectrum simply by measuring the steps in the
integral. There are two identical methyl groups (CMe2) with six Hs, one methyl group by itself
with three Hs, the OH proton (1 H), the CH2 group next to the OH (two Hs), and fi nally the
CH2CH2 group between the oxygen atoms in the ring (four Hs).

We will come back to the
regions of the [1]H NMR spectrum in
more detail in just a moment, but
we introduced them in Chapter 3
on p. 60.


-----

Before we go on, a note about the solvent peaks shown in brown in these spectra. Proton
NMR spectra are generally recorded in solution in deuterochloroform (CDCl3)—that is, chloroform (CHCl3) with the [1]H replaced by [2]H (deuterium). The proportionality of the size of the
peak to the number of protons tells you why: if you ran a spectrum in CHCl3, you would see a
vast peak for all the solvent Hs because there would be much more solvent than the compound
you wanted to look at. Using CDCl3 cuts out all extraneous protons. [2]H atoms have different
nuclear properties and so don’t show up in the [1]H spectrum. Nonetheless, CDCl3 is always
unavoidably contaminated with a small amount of CHCl3, giving rise to the small peak at
7.25 ppm. Spectra may equally well be recorded in other deuterated solvents such as water
(D2O), methanol (CD3OD), or benzene (C6D6).

###### Regions of the proton NMR spectrum

All the H atoms in the last example were attached to sp[3] carbons, so you will expect them to
fall between 0 and 5 ppm. However, you can clearly see that H atoms that are nearer to oxygen
are shifted downfi eld within the 0–5 ppm region, to larger δ values (here as far as 3.3 and
3.9 ppm). We can use this fact to build some more detail into our picture of the regions of the

1H NMR spectrum.


H atoms bonded to
unsaturated carbons


H atoms bonded to saturated
carbons (CH, CH2, CH3)


10.5 8.5 6.5 4.5 3.0 0.0 ppm

These regions hold for protons attached to C: protons attached to O or N can come almost
anywhere on the spectrum. Even for C–H signals the regions are approximate and overlap
quite a lot. You should use the chart as a basic guide, and you should aim to learn these
regions. But you will also need to build up a more detailed understanding of the factors affecting proton chemical shift. To help you achieve this understanding, we now need to examine
the classes of proton in more detail and examine the reasons for their particular shifts. It is
important that you grasp these reasons.
In this chapter you will see a lot of numbers—chemical shifts and differences in chemical

shifts. We need these to show that the ideas behind [1]H NMR are securely based in fact. You do

pp. 422–426.

_not need to learn these numbers. Comprehensive tables can be found at the end of Chapter 18,_
which we hope you will fi nd useful for reference while you are solving problems.

###### Protons on saturated carbon atoms

 Chemical shifts are related to the electronegativity of substituents

We shall start with protons on saturated carbon atoms. The top half of the diagram below
shows how the protons in a methyl group are shifted more and more as the atom attached to
them gets more electronegative.

-----

When we are dealing with single atoms as substituents, these effects are straightforward
and more or less additive. If we go on adding electronegative chlorine atoms to a carbon
atom, electron density is progressively removed from it and the carbon nucleus and the
hydrogen atoms attached to it are progressively deshielded. You can see this in the bottom
half of the diagram above. Dichloromethane, CH2Cl2, and chloroform, CHCl3, are commonly
used as solvents and their shifts will become familiar to you if you look at a lot of spectra.

###### Proton chemical shifts tell us about chemistry

The truth is that shifts and electronegativity are not perfectly correlated. The key property is
indeed electron withdrawal but it is the electron-withdrawing power of the whole substituent in
comparison with the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the CH skeleton that matters. Methyl groups
joined to the same element—nitrogen, say—may have very different shifts if the substituent is an
amino group (CH3–NH2 has δH for the CH3 group = 2.41 ppm) or a nitro group (CH3–NO2 has
δH 4.33 ppm). A nitro group is much more electron-withdrawing than an amino group.
What we need is a quick guide rather than some detailed correlations, and the simplest is
this: all functional groups except very electron-withdrawing ones shift methyl groups from
1 ppm (where you fi nd them if they are not attached to a functional group) downfi eld to about
2 ppm. Very electron-withdrawing groups shift methyl groups to about 3 ppm. This is the sort
of thing it is worth learning.

amides (NHCOR), sulfones (SO2R) amines (NHR), sulfides (SR)

alkene, arene, alkyne

Rather than trying to fi t these data to some atomic property, even such a useful one
as electronegativity, we should rather see these shifts as a useful measure of the electronwithdrawing power of the group in question. The NMR spectra are telling us about the chemistry. The largest shift you are likely to see for a methyl group is that caused by the nitro
group, 3.43 ppm, at least twice the size of the shift for a carbonyl group. This gives us our fi rst
hint of some important chemistry: one nitro group is worth two carbonyl groups when it
come to electron-withdrawing power. You have already seen that electron withdrawal and
acidity are related (Chapter 8) and in later chapters you will see that we can correlate the
anion-stabilizing power of groups like carbonyl, nitro, and sulfone with proton NMR.

###### Methyl groups give us information about the structure of molecules

It sounds rather unlikely that the humble methyl group could tell us much that is important
about molecular structure—but just you wait. We shall look at four simple compounds and
their NMR spectra—just the methyl groups, that is.
The fi rst compound, the acid chloride in the margin, shows just one methyl signal containing
nine Hs at δH 1.10. This tells us two things. All the protons in each methyl group are identical,



- You have seen δ used as a
symbol for chemical shift. Now
that we have two sorts of
chemical shift—in the [13]C NMR
spectrum and in the [1]H NMR
spectrum—we need to be able
to distinguish them. δH means
chemical shift in the [1]H NMR
spectrum, and δC is chemical
shift in the [13]C NMR spectrum.

- Rotation about single bonds is
generally very fast (you are about
to see an exception); rotation
about double bonds is generally
very, very slow (it just doesn’t
happen). We talked about
rotation rates in Chapter 12.


and all three methyl groups in the tertiary butyl (t-butyl, or Me3C–) group are identical. This
is because rotation about C–C single bonds, both about the CH3–C bond and about the
(CH3)3C–C bond, is fast. Although at any one instant the hydrogen atoms in one methyl
group, or the methyl groups in the t-butyl group, may differ, on average they are the same. The
time-averaging process is fast rotation about a σ bond.
The second compound shows two 3H signals, one at 1.99 and one at 2.17 ppm. Unlike a C–C
bond, the C=C double bond does not rotate at all and so the two methyl groups are different.
One is on the same side of the alkene as (or ‘cis to’) the –COCl group while the other is on the
opposite side (or ‘trans’).
The next pair of compounds contain the CHO group. One is a simple aldehyde, the other
an amide of formic acid: it is DMF, dimethylformamide. The fi rst has two sorts of methyl
group: a 3H signal at δH 1.81 for the SMe group and a 6H signal at δH 1.35 for the CMe2
group. The two methyl groups in the 6H signal are the same, again because of fast rotation
about a C–C σ bond. The second compound also has two methyl signals, at 2.89 and
2.98 ppm, each 3H, and these are the two methyl groups on nitrogen. Restricted rotation
about the N–CO bond must be making the two Me groups different. You will remember
from Chapter 7 (p. 155) that the N–CO amide bond has considerable double-bond character
because of conjugation: the lone pair electrons on nitrogen are delocalized into the carbonyl group.

Like double bonds, cage structures prevent bond rotation and can make the two protons of
a CH2 group appear different. There are many fl avouring compounds (terpenoids) from herbs
that have structures like this. In the example here—myrtenal, from the myrtle bush—there is
a four-membered ring bridged across a six-membered ring. The methyl groups on the other
bridge are different because one is over the alkene while one is over the CH2. No rotation of
any bonds within the cage is possible, so these methyl groups resonate at different frequencies
(0.74 and 1.33 ppm). The same is true for the two H atoms of the CH2 group.

###### CH and CH2 groups have higher chemical shift than CH3 groups

Electronegative substituents have a similar effect on the protons of CH2 groups and CH
groups, but with the added complication that CH2 groups have two other substituents and CH
groups three. A simple CH2 (methylene) group resonates at 1.3 ppm, about 0.4 ppm further
downfi eld than a comparable CH3 group (0.9 ppm), and a simple CH group resonates at
1.7 ppm, another 0.4 ppm downfi eld. Replacing each hydrogen atom in the CH3 group by a
carbon atom causes a small downfi eld shift as carbon is slightly more electronegative (C 2.5;
H 2.2) than hydrogen and therefore shields less effectively.

The benzyl group (PhCH2–) is very important in organic chemistry. It occurs naturally in
the amino acid phenylalanine, which you met in Chapter 2. Phenylalanine has its CH2 signal
at 3.0 ppm and is moved downfi eld from 1.3 ppm mostly by the benzene ring.
Amino acids are often ‘protected’ as the Cbz (carboxybenzyl) derivatives by reaction with
an acid chloride (we’ll discuss this more in Chapter 23). Here is a simple example together

###### Chemical shifts of CH groups

A CH group in the middle of a carbon skeleton resonates at about 1.7 ppm—another 0.4 ppm
downfi eld from a CH2 group. It can have up to three substituents and these will cause further
downfi eld shifts of about the same amount as we have already seen for CH3 and CH2 groups.
Three examples from nature are nicotine, the methyl ester of lactic acid, and vitamin C. Nicotine,
the compound in tobacco that causes the craving (although not the death, which is doled out
instead by the carbon monoxide and tars in the smoke), has one hydrogen atom trapped between
a simple tertiary amine and an aromatic ring at 3.24 ppm. The ester of lactic acid has a CH proton
at 4.3 ppm. You could estimate this with reasonable accuracy using the guidelines in the two
summary boxes on pp. 273 and 274. Take 1.7 (for the CH) and add 1.0 (for C=O) plus 2.0 (for
OH) = 4.7 ppm—not far out. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has two CHs. One at 4.05 ppm is next to
an OH group (estimate 1.7 + 2.0 for OH = 3.7 ppm) and one is next to a double bond and an oxygen atom at 4.52 ppm (estimate 1.7 + 1 for double bond + 2 for OH = 4.7 ppm). Again, not too bad
for a rough estimate.

An interesting case is the amino acid phenylalanine whose CH2 group we looked at a moment
ago. It also has a CH group between the amino and the carboxylic acid groups. If we record the

1H NMR spectrum in D2O, in either basic (NaOD) or acidic (DCl) solutions, we see a large shift
of that CH group. In basic solution the CH resonates at 3.60 ppm and in acidic solution
it resonates at 4.35 ppm. There is a double effect here: CO2H and NH3+ are both more electronwithdrawing than CO2− and NH2 so both move the CH group downfi eld.



- D2O, NaOD, and DCl have to
be used in place of their [1]H
equivalents to avoid swamping
the spectrum with H2O protons.
All acidic protons are replaced
by deuterium in the process—
more on this later.

The guide above is very rough and ready, but is easily remembered and you should aim to
learn it. However, if you want to, you can make it slightly more accurate by adding further
subdivisions and separating out the very electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, ester OCOR,
fl uoride), which shift by 3 ppm. This gives us the summary chart on this page, which we suggest you use as a reference. If you want even more detailed information, you can refer to the
tables in Chapter 18 or better still the more comprehensive tables in any specialized text (see
the Further reading section).

Answers deduced from this chart won’t be perfect but will give a good guide. Remember—
these shifts are additive. Take a simple example, the ketoester below. There are just three signals
and the integration alone distinguishes the two methyl groups from the CH2 group. One
methyl has been shifted from 0.9 ppm by about 1 ppm, the other by more than 2 ppm. The fi rst
must be next to C=O and the second next to oxygen. More precisely, 2.14 ppm is a shift of
1.24 ppm from our standard value (0.9 ppm) for a methyl group, about what we expect for a
methyl ketone, while 3.61 ppm is a shift of 2.71 ppm, close to the expected 3.0 ppm for an ester
joined through the oxygen atom. The CH2 group is next to an ester and a ketone carbonyl
group and so we expect it at 1.3 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.3 ppm, an accurate estimate, as it happens. We
shall return to these estimates when we look at the spectra of unknown compounds.

###### The alkene region and the benzene region

In [13]C NMR, alkene and benzene carbons came in the same region of the spectrum, but in
the [1]H NMR spectrum the H atoms attached to arene C and alkene C atoms sort themselves
into two groups. To illustrate this point, look at the [13]C and [1]H chemical shifts of cyclo hexene
and benzene, shown in the margin. The two carbon signals are almost the same (1.3 ppm
difference, < 1% of the total 200 ppm scale) but the proton signals are very different (1.6 ppm
difference = 16% of the 10 ppm scale). There must be a fundamental reason for this.

###### The benzene ring current causes large shifts for aromatic protons

A simple alkene has an area of low electron density in the plane of the molecule because the
π orbital has a node there, and the carbons and hydrogen nuclei lying in the plane gain no
shielding from the π electrons.
The benzene ring looks similar at fi rst sight, and the plane of the molecule is indeed a node
for all the π orbitals. However, as we discussed in Chapter 7, benzene is aromatic—it has extra
stability because the six π electrons fi t into three very stable orbitals and are delocalized round
the whole ring. The applied fi eld sets up a ring current in these delocalized electrons that
produces a local fi eld rather like the fi eld produced by the electrons around a nucleus. Inside
the benzene ring the induced fi eld opposes the applied fi eld, but outside the ring it reinforces
the applied fi eld. The carbon atoms are in the ring itself and experience neither effect, but the
hydrogens are outside the ring, feel a stronger applied fi eld, and appear less shielded (i.e. more
deshielded; larger chemical shift).

###### Uneven electron distribution in aromatic rings

The [1]H NMR spectrum of this simple aromatic amine has three peaks in the ratio 1:2:2, which
must correspond to 3H:6H:6H. The 6.38 ppm signal clearly belongs to the protons round the
benzene ring, but why are they at 6.38 and not at around 7.2 ppm? We must also distinguish
the two methyl groups at 2.28 ppm from those at 2.89 ppm. The chart on p. 276 suggests that
these should both be at about 2.4 ppm, close enough to 2.28 ppm but not to 2.89 ppm. The
solution to both these puzzles is the distribution of electrons in the aromatic ring. Nitrogen
feeds electrons into the π system, making it electron rich: the ring protons are more shielded
and the nitrogen atom becomes positively charged and its methyl groups more deshielded.
The peak at 2.89 ppm must belong to the NMe2 group.

Other groups, such as simple alkyl groups, hardly perturb the aromatic system at all and it
is quite common for all fi ve protons in an alkyl benzene to appear as one signal instead of the
three we might expect. Here is an example with some non-aromatic protons too: there is
another on p. 275—the Cbz-protected amino acid.

ppm

The fi ve protons on the aromatic ring all have the same chemical shift. Check that you can
assign the rest. The OCH3 group (green) is typical of a methyl ester (the chart on p. 276 suggests 3.9 ppm). One CH2 group (yellow) is between two carbonyl groups (compare 3.35 ppm
for the similar CH2 group on p. 277). The other (red) is next to an ester and a benzene ring:
we calculate 1.3 + 1.5 + 3.0 = 5.8 ppm for that—reasonably close to the observed 5.19 ppm.
Notice how the Ph and the O together act to shift the Hs attached to this sp[3] C downfi eld into
what we usually expect to be the alkene region. Don’t interpret the regions on p. 272 too
rigidly!

###### How electron donation and withdrawal change chemical shifts

We can get an idea of the effect of electron distribution by looking at a series of benzene rings
with the same substituent in the 1 and 4 positions. This pattern makes all four hydrogens on
the ring identical. Here are a few compounds listed in order of chemical shift: largest shift
(lowest fi eld; most deshielded) fi rst. Conjugation is shown by the usual curly arrows, and
inductive effects by a straight arrow by the side of the group. Only one hydrogen atom and
one set of arrows are shown.


Conjugation, as discussed in
Chapter 7, is felt through π bonds,
while inductive effects are the
result of electron withdrawal or
donation felt simply by polarization
of the σ bonds of the molecule.
See p. 135.

The largest shifts come from groups that withdraw electrons by conjugation. Nitro is the
most powerful—this should not surprise you as we saw the same in non-aromatic compounds
in both [13]C and [1]H NMR spectra. Then come the carbonyl and nitrile group followed by groups
showing simple inductive withdrawal. CF3 is an important example of this kind of group—
three fl uorine atoms combine to exert a powerful effect.


-----

In the middle of our sequence, around the position of benzene itself at 7.27 ppm, come
the halogens, whose inductive electron withdrawal and lone pair donation are nearly
balanced.

Alkyl groups are weak inductive donators, but the groups which give the most shielding—
perhaps surprisingly—are those containing the electronegative atoms O and N. Despite being
inductively electron withdrawing (the C–O and C–N σ bonds are polarized with δ + C), on
balance conjugation of their lone pairs with the ring (as you saw on p. 278) makes them net
electron donors. They increase the shielding at the ring hydrogens. Amino groups are the best.
Note that one nitrogen-based functional group (NO2) is the best electron withdrawer while
another (NH2) is the best electron donor.

As far as the donors with lone pairs are concerned (the halogens plus O and N), two factors
are important—the size of the lone pairs and the electronegativity of the element. If we look
at the four halides at the top of this page the lone pairs are in 2p (F), 3p (Cl), 4p (Br), and 5p (I)
orbitals. In all cases the orbitals on the benzene ring are 2p so the fl uorine orbital is of the
right size to interact well and the others too large. Even though fl uorine is the most electronegative, it is still the best donor. The others don’t pull so much electron density away, but
they can’t give so much back either.
If we compare the fi rst row of the p block elements—F, OH, and NH2—all have lone pairs
in 2p orbitals so now electronegativity is the only variable. As you would expect, the most
electronegative element, F, is now the weakest donor.

###### Electron-rich and electron-defi cient alkenes

The same sort of thing happens with alkenes. We’ll concentrate on cyclohexene so as to make
a good comparison with benzene. The six identical protons of benzene resonate at 7.27 ppm;
the two identical alkene protons of cyclohexene resonate at 5.68 ppm. A conjugating and
electron-withdrawing group such as a ketone removes electrons from the double bond as
expected—but unequally. The proton nearer the C=O group is only slightly downfi eld from
cyclohexene but the more distant one is over 1 ppm downfi eld. The curly arrows show the
electron distribution, which we can deduce from the NMR spectrum.


-----

Oxygen as a conjugating electron donor is even more dramatic. It shifts the proton next to it
downfi eld by the inductive effect but pushes the more distant proton upfi eld a whole 1 ppm by
donating electrons. The separation between the two protons is nearly 2 ppm.
For both types of substituent, the effects are more marked on the more distant (β) proton.
If these shifts refl ect the true electron distribution, we should be able to deduce something
about the chemistry of the following three compounds. You might expect that nucleophiles
will attack the electron-defi cient site in the nitroalkene, while electrophiles will be attacked
by the electron-rich sites in silyl enol ethers and enamines. These are all important reagents
and do indeed react as we predict, as you will see in later chapters. Look at the difference—
there are nearly 3 ppm between the shifts of the same proton on the nitro compound and
the enamine!

###### Structural information from the alkene region

Alkene protons on different carbon atoms can obviously be different if the carbon atoms
themselves are different and we have just seen examples of that. Alkene protons can also be
different if they are on the same carbon atom. All that is necessary is that the substituents at
the other end of the double bond should themselves be different. The silyl enol ether and the
unsaturated ester below both fi t into this category. The protons on the double bond must be
different, because each is _cis to a different group. We may not be able to assign which is_
which, but the difference alone tells us something. The third compound is an interesting
case: the different shifts of the two protons on the ring prove that the N–Cl bond is at an
angle to the C=N bond. If it were in line, the two hydrogens would be identical. The other
side of the C=N bond is occupied by a lone pair and the nitrogen atom is trigonal (sp[2]
hybridized).

###### The aldehyde region: unsaturated carbon bonded to oxygen

The aldehyde proton is unique. It is directly attached to a carbonyl group—one of the most
electron-withdrawing groups that exists—and is very deshielded, resonating with the largest
shifts of any CH protons, in the 9–10 ppm region. The examples below are all compounds that
we have met before. Two are just simple aldehydes—aromatic and aliphatic. The third is the
solvent DMF. Its CHO proton is less deshielded than most—the amide delocalization that feeds
electrons into the carbonyl group provides some extra shielding.

###### Non-aldehyde protons in the aldehyde region: pyridines

Two other types of protons resonate in the region around 9–10 ppm: some aromatic protons
and some protons attached to heteroatoms like OH and NH. We will deal with NH and OH
protons in the next section, but fi rst we must look at some electron-defi cient aromatic rings
with distinctively large shifts.
Protons on double bonds, even very electron-defi cient double bonds like those of nitroalkenes, hardly get into the aldehyde region. However, some benzene rings with very electronwithdrawing groups do manage it because of the extra downfi eld shift of the ring current, so
look out for nitrobenzenes as they may have signals in the 8–9 ppm region.
More important molecules with signals in this region are the aromatic heterocycles such as
pyridine, which you saw functioning as a base in Chapters 8 and 10. The NMR shifts clearly
show that pyridine is aromatic: one proton is at 7.1 ppm, essentially the same as benzene, but
the others are more downfi eld and one, at C2, is in the aldehyde region. This is not because
pyridine is ‘more aromatic’ than benzene but because nitrogen is more electronegative than
carbon. Position C2 is like an aldehyde—a proton attached to sp[2] C bearing a heteroatom—
while C4 is electron defi cient due to conjugation (the electronegative nitrogen is electron withdrawing). Isoquinoline is a pyridine and a benzene ring fused together and has a proton even
further downfi eld at 9.1 ppm—this is an imine proton that experiences the ring current of the
benzene ring.

###### Protons on heteroatoms have more variable shifts than protons on carbon


Protons directly attached to O, N, or S (or any other heteroatom, but these are the most
important) also have signals in the NMR spectrum. We have avoided them so far because
the positions of these signals are less reliable and because they are affected by exchange.

In Chapter 2 you met the antioxidant BHT. Its proton NMR is very simple, consisting of just
four lines with integrals 2, 1, 3, and 18. The chemical shifts of the tert-butyl group (brown),
the methyl group on the benzene ring (orange), and the two identical aromatic protons
(green) should cause you no surprise. What is left, the 1 H signal at 5.0 ppm (pink), must be
the OH. Earlier on in this chapter we saw the spectrum of acetic acid, CH3CO2H, which
showed an OH resonance at 11.2 ppm. Simple alcohols such as tert-butanol have OH signals in
CDCl3 (the usual NMR solvent) at around 2 ppm. Why such big differences?

This is a matter of acidity. The more acidic a proton is—that is, the more easily it can escape
as H[+] (this is the defi nition of acidity from Chapter 8)—the more the OH bond is polarized
towards oxygen. The more the RO–H bond is polarized, the closer we are to free H[+], which
would have no shielding electrons at all, and so the further the proton goes downfi eld. The OH
chemical shifts and the acidity of the OH group are—to a rough extent at least—related.
Thiols (RSH) behave in a similar way to alcohols but are not so deshielded, as you would
expect from the smaller electronegativity of sulfur (phenols are all about 5.0 ppm, PhSH is at
3.41 ppm). Alkane thiols appear at about 2 ppm and arylthiols at about 4 ppm. Amines and
amides show a big variation, as you would expect for the variety of functional groups involved,
and are summarized below. Amides are slightly acidic, as you saw in Chapter 8, and amide
protons resonate at quite low fi elds. Pyrroles are special—the aromaticity of the ring makes
the NH proton unusually acidic—and they appear at about 10 ppm.

Glycine is expected to exist as a zwitterion (Chapter 8, p. 167). It has a 2H signal (green) for

The best clue to why this is so comes from the strange coincidence of the chemical shifts of
the OH, NH, and SH protons in these molecules. They are all the same within experimental
error: 4.90 ppm for glycine, 4.80 ppm for the aminothiol, and 4.84 ppm for EDTA. In fact all
correspond to the same species: HOD, or monodeuterated water. Exchange between XH
(where X=O, N, or S) protons is extremely fast, and the solvent, D2O, supplies a vast excess of
exchangeable deuteriums. These immediately replace all the OH, NH, and SH protons in the
molecules with D, forming HOD in the process. Recall that we do not see signals for deuterium
atoms (that’s why deuterated solvents are used). They have their own spectra at a different
frequency.

The same sort of exchange between OH or NH protons with each other or with traces of
water in the sample means that the OH and NH peaks in most spectra in CDCl3 are rather
broader than the peaks for CH protons.
Two questions remain. First, can we tell whether glycine is a zwitterion in water or not? Not
really: the spectra fi t either or an equilibrium between both—other evidence leads us to
expect the zwitterion in water. Second, why are all four CH2CO groups in EDTA the same?
This we can answer. As well as the equilibrium exchanging the CO2H protons with the solvent, there will be an equally fast equilibrium exchanging protons between CO2D and CO2−.
This makes all four ‘arms’ of EDTA the same.
You should leave this section with an important chemical principle fi rmly established in
your mind.



- **Proton exchange between heteroatoms is fast**
**Proton exchange between heteroatoms, particularly O, N, and S, is a very fast process in comparison**
**with other chemical reactions, and often leads to averaged peaks in the [1]H NMR spectrum.**


We mentioned this fact before
in the context of the mechanism of
addition to a C=O group (p. 136),
and we will continue to explore its
mechanistic consequences
throughout this book.


###### Coupling in the proton NMR spectrum

 Nearby hydrogen nuclei interact and give multiple peaks

So far proton NMR has been not unlike carbon NMR on a smaller scale. However, we have yet
to discuss the real strength of proton NMR, something more important than chemical shifts
and something that allows us to look not just at individual atoms but also at the way the C–H
skeleton is joined together. This is the result of the interaction between nearby protons,
known as coupling.
An example we could have chosen in the last section is the nucleic acid component cytosine, which has exchanging NH2 and NH protons giving a peak for HOD at 4.5 ppm. We didn’t
choose this example because the other two peaks would have puzzled you. Instead of giving
just one line for each proton, they give two lines each—doublets as you will learn to call
them—and it is time to discuss the origin of this ‘coupling’.

- Cytosine is one of the four
bases that, in combination with
deoxyribose and phosphate,
make up DNA. It is a member
of the class of heterocycles
called pyrimidines. We come
back to the chemistry of DNA
towards the end of this book, in
Chapter 42.


-----

You might have expected a spectrum like that of the heterocycle below, which like cytosine is also a pyrimidine. It too has exchanging NH2 protons and two protons on the heterocyclic ring. But these two protons give the expected two lines instead of the four lines in the
cytosine spectrum. It is easy to assign the spectrum: the green proton labelled H[A] is attached
to an aldehyde-like C=N and so comes at lowest fi eld. The red proton labelled H[X] is ortho to
two electron-donating NH2 groups and so comes at high fi eld for an aromatic proton
(p. 272). These protons do not couple with each other because they are too far apart. They
are separated by fi ve bonds whereas the ring protons in cytosine are separated by just three
bonds.

Understanding this phenomenon is so important that we are going to explain it in three
different ways—you choose which appeals to you most. Each method offers a different
insight.
The diaminopyrimidine spectrum you have just seen has two single lines (singlets we shall
call them from now on) because each proton, H[A] or H[X], can be aligned either with or against
the applied magnetic fi eld. The cytosine spectrum is different because each proton, say H[A], is
near enough to experience the small magnetic fi eld of the other proton H[X] as well as the fi eld
of the magnet itself. The diagram shows the result.

If each proton interacted only with the applied fi eld we would get two singlets. But proton H[A] actually experiences two slightly different fi elds: the applied fi eld plus the fi eld of


-----

H[X] or the applied fi eld minus the fi eld of H[X]. H[X] acts either to increase or decrease the fi eld
experienced by H[A]. The position of a resonance depends on the fi eld experienced by the
proton so these two situations give rise to two slightly different peaks—a doublet as we shall
call it. And whatever happens to H[A] happens to H[X] as well, so the spectrum has two doublets, one for each proton. Each couples with the other. The fi eld of a proton is a very small
indeed in comparison with the fi eld of the magnet and the separation between the lines of
a doublet is very small. We shall discuss the size of the coupling later (pp. 294–300).
The second explanation takes into account the energy levels of the nucleus. In Chapter 4,
when we discussed chemical bonds, we imagined electronic energy levels on neighbouring
atoms interacting with each other and splitting to produce new molecular energy levels, some
higher in energy and some lower in energy than the original atomic energy levels. When
hydrogen nuclei are near each other in a molecule, the nuclear energy levels also interact and
split to produce new energy levels. If a single hydrogen nucleus interacts with a magnetic fi eld,
we have the picture on p. 270 of this chapter: there are two energy levels as the nucleus can be
aligned with or against the applied magnetic fi eld, there is one energy jump possible, and
there is a resonance at one frequency. This you have now seen many times and it can be summarized as shown below.

The spectrum of the pyrimidine on p. 286 shows exactly this situation: two protons well
separated in the molecules and each behaving independently. Each has two energy levels,
each gives a singlet, and there are two lines in the spectrum. But in cytosine, whose spectrum
is shown on p. 285, the situation is different: each hydrogen atom has another hydrogen
nucleus nearby and there are now four energy levels. Each nucleus H[A] and H[X] can be aligned
with or against the applied fi eld. There is one (lower) energy level where they are both aligned
with the fi eld and one (higher) level where they are both aligned against. In between there are
two different energy levels in which one nucleus is aligned with the fi eld and one against.
Exciting H from alignment with to alignment against the applied fi eld can be done in two
slightly different ways, shown as A1 and A2 on the diagram. The result is two resonances very
close together in the spectrum.

- Spectrometers in common
use typically have fi eld strengths
of 200–500 MHz.


Please notice carefully that we cannot have this discussion about H[A] without discussing H[X]
in the same way. If there are two slightly different energy jumps to excite H[A], there must also
be two slightly different energy jumps to excite H[X]. A1, A2, X1, and X2 are all different, but the
_difference between A1 and A2 is exactly the same as the difference between X1 and X2. Each_
proton now gives two lines (a doublet) in the NMR spectrum and the splitting of the two doublets is exactly the same. We describe this situation as coupling. We say ‘A and X are coupled’
or ‘X is coupled to A’ (and vice versa, of course). We shall be using this language from now on
and so must you.
Now look back at the spectrum of cytosine at the beginning of this section. You can see the
two doublets, one for each of the protons on the aromatic ring. Each is split by the same
amount (this is easy to check with a ruler). The separation of the lines is the coupling constant
and is called J. In this case J = 4 Hz. Why do we measure J in hertz and not in ppm? We pointed
out on p. 55 (Chapter 3) that we measure chemical shifts in ppm because we get the same number regardless of the rating of the NMR machine in MHz. We measure J in Hz because we also
get the same number regardless of the machine.
The spectra below show [1]H NMR spectra of the same compound run on two different NMR
machines—one a 90 MHz spectrometer and one a 300 MHz spectrometer (these are at the
lower and upper ends of the range of fi eld strengths in common use). Notice that the peaks stay
in the same place on the chemical shift scale (ppm) but the size of the coupling appears to
change because 1 ppm is worth 90 Hz in the top spectrum but 300 Hz in the bottom.

###### Measuring coupling constants in hertz

To measure a coupling constant it is essential to know the rating of the NMR machine in MHz (megahertz). This is why
you are told that each illustrated spectrum is, say, a ‘400 MHz [1]H NMR spectrum’. Couplings may be marked on the
spectrum, electronically, but if not then to measure the coupling, measure the distance between the lines by ruler or
dividers and use the horizontal scale to fi nd out the separation in ppm. The conversion is then easy—to turn parts per
million of megahertz into hertz you just leave out the million! So 1 ppm on a 300 MHz machine is 300 Hz. On a 500 MHz
machine, a 10 Hz coupling is a splitting of 0.02 ppm.


-----

- **Spectra from different machines**

**When you change from one machine to another, say, from a 200 MHz to a 500 MHz NMR machine,**
**chemical shifts (δδ) stay the same in ppm and coupling constants (J ) stay the same in Hz.**


Now for the third way to describe coupling. If you look again at what the spectrum would
be like without interaction between H[A] and H[X] you will see the pattern on the right, with the
chemical shift of each proton clearly obvious.
But you don’t see this because each proton couples with the other and splits its signal by an
equal amount either side of the true chemical shift. The true spectrum has a pair of doublets
each split by an identical amount. Note that no line appears at the true chemical shift, but it
is easy to measure the chemical shift by taking the midpoint of the doublet.
So this spectrum would be described as δH 7.5 (1H, d, J 4 Hz, H[A]) and 5.8 (1H, d, J 4 Hz, H[X]).
The main number gives the chemical shift in ppm and then, in brackets, comes the integration as the number of Hs, the shape of the signal (here ‘d’ for doublet), the size of coupling
constants in Hz, and the assignment, usually related to a diagram. The integration refers to
the combined area under both peaks in the doublet. If the doublet is exactly symmetrical,
each peak integrates to half a proton. The combined signal, however complicated, integrates
to the right number of protons.
We have described these protons as A and X with a purpose in mind. A spectrum of two
equal doublets is called an AX spectrum. A is always the proton you are discussing and X is
another proton with a different chemical shift. The alphabet is used as a ruler: nearby protons
(on the chemical shift scale—not necessarily nearby in the structure!) are called B, C, etc. and
distant ones are called X, Y, etc. You will see the reason for this soon.
If there are more protons involved, the splitting process continues. Here is the NMR spectrum of a famous perfumery compound supposed to have the smell of ‘green leaf lilac’. The
compound is an acetal with fi ve nearly identical aromatic protons at the normal benzene
position (7.2–7.3 ppm) and six protons on two identical OMe groups.

It is the remaining three protons that interest us. They appear as a 2H doublet at 2.9 ppm
and a 1H triplet at 4.6 ppm. In NMR talk, triplet means three equally spaced lines in the ratio
1:2:1. The triplet arises from the three possible states of the two identical protons in the CH2
group.
If one proton H[A] interacts with two protons H[X], it can experience protons H[X] in three different possible states. Both protons H[X] can be aligned with the magnet or both against. These
states will increase or decrease the applied fi eld just as before. But if one proton H[X] is aligned
with and one against the applied fi eld, there is no net change to the fi eld experienced by H[A].
There are two arrangements for this (see diagram overleaf). We’ll therefore see a signal of
double intensity for H[A] at the correct chemical shift, one signal at higher fi eld and one at lower
fi eld. In other words, a 1:2:1 triplet.

We could look at this result by our other methods too. There is one way in which both nuclei
can be aligned with and one way in which both can be aligned against the applied fi eld, but
two ways in which they can be aligned one with and one against. Proton H[A] interacts with
each of these states. The result is a 1:2:1 triplet.

If there are more protons involved, we continue to get more complex systems, but the intensities can all be deduced simply from Pascal’s triangle, which gives the coeffi cients in a binomial expansion. If you are unfamiliar with this simple device, here it is.

Put ‘1’ at the top and then add
an extra number in each line by
adding together the numbers on
either side of the new number in
the line above. If there is no
number on one side, that counts
as a zero, so the lines always
begin and end with ‘1’.


You can read off from the triangle what pattern you may expect when a proton is coupled
to n equivalent neighbours. There are always n + 1 peaks with the intensities shown by the
triangle. So far, you’ve seen 1:1 doublets (line 2 of the triangle) from coupling to 1 proton, and
1:2:1 triplets (line 3) from coupling to 2. You will often meet ethyl groups (CH3CH2X), where
the CH2 group couples to three identical protons and appears as a 1:3:3:1 quartet and the
methyl group as a 1:2:1 triplet. In isopropyl groups, (CH3)2CHX, the methyl groups appear as
a 6H doublet and the CH group as a septuplet.
Here is a simple example: the four-membered cyclic ether oxetane. Its NMR spectrum has a
4H triplet for the two identical CH2 groups next to oxygen and a 2H quintet for the CH2 in the
middle. Each proton H[X] ‘sees’ four identical neighbours (H[A]) and is split equally by them all
to give a 1:4:6:4:1 quintet. Each proton H[A] ‘sees’ two identical neighbours H[X] and is split into
a 1:2:1 triplet. The combined integral of all the lines in the quintet together is 2 and of all the
lines in the triplet is 4.

- **Identical protons do**
###### not couple with themselves

Remember, the coupling comes
only from the neighbouring
protons: it doesn’t matter how
many protons form the signal
itself (2 for H[X], 4 for H[A])—it’s
how many are next door (4 next
to H[X], 2 next to H[A]) that
matters. The protons in each
CH2 group are identical and
cannot couple with each other.
It’s what you see that counts
not what you are.

A slightly more complicated example is the diethyl acetal below. It has a simple AX pair of
doublets for the two protons on the ‘backbone’ (red and green) and a typical ethyl group (2H
quartet and 3H triplet). An ethyl group is attached to only one substituent through its CH2
group, so the chemical shift of that CH2 group tells us what it is joined to. Here the peak at
3.76 ppm can only be an OEt group. There are, of course, two identical CH2 groups in this
molecule.

In all of these molecules, a proton may have had several neighbours, but all those neighbours have been the same. And therefore all the coupling constants have been the same. What
happens when coupling constants differ? Chrysanthemic acid, the structural core of the
insecticides produced by pyrethrum fl owers, gives an example of the simplest situation—
where a proton has two different neighbours.

Chrysanthemic acid has a carboxylic acid, an alkene, and two methyl groups on the threemembered ring. Proton H[A] has two neighbours, H[X] and H[M]. The coupling constant to H[X] is
8 Hz, and that to H[M] is 5.5 Hz. We can construct the splitting pattern as shown on the right.
The result is four lines of equal intensity called a double doublet (or sometimes a doublet
**of doublets), abbreviation dd. The smaller coupling constant can be read off from the separa-**
tion between lines 1 and 2 or between lines 3 and 4, while the larger coupling constant is
between lines 1 and 3 or between lines 2 and 4. The separation between the middle two lines
is not a coupling constant. You could view a double doublet as an imperfect triplet where the
second coupling is too small to bring the central lines together: alternatively, look at a triplet
as a special case of a double doublet where the two couplings are identical and the two middle
lines coincide.

###### Coupling is a through-bond effect

Do neighbouring nuclei interact through space or through the electrons in the bonds? We
know that coupling is in fact a ‘through-bond effect’ because of the way coupling constants
vary with the shape of the molecule. The most important case occurs when the protons are at
either end of a double bond. If the two hydrogens are cis, the coupling constant J is typically
about 10 Hz, but if they are trans, J is much larger, usually 15–18 Hz. These two chloro acids
are good examples.

If coupling were through space, the nearer cis hydrogens would have the larger J. In fact,
coupling occurs through the bonds and the more perfect parallel alignment of the bonds in the
_trans compound provides better communication and a larger J._
Coupling is at least as helpful as chemical shift in assigning spectra. When we said (p. 280)
that the protons on cyclohexenone had the chemical shifts shown, how did we know? It was
coupling that told us the answer. The proton next to the carbonyl group (H[2] in the diagram)
has one neighbour (H[3]) and appears as a doublet with J = 11 Hz, just right for a proton on a
double bond with a cis neighbour. The proton H[3] itself appears as a double triplet. Inside each
triplet the separation of the lines is 4 Hz and the two triplets are 11 Hz apart.

As coupling gets more and more complicated it can be hard to interpret the results, but if you
_know what you are looking for things do become easier. Here is the example of heptan-2-one. The_
green protons next to the carbonyl group are a 2H triplet (coupled to the two red protons) with J
7 Hz. The red protons themselves are next to four protons, and although these four protons are
not identical the coupling constants are about the same: the red protons therefore appear as a 2H
quintet, with a coupling constant also of 7 Hz. The brown signal is more complicated: we might
call it a ‘4H multiplet’ but in fact we know what it must be: the signals for the four brown protons
on carbons 5 and 6 overlap, and must be made up of a 2H quintet (protons on C5) and a 2H sextet
(protons on C6). We can see the coupling of the protons on C6 with the terminal methyl group
because the methyl group (orange) is a 3H triplet (also with a 7 Hz coupling constant).

###### Coupling constants depend on three factors

The coupling constants in cyclohexenone were different, but all the coupling constants in
heptanone are about the same—around 7 Hz. Why?



- **Factors affecting coupling constants**

**•** **Through-bond distance between the protons.**

**•** **Angle between the two C–H bonds.**

**•** **Electronegative substituents.**


-----

The coupling constants we have seen so far have all been between hydrogen atoms on
neighbouring carbon atoms—in other words, the coupling is through three bonds (H–C–
C–H) and is designated [3]JHH. These coupling constants [3]JHH are usually about 7 Hz in an openchain, freely rotating system such as we have in heptanone. The C–H bonds vary little in
length but in cyclohexenone the C–C bond is a double bond, signifi cantly shorter than a
single bond. Couplings ([3]JHH) across double bonds are usually larger than 7 Hz (11 Hz in
cyclohexenone). [3]JHH couplings are called vicinal couplings because the protons concerned are
on neighbouring carbon atoms.
Something else is different too: in an open-chain system we have a time average of all rotational conformations (we will look at this in the next chapter). But across a double bond there
is no rotation and the angle between the two C–H bonds is fi xed: they are always in the same
plane. In the plane of the alkene, the C–H bonds are either at 60° (cis) or 180° (trans) to each
other. Coupling constants in benzene rings are slightly less than those across _cis alkenes_
because the bond is longer (bond order 1.5 rather than 2).

In naphthalenes, there are unequal bond lengths around the two rings. The bond
between the two rings is the shortest, and the lengths of the others are shown. Coupling 142 pm
across the shorter bond (8 Hz) is signifi cantly stronger than coupling across the longer 137 pm
bond (6.5 Hz). 140 pm
The effect of the third factor, electronegativity, is easily seen in the comparison between

ordinary alkenes and alkenes with alkoxy substituents, known as enol ethers. We are going to naphthalene

pling is larger than the cis, as you would now expect. But if you compare the two pairs, the

###### Long-range coupling

When the through-bond distance gets longer than three bonds, coupling is not usually seen.
To put it another way, four-bond coupling [4]JHH is usually zero. However, it is seen in some
special cases, the most important being meta coupling in aromatic rings and allylic coupling
in alkenes. In both, the orbitals between the two hydrogen atoms can line up in a zig-zag

fashion to maximize interaction. This arrangement looks rather like a letter ‘W’ and this sort
of coupling is called W-coupling. Even with this advantage, values of [4]JHH are usually small,
about 1–3 Hz.
_Meta coupling is very common when there is ortho coupling as well, but here is an exam-_
ple where there is no ortho coupling because none of the aromatic protons have immediate
neighbours—the only coupling is meta coupling. There are two identical H[A]s, which have

has two identical meta neighbours and so appears as a 1H triplet. The coupling is small
(J ~ 2.5 Hz).

We have already seen a molecule with allylic coupling. We discussed in some detail why
cyclohexenone has a double triplet for H[3]. But it also has a less obvious double triplet for H[2].
The triplet coupling is less obvious since J is small (about 2 Hz) because it is [4]JHH—allylic coupling to the CH2 group at C4. Here is a diagram of the coupling, which you would be able to
spot in an expansion of the cyclohexenone spectrum on p. 293.

###### Coupling between similar protons

Identical protons do not couple with each other. The three protons in a methyl group may
couple to some other protons, but _never couple with each other. They are an A3 system._
Identical neighbours do not couple either. Turn back to p. 271 and you’ll see that even though
each of the four protons on the para-disubstituted benzenes has one neighbour, they appear
as one singlet because every proton is identical to its neighbour.
We have also seen how two different protons forming an AX system give two separate doublets. Now we need to see what happens to protons in between these two extremes. What
happens to two similar neighbours? As two protons get closer and closer together, do the two
doublets you see in the AX system suddenly collapse to the singlet of the A2 system? You
have probably guessed that they do not. The transition is gradual. Suppose we have two different neighbours on an aromatic ring. The spectra below show what we see. These are all
1,4-disubstituted benzene rings with different groups at the 1 and 4 positions.

You’ll notice that when the two doublets are far apart, as in the fi rst spectrum, they look like
normal doublets. But as they get closer together the doublets get more and more distorted,
until fi nally they are identical and collapse to a 4H singlet.

The critical factor in the shape of the peak is how the difference between the chemical shifts
of the two protons (Δδ) compares with the size of the coupling constant (J) for the machine in
question. If Δδ is much larger than J there is no distortion: if, say, Δδ is 2 ppm at 500 MHz
(= 1000 Hz) and the coupling constant is a normal 7 Hz, then this condition is fulfi lled and we
have an AX spectrum of two 1:1 doublets. As Δδ approaches J in size, so the inner lines of the
two doublets increase and the outer lines decrease until, when Δδ is zero, the outer lines vanish away altogether and we are left with the two superimposed inner lines—a singlet or an A2
spectrum. You can see this progression in the diagram on the right.

- You may see this situation
described as an ‘AB quartet’. It
isn’t! A quartet is an exactly
equally spaced 1:3:3:1 system
arising from coupling to three
identical protons, and you
should avoid this misleading
usage.


We call the last stages, where the distortion is great but the protons are still different, an AB
spectrum because you cannot really talk about H[A] without also talking about H[B]. The two
inner lines may be closer than the gap between the doublets or the four lines may all be
equally spaced. Two versions of an AB spectrum are shown in the diagram—there are many
more variations.
It is a generally useful tip that a distorted doublet ‘points’ towards the protons with which
it is coupled.

Or, to put it another way, the AB system is ‘roofed’ with the usual arrangement of low
walls and a high middle to the roof. Look out for doublets (or any other coupled signals) of
this kind.
We shall end this section with a fi nal example illustrating para-disubstituted benzenes and
roofi ng as well as an ABX system and an isopropyl group. The aromatic ring protons form a
pair of distorted doublets (2H each), showing that the compound is a para-disubstituted benzene. Then the alkene protons form the AB part of an ABX spectrum. They are coupled to each
other with a large (trans) J = 16 Hz and one is also coupled to another distant proton. The large
doublets are distorted (AB) but the small doublets within the right-hand half of the AB system
are equal in height. The distant proton X is part of an i-Pr group and is coupled to H[B] and the
six identical methyl protons. Both Js are nearly the same so it is split by seven protons and is
an octuplet. It looks like a sextuplet because the intensity ratios of the lines in an octuplet
would be 1:7:21:35:35:21:7:1 (from Pascal’s triangle) and it is hardly surprising that the outside
lines disappear.

###### Coupling can occur between protons on the same carbon atom

We have seen cases where protons on the same carbon atom are different: compounds with
an alkene unsubstituted at one end. If these protons are different (and they are certainly near
to each other), then they should couple. They do, but in this case the coupling constant is
usually very small. Here is the spectrum of an example you met on p. 281.

The small 1.4 Hz coupling is a [2]JHH coupling between two protons on the same carbon that
are different because there is no rotation about the double bond. [2]JHH coupling is called gemi_nal coupling._
This means that a monosubstituted alkene (a vinyl group) will have characteristic signals for
each of the three protons on the double bond. Here is the example of ethyl acrylate (ethyl
propenoate, a monomer for the formation of acrylic polymers). The spectrum looks rather
complex at fi rst, but it is easy to sort out using the coupling constants.

The largest J (16 Hz) is obviously between the orange and green protons (trans coupling), the
medium J (10 Hz) is between the orange and red (cis coupling), and the small J (4 Hz) must be
between the red and green (geminal). This assigns all the protons: red, 5.60 ppm; green,
6.40 ppm; orange, 6.11 ppm Assignments based on coupling are more reliable than those
based on chemical shift alone.

Ethyl vinyl ether is a reagent used for the protection of alcohols. All its coupling constants
are smaller than is usual for an alkene because of the electronegativity of the oxygen atom,
which is now joined directly to the double bond. It is still a simple matter to assign the protons
of the vinyl group because couplings of 13, 7, and 2 Hz must be trans, cis, and geminal, respectively. In addition, the orange H is on a carbon atom next to oxygen and so goes downfi eld
while the red and green protons have extra shielding from the conjugation of the oxygen lone
pairs (see p. 281).

Geminal coupling on saturated carbons can be seen only if the hydrogens of a CH2 group
are different. The bridging CH2 group of myrtenal (p. 274) provides an example. The coupling
constant for the protons on the bridge, JAB, is 9 Hz. Geminal coupling constants in a saturated
system can be much larger (typically 10–16 Hz) than in an unsaturated one.

###### To conclude

You have now met, in Chapter 3 and this chapter, all of the most important spectroscopic
techniques available for working out the structure of organic molecules. We hope you can
now appreciate why proton NMR is by far the most powerful of these techniques, and we hope
you will be referring back to this chapter as you read the rest of the book. We shall talk about
proton NMR a lot, and specifi cally we will come back to it in detail in Chapter 18, where we
will look at using all of the spectroscopic techniques in combination, and in Chapter 31, when
we look at what NMR can tell us about the shape of molecules.

###### Some compounds can exist as a pair of mirror-image forms

How many products are formed in this reaction? Well, the straightforward answer is one—
there’s only one aldehyde, only one cyanide ion, and only one reasonable way in which they
can react. But this analysis is not quite correct. One point that we ignored when we fi rst talked
about this reaction, because it was irrelevant at that time, is that the carbonyl group of the
aldehyde has two faces. The cyanide ion could attack either from the front face or the back
face, giving, in each case, a distinct product.

As we explained in Chapter 6 (pp. 125–7), the cyanide attacks the π* orbital of the aldehyde
more or less at right angles to the plane of the molecule as it forms a new bond with the old
p orbital on C. This translates into ‘front’ and ‘back’ on a diagram on paper. Compare the diagram on the left with the others to make sure this is clear.
Are these two products different? If we lay them side by side and try to arrange them so that
they look identical, we fi nd that we can’t—you can verify this by making models of the two
structures. The structures are non-superimposable—so they are not identical. In fact, they are
mirror images of each other: if we refl ected one of the structures, A, in a mirror, we would get
a structure that is identical with B.

We call two structures that are not identical but are mirror images of each other (like these
two) enantiomers. Structures that are not superimposable on their mirror image, and can
therefore exist as two enantiomers, are called chiral. In this reaction, the cyanide ions are just
as likely to attack the ‘front’ face of the aldehyde as they are the ‘back’ face, so we get a 50:50
mixture of the two enantiomers.



- In reading this chapter, you
will have to do a lot of mental
manipulation of threedimensional shapes. Because we
can represent these shapes in
the book only in two
dimensions, we suggest that you
make models, using a molecular
model kit, of the molecules we
talk about. With some practice,
you will be able to imagine the
molecules you see on the page
in three dimensions.

Make sure that you are clear about this: C and D are identical molecules, while A and B are
mirror images of each other. Refl ection in a mirror makes no difference to C or D; they are
superimposable on their own mirror images and therefore cannot exist as two enantiomers.
Structures that are superimposable on their mirror images are called achiral.

###### Chiral molecules have no plane of symmetry

What is the essential difference between these two compounds that means one is superimposable on its mirror image and one is not? The answer is _symmetry. Acetone cyano-_
hydrin has a plane of symmetry running through the molecule. This plane cuts the central
carbon and the OH and CN groups in half, and has one methyl group on each side. All
planar molecules (such as our simple aldehyde) cannot be chiral as the plane of the molecule must be a plane of symmetry. Cyclic molecules may have a plane of symmetry passing
through two atoms of the ring, as in the cyclohexanone below. The plane passes through
both atoms of the carbonyl group and bisects the methyl group as well as the hydrogen
atom (not shown) on the same carbon atom. The bicyclic acetal looks more complicated but
a plane of symmetry passes between the two oxygen atoms and the two ring-junction
carbon atoms while bisecting the two methyl groups. None of these molecules is chiral.

On the other hand, the aldehyde cyanohydrin has no plane of symmetry: the plane of the
paper has OH on one side and CN on the other while the plane at right angles to the paper has
H on one side and RCH2 on the other. This compound has no plane of symmetry (has asym_metry) and has two enantiomers._

- Later in this chapter we shall
meet a much less important type
of symmetry that also means
molecules are not chiral if they
possess it. This is a centre of
symmetry.



- **Planes of symmetry and chirality**

**•** **Any structure that has no plane of symmetry is chiral and can exist as two mirror-image**
**forms (enantiomers).**

**•** **Any structure with a plane of symmetry is not chiral and cannot exist as two enantiomers.**


By ‘structure’, we don’t just mean chemical structure: the same rules apply to everyday objects.
Some examples from among more familiar objects in the world around us should help make
these ideas clear. Look around you and fi nd a chiral object—a pair of scissors, a screw (but not the
screwdriver), a car, and anything with writing on it, like this page. Look again for achiral objects
with planes of symmetry—a plain mug, saucepan, chair, most simple manufactured objects
without writing on them. The most signifi cant chiral object near you is the hand you write with.


-----

###### Gloves, hands, and socks

Most gloves exist in pairs of non-identical mirror-image forms: only a left glove fi ts a left hand and only a right glove fi ts
a right hand. This property of gloves and of the hands inside them gives us the word ‘chiral’—cheir is Greek for ‘hand’.
Hands and gloves are chiral; they have no plane of symmetry, and a left glove is not superimposable on its mirror image
(a right glove). Feet are chiral too, as are shoes. But socks (usually!) are not. Although we all sometimes have problems
fi nding two socks of a matching colour, once you’ve found them, you never have to worry about which sock goes on which
foot because socks are achiral. A pair of socks is manufactured as two identical objects, each of which has a mirror plane.
The ancient Egyptians had less care for the chirality of hands and their paintings often show people, even Pharaohs,
with two left hands or two right hands—they just didn’t seem to notice.

###### Tennis racquets and golf clubs

If you are left-handed and want to play golf, you either have to play in a right-handed manner or get hold of a set of
left-handed golf clubs. Golf clubs are clearly therefore chiral; they can exist as either of two enantiomers. You can tell this
just by looking at a golf club. It has no plane of symmetry, so it must be chiral. But left-handed tennis players have no
problem using the same racquets as right-handed tennis players and tennis players of either chirality sometimes swap
the racquet from hand to hand. Look at a tennis racquet: it has a plane of symmetry (indeed, usually two), so it’s achiral.
It can’t exist as two mirror-image forms.


-----

- These statements are slightly
incomplete but will serve you
well in almost all situations: we
will come to centres of symmetry
shortly (p. 321).



- **To summarize**

**•** **A structure with a plane of symmetry is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image and**
**cannot exist as two enantiomers.**

**•** **A structure without a plane of symmetry is chiral and not superimposable on its mirror**
**image and can exist as two enantiomers.**


###### Stereogenic centres

Back to chemistry, and the product from the reaction of an aldehyde with cyanide. We
explained above that this compound, being chiral, can exist as two enantiomers. Enantiomers
are clearly isomers; they consist of the same parts joined together in a different way. In particular, enantiomers are a type of isomer called stereoisomers because the isomers differ not
in the connectivity of the atoms, but only in the overall shape of the molecule.

**they are stereoisomers. Enantiomers are stereoisomers, and so**
**are E and Z double bonds. We shall meet other types of**

**the two isomers is different, they are constitutional isomers. If** **stereoisomers shortly.**

_connectivity) differs_ stereoisomers: the atoms have the same connectivity, but are arranged differently

We should also introduce you briefl y to another pair of concepts here, which you will meet
again in more detail in Chapter 16: confi guration and conformation. Two stereoisomers really
are different molecules: they cannot be interconverted without breaking a bond somewhere.
We therefore say that they have different confi gurations. But any molecule can exist in a
number of conformations: two conformations differ only in the temporary way the molecule
happens to arrange itself, and can easily be interconverted just by rotating around bonds.
Humans all have the same confi guration: two arms joined to the shoulders. We may have different conformations: arms folded, arms raised, pointing, waving, etc.

 - **Confi guration and conformation**

**•** **Changing the confi guration of a molecule always means that bonds are broken.**

**•** **A different confi guration is a different molecule.**

**•** **Changing the conformation of a molecule means rotating about bonds, but not breaking them.**

**•** **Conformations of a molecule are readily interconvertible, and are all the same molecule.**

The aldehyde cyanohydrin is chiral because it does not have a plane of symmetry. In fact, it
_cannot have a plane of symmetry because it contains a tetrahedral carbon atom carrying four_
different groups: OH, CN, RCH2, and H. Such a carbon atom is known as a stereogenic or
**chiral** **centre. The product of cyanide and acetone is not chiral; it has a plane of symmetry**
and no chiral centre because two of the groups on the central carbon atom are the same.

- **If a molecule contains one carbon atom carrying four different groups it will not have a plane**

**stereogenic or chiral centre.**



- You will see shortly that
compounds with more than one
chiral centre are not always
chiral.


We saw how the two enantiomers of the aldehyde cyanohydrin arose by attack of cyanide
on the two faces of the carbonyl group of the aldehyde. We said that there was nothing to
favour one face over the other, so the enantiomers must be formed in equal quantities. A mixture of equal quantities of a pair of enantiomers is called a racemic mixture.

**are chiral they will be formed as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.**


Here are some more reactions you have come across that make chiral products from achiral
starting materials. In each case, the principle must hold—equal amounts of the two enantiomers (racemic mixtures) are formed.

###### Many chiral molecules are present in nature as single enantiomers

Let’s turn to some simple, but chiral, molecules—the natural amino acids. All amino acids
have a carbon carrying an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and the R group,
which varies from amino acid to amino acid. So unless R�H (this is the case for glycine),
amino acids always contain a chiral centre and lack a plane of symmetry.

It is possible to make amino acids quite straightforwardly in the laboratory. The scheme

Alanine made in this way must be racemic because the starting material and all reagents are
achiral. However, if we isolate alanine from a natural source—by hydrolysing vegetable protein, for example—we fi nd that this is not the case. Natural alanine is solely one enantiomer,
the one drawn in the margin. Samples of chiral compounds that contain only one enantiomer
are called enantiomerically pure. We know that ‘natural’ alanine contains only this enantiomer from X-ray crystal structures.


###### Enantiomeric alanine

In fact, nature does sometimes (but very rarely) use the other enantiomer of alanine, for example in the construction of
bacterial cell walls. Some antibiotics (such as vancomycin) owe their selectivity to the way they can recognize these
‘unnatural’ alanine components and destroy the cell wall that contains them.


###### Chiral and enantiomerically pure

Before we go further, we should just mention one common point of confusion. Any compound whose molecules do not have a plane of symmetry is chiral. Any sample of a chiral
compound that contains molecules all of the same enantiomer is enantiomerically pure. All
alanine is chiral (the structure has no plane of symmetry) but laboratory-produced alanine is
racemic (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers) whereas naturally isolated alanine is enantiomerically pure.



- **‘Chiral’ does not mean ‘enantiomerically pure’.**



- Remember—we use the
word confi guration to describe
the arrangement of bonds
around an atom. Confi gurations
cannot be changed without
breaking bonds.

- These priority rules are also
used to assign E and Z to
alkenes, and are sometimes
called the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog
(CIP) rules, after their devisors.
You can alternatively use atomic
weights—for isotopes you have
to (D has a higher priority
than H)—apart from in the
vanishingly rare case of a chiral
centre bearing Te and I (look at
the data in the periodic table at
the front of this book to see why).


Most of the molecules we fi nd in nature are chiral—a complicated molecule is much more
likely not to have a plane of symmetry than to have one. Nearly all of these chiral molecules
in living systems are found not as racemic mixtures, but as single enantiomers. This fact has
profound implications, for example in the chemistry of drug design, and we will come back
to it later.

###### R and S can be used to describe the confi guration of a chiral centre

Before going on to talk about single enantiomers of chiral molecules in more detail, we need
to explain how chemists describe which enantiomer they’re talking about. We can, of course,
just draw a diagram, showing which groups go into the plane of the paper and which groups
come out of the plane of the paper. This is best for complicated molecules. Alternatively, we
can use the following set of rules to assign a letter, R or S, to describe the confi guration of
groups at a chiral centre in the molecule.
Here again is the enantiomer of alanine you get if you extract alanine from living things.

**1.** Assign a priority number (1–4) to each substituent at the chiral centre. Atoms with
higher atomic numbers get higher priority.

Alanine’s chiral centre carries one N atom (atomic number 7), two C atoms (atomic
number 6), and one H atom (atomic number 1). So, we assign priority 1 to the NH2
group, because N has the highest atomic number. Priorities 2 and 3 will be assigned to
the CO2H and the CH3 groups, and priority 4 to the hydrogen atom; but we need a
way of deciding which of CO2H and CH3 takes priority over the other. If two (or more)
of the atoms attached to the chiral centre are identical, then we assign priorities to
these two by assessing the atoms attached to those atoms. In this case, one of the
carbon atoms carries oxygen atoms (atomic number 8) and one carries only hydrogen
atoms (atomic number 1). So CO2H is higher priority that CH3; in other words, CO2H
gets priority 2 and CH3 priority 3.

**2.** Arrange the molecule so that the lowest priority substituent is pointing away from
you. In our example, naturally extracted alanine, H is priority 4, so we need to look at
the molecule with the H atom pointing into the paper, like this.


4 **H** **NH2** 1 points into the paperrotate so that H

-----

**3.** Mentally move from substituent priority 1 to 2 to 3. If you are moving in a clockwise
manner, assign the label R to the chiral centre; if you are moving in an anticlockwise
manner, assign the label S to the chiral centre.

A good way of visualizing this is to imagine turning a steering wheel in the direction of the
numbering. If you are turning your car to the right, you have R; if you are turning to the left
you have S. For our molecule of natural alanine, if we move from NH2 (1) to CO2H (2) to CH3
(3) we’re going anticlockwise (turning to the left), so we call this enantiomer (S)-alanine.
You can try working the other way, from the confi gurational label to the structure. Take
lactic acid as an example. Lactic acid is produced by bacterial action on milk; it’s also produced in your muscles when they have to work with an insuffi cient supply of oxygen, such as
during bursts of vigorous exercise. Lactic acid produced by fermentation is often racemic,
although certain species of bacteria produce solely (R)-lactic acid. On the other hand, lactic
acid produced by anaerobic respiration in muscles has the S confi guration.
As a brief exercise, try drawing the three-dimensional structure of (R)-lactic acid. You may
fi nd this easier if you draw both enantiomers fi rst and then assign a label to each.
You should have drawn:

(R)-lactic acid (R)-lactic acid

Remember that, if we had made lactic acid in the laboratory from simple achiral starting
materials, we would have got a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-lactic acid. Reactions in living
systems can produce enantiomerically pure compounds because they make use of enzymes,
themselves enantiomerically pure compounds of (S)-amino acids.

###### Is there a chemical difference between two enantiomers?

The short answer is no.* Take (S)-alanine (in other words, alanine extracted from plants) and
(R)-alanine (the enantiomer found in bacterial cell walls) as examples. They have identical
NMR spectra, identical IR spectra, and identical physical properties with a single important
exception. If you shine plane-polarized light through a solution of (S)-alanine, you will fi nd
that the light is rotated to the right. A solution of (R)-alanine rotates plane-polarized light to
the left and by the same amount. Racemic alanine doesn’t rotate such light at all.

###### The rotation of plane-polarized light is known as optical activity

Observation of the rotation of plane-polarized light is known as polarimetry; it is a straightforward way of fi nding out if a sample is racemic or if it contains more of one enantiomer than
the other. Polarimetric measurements are carried out in a polarimeter, which has a singlewavelength (monochromatic) light source with a plane-polarizing fi lter, a sample holder,
where a cell containing a solution of the substance under examination can be placed, and a
detector with a read-out that indicates by how much the light is rotated. Rotation to the right
is given a positive value, rotation to the left a negative one.

- Note that the units of a
measured optical rotation α are
degrees, but, by convention,
specifi c rotation [α] is quoted
without units.



- [α]D values can be used as a
guide to the enantiomeric purity
of a sample, in other words, to
how much of each enantiomer it
contains. We will come back to
this in Chapter 41.


The angle through which a sample of a compound (usually a solution) rotates plane-polarized
light depends on a number of factors, the most important ones being the path length (how far
the light has to pass through the solution), concentration, temperature, solvent, and wavelength. Typically, optical rotations are measured at 20 °C in a solvent such as ethanol or
chloro form, and the light used is from a sodium lamp, with a wavelength of 589 nm.
The observed angle through which the light is rotated is given the symbol α. By dividing this
value by the path length ℓ (in dm) and the concentration c (in g cm[−][3]) we get a value, [α], which
is specifi c to the compound in question. Indeed, [α] is known as the compound’s specifi c rota**tion. The choice of units is eccentric and arbitrary but is universal so we must live with it.**

###### α
 [ ]α = cℓ

Most [α] values are quoted as [α]D (where the D indicates the wavelength of 589 nm, the ‘D
line’ of a sodium lamp) or [ ]α D20, the 20 indicating 20 °C. These defi ne the remaining variables.
Here is an example. A simple acid, known as mandelic acid, can be obtained from almonds
in an enantiomerically pure form. When 28 mg was dissolved in 1 cm[3] of ethanol and the
solution placed in a 10-cm-long polarimeter cell, an optical rotation α of –4.35° was measured
(that is, 4.35° to the left) at 20 °C with light of wavelength 589 nm. What is the specifi c rotation of the acid?
First, we need to convert the concentration to grammes per cubic centimetre: 28 mg in
1 cm[3] is the same as 0.028 g cm[−][3]. The path length of 10 cm is 1 dm, so

[ ]α 20D = _cαℓ_ = 0.028−4.35× 1 = −155.4

###### Enantiomers can be described as (++) or (–)

We can use the fact that two enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions
to assign each a label that doesn’t depend on knowing its confi guration. We call the
enantiomer that rotates plane-polarized light to the right (gives a positive rotation) the
(+)-enantiomer (or the _dextrorotatory enantiomer) and the enantiomer that rotates plane-_
polarized light to the left (gives a negative rotation) the (–)-enantiomer (or the laevorotatory
enantiomer). The direction in which light is rotated is not dependent on whether a stereogenic centre is R or S. An (R) compound is equally as likely to be (+) as (–)—of course, if it is
(+) then its (S) enantiomer must be (–). The enantiomer of mandelic acid we have just discussed, for example, is (R)-(–)-mandelic acid because its specifi c rotation is negative, and
(S)-alanine happens to be (S)-(+)-alanine. The labels (+) and (–) were more useful before the
days of X-ray crystallo graphy, when chemists did not know the actual confi guration of the
molecules they studied, and could distinguish two enantiomers only by the signs of their
specifi c rotations.

###### Enantiomers can be described as D or L

Long before the appearance of X-ray crystallography as an analytical tool, chemists had to
discover the detailed structure and stereochemistry of molecules by a complex series of degradations. A molecule was gradually broken down into its constituents, and from the products
that were formed the overall structure of the starting molecule was deduced. As far as stereochemistry was concerned, it was possible to measure the specifi c rotation of a compound, but
not to determine its confi guration. However, by using series of degradations it was possible to
tell whether certain compounds had the same or opposite confi gurations.
Glyceraldehyde is one of the simplest chiral compounds in nature. Because of this, chemists
took it as the standard against which the confi gurations of other compounds could be compared. The two enantiomers of glyceraldehyde were given the labels D (for dextro—because it
was the (+)-enantiomer) and L (for laevo—because it was the (–)-enantiomer). Any enantiomerically pure compound that could be related, by a series of chemical degradations and
transformations, to D-(+)-glyceraldehyde was labelled D, and any compound that could be


**OH**


**HO**


**CHO**


D-(+)-glyceraldehyde


-----

related to L-(–)-glyceraldehyde was labelled L. The processes concerned were slow and laborious (the scheme below shows how (–)-lactic acid was shown to be D-(–)-lactic acid) and are
never used today. D and L are now used only for certain well-known natural molecules, where
their use is established by tradition, for example, the L-amino acids or the D-sugars. These
labels, D and L, are in small capital letters.



- **Remember that the R/S, ++/–, and D/L nomenclatures all arise from different observations and**
**the fact that a molecule has, say, the R confi guration gives no clue as to whether it will**
**have + or – optical activity or be labelled D or L. Never try and label a molecule as D/L or +/–**
**simply by working it out from the structure. Likewise, never try and predict whether a molecule**
**will have a + or – specifi c rotation by looking at the structure.**


###### Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not enantiomers

Two enantiomers are chemically identical because they are mirror images of one another.
Other types of stereoisomers may be chemically (and physically) quite different. These two
alkenes, for example, are geometrical isomers (or cis–trans isomers). Their physical chemical
properties are different, as you would expect, since they are quite different in shape. Neither
is chiral of course as they are planar molecules.

A similar type of stereoisomerism can exist in cyclic compounds. In one of these, 4-t-butylcyclohexanols, the two substituents are on the same side of the ring; in the other, they are on
opposite sides of the ring. Again, the two compounds have chemical and physical properties
that are quite different.

Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are called diastereoisomers. Both of
these pairs of isomers fall into this category. Notice how the physical and chemical properties
of a pair of diastereoisomers differ.



- Notice that we do not
always write in all the hydrogen
atoms. If the t-butyl group is
forward, as in these diagrams,
the hydrogen atom must be
back.



- **The physical and chemical properties of enantiomers are identical; the physical and chemical**
**properties of diastereoisomers differ. ‘Diastereoisomer’ is sometimes shortened to ‘diastereomer’.**


-----

###### Diastereoisomers can be chiral or achiral

This pair of epoxides was produced by chemists in Pennsylvania in the course of research on
drugs intended to alleviate the symptoms of asthma. Clearly, they are again diastereoisomers,
and again they have different properties. Although the reaction they were using to make these
compounds gave some of each diastereoisomer, the chemists working on these compounds
only wanted to use the fi rst (trans) epoxide. They were able to separate it from its cis diastereoisomer by chromatography because the diastereoisomers differ in polarity.

through the molecule.

If a compound is chiral, it can exist as two enantiomers. We’ve just drawn the two enantiomers of each of the diastereoisomers of our epoxide. This set of four structures contains two
diastereoisomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images). These are the two different chemical compounds, the cis and trans epoxides, that have different properties. Each can exist as
two enantiomers (stereoisomers that are mirror images) indistinguishable except for rotation.
We have two pairs of diastereoisomers, each being a pair of enantiomers. When you are considering the stereochemistry of a compound, always distinguish the diastereoisomers fi rst
and then split these into enantiomers if they are chiral.

-----

In fact, the chemists working on these compounds wanted only one enantiomer of the
_trans epoxide—the top left stereoisomer. They were able to separate the trans epoxide from_
the _cis epoxide by chromatography because they are diastereoisomers. However, because_
they had made both diastereoisomers in the laboratory from achiral starting materials, both
diastereoisomers were racemic mixtures of the two enantiomers. Separating the top enantiomer of the trans epoxide from the bottom one was much harder because enantiomers have
identical physical and chemical properties. To get just the enantiomer they wanted the
chemists had to develop some completely different chemistry, using enantiomerically pure
compounds derived from nature.

###### Absolute and relative stereochemistry

When we talk about two chiral diastereoisomers, we have no choice but to draw the structure
of one enantiomer of each diastereoisomer because we need to include the stereochemical
information to distinguish them, even if we’re talking about a racemic mixture of the two
enantiomers. To avoid confusion, it’s best to write something defi nite under the structure, such
as ‘ ± ’ (meaning racemic) under a structure if it means ‘this diastereoisomer’ but not ‘this enantiomer of this diastereoisomer’. So in this case we should say that the chemists were able to
separate these two diastereoisomers, but wanted only one enantiomer of the trans diastereoisomer and that this could not be separated by physical means.

When the stereochemistry drawn on a molecule means ‘this diastereoisomer’, we say that we
are representing relative stereochemistry; when it means ‘this enantiomer of this diastereoisomer’ we say we are representing its absolute stereochemistry. Relative stereochemistry tells
us only how the stereogenic centres within a molecule relate to each other.

###### Diastereoisomers can arise when structures have more than one stereogenic centre

Let’s analyse our set of four stereoisomers a little more closely. You may have already noticed
that these structures all contain stereogenic centres—two in each case. Go back to the diagram of the four structures at the bottom of p. 312 and, without looking at the structures
overleaf, assign an R or S label to each of the stereogenic centres.
You should have made assignments of R and S like this.


You need to know, and be able
to use, the rules for assigning
R and S; they were explained on
p. 308. If you get any of the
assignments wrong, make sure you
understand why.

- **Converting enantiomers and diastereoisomers**

**•** **To go from one enantiomer to another, both stereogenic centres are inverted.**

**•** **To go from one diastereoisomer to another, only one of the two is inverted.**



- If you are asked to explain
some stereochemical point in an
examination, choose a cyclic
example—it makes it much
easier.


All the compounds that we have talked about so far have been cyclic because the diastereoisomers are easy to visualize: two diastereoisomers can be identifi ed because the substituents
are either on the same side or on opposite sides of the ring (cis or trans). But acyclic compounds
can exist as diastereoisomers too. Take these two, for example. Both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are members of the amphetamine class of stimulants, which act by imitating the
action of the hormone adrenaline.


**NHMe**

**OH**

adrenaline

**HO**


Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are stereoisomers that are clearly not mirror images of
each other—only one of the two stereogenic centres in ephedrine is inverted in pseudoephedrine—so they must be diastereoisomers. Thinking in terms of stereogenic centres is useful
because, just as this compound has two stereogenic centres and can exist as two diastereoisomers, any compound with more than one stereogenic centre can exist in more than one
diastereoisomeric form.
Both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are produced in enantiomerically pure form by
plants, so, unlike the anti-asthma intermediates above, in this case we are talking about single
enantiomers of single diastereoisomers. Adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) is also chiral.
In nature it is a single enantiomer but it cannot exist as other diastereoisomers as it has only
one stereogenic centre.

We can illustrate the combination of two stereogenic centres in a compound by considering what happens when you shake hands with someone. Hand-shaking is successful only
if you each use the same hand! By convention, this is your right hand, but it’s equally possible to shake left hands. The overall pattern of interaction between two right hands and
two left hands is the same: a right-handshake and a left-handshake are enantiomers of one
another; they differ only in being mirror images. If, however, you misguidedly try to shake
your right hand with someone else’s left hand you end up holding hands. Held hands consist of one left and one right hand; a pair of held hands have totally different interactions
from a pair of shaking hands; we can say that holding hands is a diastereoisomer of shaking
hands. We can summarize the situation when we have two hands, or two chiral centres,
each one R or S.

What about compounds with more than two stereogenic centres? The family of sugars provides lots of examples. Ribose is a fi ve-carbon sugar that contains three stereogenic centres.
The enantiomer shown here is the one used in the metabolism of all living things and, by
convention, is known as D-ribose. The three stereogenic centres of D-ribose have the R confi guration. For convenience, we will consider ribose in its open-chain form, but more usually
it would be cyclic, as shown underneath.


-----

In theory we can work out how many ‘stereoisomers’ there are of a compound with three
stereogenic centres simply by noting that there are 8 (= 2[3]) ways of arranging Rs and Ss.

_RRR_ _RRS_ _RSR_ _RSS_

_SSS_ _SSR_ _SRS_ _SRR_

But this method blurs the all-important distinction between diastereoisomers and enantiomers. In each case, the combination in the top row and the combination directly below it are
enantiomers (all three centres are inverted); the four columns are diastereoisomers. Three
stereogenic centres therefore give four diastereoisomers, each a pair of two enantiomers.
Going back to the example of the C5 aldoses, each of these diastereoisomers is a different
sugar. In these diagrams each diasteroisomer is in a frame but the top line shows one enantiomer (D) and the bottom line the other (L).

of symmetrical molecules we are
about to describe.


You’ve probably recognized that there’s a simple mathematical relationship between the
number of stereogenic centres and the number of stereoisomers a structure can have. Usually,
a structure with n stereogenic centres can exist as 2[n] stereoisomers. These stereoisomers consist of 2[n][−][1] diastereoisomers, each of which has a pair of enantiomers.


-----

###### Why only usually?—achiral compounds with more than one stereogenic centre

Sometimes, symmetry in a molecule can cause some stereoisomers to be degenerate, or
‘cancel out’—there aren’t as many stereoisomers as you’d _expect. Take tartaric acid, for_
example. This stereoisomer of tartaric acid is found in grapes, and its salt, potassium hydrogen tartrate, can precipitate out as crystals at the bottom of bottles of wine. It has two
stereogenic centres, so you’d expect 2[2] = 4 stereoisomers; two diastereoisomers, each a pair
of enantiomers.

(1R,2S)-Tartaric acid and (1S,2R)-tartaric acid are not enantiomers, but they are identical
because, even though they contain stereogenic centres, they are achiral. By drawing (1R,2S)tartaric acid after a 180° rotation about the central bond, you can easily see that it has a mirror
plane, and so must be achiral. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, and R is the mirror
image of S, the R,S diastereoisomer cannot be chiral.



- These two structures are the
same molecule drawn in two
different conformations—to get
from one to the other just rotate
half of the molecule about the
central bond.

- **Compounds that contain stereogenic centres but are themselves achiral are called meso**
**compounds. This means that there is a plane of symmetry with R stereochemistry on one side**
**and S stereochemistry on the other.**


So tartaric acid can exist as two diastereoisomers, one with two enantiomers and the other
achiral (a meso compound). It’s worth noting that the formula stating that a compound with
_n stereogenic centres has 2[n][−][1] diastereoisomers has worked but not the formula that states_
there are 2[n] ‘stereoisomers’. In general, it’s safer not to count up total ‘stereoisomers’ but to
work out fi rst how many diastereoisomers there are, and then to decide whether or not each
one is chiral, and therefore whether or not it has a pair of enantiomers.


###### Meso hand-shaking

We can extend our analogy between hand-shaking and diastereoisomers to meso compounds as well. Imagine a pair of
identical twins shaking hands. They could be shaking their left hands or their right hands and there would be a way to tell
the two handshakes apart because they are enantiomers. But if the twins hold hands, you will not be able to distinguish
left holds right from right holds left, because the twins themselves are indistinguishable—this is the meso hand-hold!

Look out for meso diastereoisomers in compounds that have a degree of symmetry in their overall structure. Inositol, one
of whose diastereoisomers is an important growth factor, has six stereogenic centres. It’s a challenge to work out how
many diastereosiomers it has—in fact all but one of them are meso.

###### Investigating the stereochemistry of a compound

When you want to describe the stereochemistry of a compound our advice is to identify the
diastereoisomers and then think about whether they are chiral or not. Don’t just count up
‘stereoisomers’—to say that a compound with two stereogenic centres has four ‘stereoisomers’
is rather like saying that ‘four hands are getting married’. Two people are getting married,
each with two hands.
Let’s work through how you might think about the stereochemistry of a simple example,
the linear triol 2,3,4-trihydroxypentane or pentane-2,3,4-triol.
This is what you should do.


**OH**

**OH**


**1.** Draw the compound with the carbon skeleton in the usual zigzag fashion running across the page, 1.

**2.** Identify the chiral centres, 2.

**3. Decide how many diastereoisomers there are by putting the**
substituents at those centres up or down. It often helps to give
each diastereoisomer a ‘tag’ name. In this case there are three
diastereoisomers. The three OH groups can be all on the same
side or else one of the end OHs or the middle one can be on the
opposite side to the rest. We can call the fi rst syn,syn because the
two pairs of chiral centres (1 & 2, and 2 & 3) groups are both
arranged with the OHs on the same side of the molecule (syn).

**4. By checking on possible planes of symmetry, see which**
diastereoisomers are chiral. In this case only the plane down
the centre can be a plane of symmetry.

**5.  Draw the enantiomers of any chiral diastereoisomer by inverting**
_all the stereogenic centres. This can easily be achieved by_
refl ecting the molecule in the plane of the paper, as if it were a
mirror. Everything that was ‘up’ is now ‘down’ and vice versa.

**6.** Announce the conclusion. You could have said that there are four
‘stereoisomers’ but the following statement is much more helpful.
There are three diastereoisomers, the syn,syn, the syn,anti, and the
_anti,anti. The syn,syn and the anti,anti are achiral (meso)_
compounds but the syn,anti is chiral and has two enantiomers.

###### Chiral compounds with no stereogenic centres

A few compounds are chiral, yet have no stereogenic centres. Try making a model of the allene
in the margin. It has no stereogenic centre, but these mirror images are not superimposable and
so the allene is chiral: the structures shown are enantiomers. Similarly, some biaryl compounds,
such as the important bisphosphine below, known as BINAP, exist as two separate enantiomers
because rotation about the green bond is restricted. If you were to look at this molecule straight
down along the green bond, you would see that the two fl at rings are at right angles to each
other and so the molecule has a twist in it rather like the 90° twist in the allene. Compounds
that are chiral because of restricted rotation about a single bond are called atropisomers (from
the Greek for ‘won’t turn’).

These two examples rely on the rigidity of π systems but this simple saturated system is also
chiral. These two rings have to be orthogonal because of the tetrahedral nature of the central
carbon atom. There is no chiral centre, but there is no plane of symmetry. Cyclic compounds
like this with rings joined at a single C atom are called spiro compounds. Spiro compounds are
often chiral even when at a fi rst glance they look quite symmetrical, and you should look particularly carefully for planes of symmetry when you think about their stereochemistry.

###### Axes and centres of symmetry

The fact that the three compounds we have just introduced (along with Feist’s acid in
the box on p. 319) were chiral might have surprised you, because at fi rst glance they do
look quite ‘symmetrical’. In fact, they do all have an element of symmetry, and it is only

**2**

one which is compatible with chirality: an axis of symmetry. If a molecule can be rotated

**2** through 180° about an axis to give exactly the same structure then it has twofold axial

symmetry, or C2 symmetry. Compounds with an axis of symmetry will still be chiral,
provided they lack either a plane or a centre of symmetry.
_C2 symmetry is common in many more everyday molecules than the ones in the last_
section. Below is an example of a compound with two diastereoisomers. One (we call
it the syn diastereoisomer here—the two phenyl rings are on the same side) has a plane
of symmetry—it must be achiral (and as it nonetheless has chiral centres we can also call it
the meso diastereoisomer). The other has some degree of symmetry, but it has axial symmetry and can therefore be chiral. The C2 axis of symmetry is shown in orange. Rotating 180°
gives back the same structure, but refl ecting in a mirror plane (brown) gives a nonsuperimpos able mirror image.

going to introduce a second type of symmetry that is not compatible with chirality. If a molecule has a centre of symmetry it is not chiral. We will now explain how to spot a centre of
symmetry.
The diamide skeleton in the margin has a plane of symmetry in the plane of the page and
also a plane of symmetry at right angles to that plane passing through the two saturated carbon atoms (represented by the green dotted line). If we add substituents R to this structure we
can have two diastereoisomers with the two R groups on the same side (syn) of the fl at ring or
on opposite (anti) sides. Although the plane of the paper is no longer a plane of symmetry,
neither isomer is chiral as the other plane bisects the substituents and is still a plane of symmetry. So far nothing new.

there are again two diastereoisomers, syn and anti. But their symmetry properties are different. The syn isomer is chiral but the anti isomer is not.

###### Separating enantiomers is called resolution

Early in this chapter we said that most of the molecules in Nature are chiral, and that Nature
usually produces these molecules as single enantiomers. We’ve talked about the amino acids,
the sugars, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and tartaric acid—all compounds that can be isolated from natural sources as single enantiomers. On the other hand, in the laboratory, if we
make chiral compounds from achiral starting materials we are doomed to get racemic mixtures. So how do chemists ever isolate compounds as single enantiomers, other than by
extracting them from natural sources? We’ll consider this question in much more detail in
Chapter 41, but here we will look at the simplest way: using Nature’s enantiomerically pure
compounds to help us separate the components of a racemic mixture into its two enantiomers.
This process is called resolution. Imagine the reaction between a chiral, but racemic, alcohol
and a chiral, but racemic, carboxylic acid, to give an ester in an ordinary acid-catalysed esterifi cation (Chapter 10).

they should be easy to separate, for example by chromatography.

A separation of two enantiomers is called a resolution. Resolutions can be carried out only
if we make use of a component that is already enantiomerically pure: it is very useful that
Nature provides us with such compounds; resolutions nearly always make use of compounds
derived from nature.


###### Natural chirality

Why Nature uses only one enantiomer of most important biochemicals is an easier question to answer than how this
asymmetry came about in the fi rst place, or why L-amino acids and D-sugars were the favoured enantiomers, since, for
example, proteins made out of racemic samples of amino acids would be complicated by the possibility of enormous
numbers of diastereomers. Some have suggested that life arose on the surface of single chiral quartz crystals, which
provided the asymmetric environment needed to make life’s molecules enantiomerically pure. Or perhaps the asymmetry
present in the spin of electrons released as gamma rays acted as a source of molecular asymmetry. Given that enantiomerically pure living systems should be simpler than racemic ones, maybe it was just chance that the L-amino acids and
the D-sugars won out.


**H2N** **CO2H**


Now for a real example. Chemists studying the role of amino acids in brain function needed
to obtain each of the two enantiomers of the amino acid in the margin. They made a racemic
sample using the Strecker synthesis of amino acids that you met in Chapter 11. The racemic
amino acid was treated with acetic anhydride to make the mixed anhydride and then with the
sodium salt of naturally derived, enantiomerically pure alcohol menthol to give two diastereoisomers of the ester.
One of the diastereoisomers turned out to be more crystalline (that is, to have a higher melting point) than the other and, by allowing the mixture to crystallize, the chemists were able
to isolate a pure sample of this diastereoisomer. Evaporating the diastereoisomer left in solution (the ‘mother liquors’) gave them the less crystalline diastereoisomer.


**MeO**

Next the esters were hydrolysed by boiling them in aqueous KOH. The acids obtained were
enantiomers, as shown by their (nearly) opposite optical rotations and similar melting
points. Finally, a more vigorous hydrolysis of the amides (boiling for 40 hours with 20%
NaOH) gave them the amino acids they required for their biological studies (see bottom of
p. 322).

###### Resolutions using diastereoisomeric salts

The key point about resolution is that we must bring together two stereogenic centres in
such a way that there is a degree of interaction between them: separable diastereoisomers
are created from inseparable enantiomers. In the last two examples, the stereogenic centres
were brought together in covalent compounds, esters. Ionic compounds will do just as
well—in fact, they are often better because it is easier to recover the compound after the
resolution.


-----

An important example is the resolution of the enantiomers of naproxen. Naproxen is a
member of a family of compounds known as non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
which are 2-aryl propionic acids. This class also includes ibuprofen, the painkiller developed
by Boots and marketed as Nurofen.

(S)-naproxen ibuprofen 2-arylpropionic acids

Both naproxen and ibuprofen are chiral but, while both enantiomers of ibuprofen are effective painkillers, and the drug is sold as a racemic mixture (and anyway racemizes in the body)
only the (S) enantiomer of naproxen has anti-infl ammatory activity. When the American
pharmaceutical company Syntex fi rst marketed the drug they needed a way of resolving the
racemic naproxen they synthesized in the laboratory.
Since naproxen is a carboxylic acid, they chose to make the carboxylate salt of an enantiomerically pure amine, and found that the most effective was a glucose derivative. Crystals were
formed, which consisted of the salt of the amine and (S)-naproxen, the salt of the amine with
(R)-naproxen (the diastereoisomer of the crystalline salt) being more soluble and so remaining
in solution. These crystals were fi ltered off and treated with base, releasing the amine (which
can later be recovered and reused) and allowing the (S)-naproxen to crystallize as its sodium
salt. This is an unusual resolving agent as a simpler amine might usually be preferred. However,
it makes the point that many resolving agents may have to be tried before one is found that
works.

###### Chiral drugs

You may consider it strange that it was necessary to market naproxen as a single enantiomer, in view of what we
have said about enantiomers having identical properties. The two enantiomers of naproxen do indeed have identical
properties in the laboratory, but once they are inside a living system they, and any other chiral molecules, are differentiated by interactions with the enantiomerically pure molecules they fi nd there. An analogy is that of a pair of
gloves—the gloves weigh the same, are made of the same material, and have the same colour—in these respects
they are identical. But interact them with a chiral environment, such as a hand, and they become differentiable
because only one fi ts.

###### Resolutions can be carried out by chromatography on chiral materials

Interactions even weaker than ionic bonds can be used to separate enantiomers. Chromatographic separation relies on a difference in affi nity between a stationary phase (often silica) and
a mobile phase (the solvent travelling through the stationary phase, known as the eluent)
mediated by, for example, hydrogen bonds or van der Waals interactions. If the stationary
phase is made chiral by bonding it with an enantiomerically pure compound (often a derivative of an amino acid), chromatography can be used to separate enantiomers.

Chromatography on a chiral stationary phase is especially important when the compounds
being resolved have no functional groups suitable for making the derivatives (usually esters or

activities.

In order to study these compounds further, it was necessary to obtain them in enantiomerically pure form. This was done by passing a solution of the racemic compound through a
column of silica bonded to an amino-acid-derived chiral stationary phase. The (R)-(–)enantiomer showed a lower affi nity for the stationary phase and therefore was eluted from the
column fi rst, followed by the (S)-(+)-enantiomer.

Two enantiomers of one molecule may be the same compound, but they are clearly different, although only in a limited number of situations. They can interact with biological systems differently, for example, and can form salts or compounds with different properties
when reacted with a single enantiomer of another compound. In essence, enantiomers behave
identically except when they are placed in a chiral environment. In Chapter 41 we will see how
to use this fact to make single enantiomers of chiral compounds, but next we move on to three
classes of reactions in which stereochemistry plays a key role: substitutions, eliminations, and
additions.

###### Mechanisms for nucleophilic substitution

Substitution is the replacement of one group by another. You met such reactions in Chapter
10, and an example is shown in the margin. This reaction is a substitution because the Cl
group is replaced by the NH2 group. You learnt to call the molecule of ammonia (NH3) the
**nucleophile and the chloride you called the leaving group. In Chapter 10, the substitution**
reactions always took place at the trigonal (sp[2]) carbon atom of a carbonyl group.
In this chapter we shall be looking at reactions such as the second reaction in the margin.
These are substitution reactions, because the Cl group is replaced by the PhS group. But the
CH2 group at which the reaction takes place is a tetrahedral (sp[3]), or saturated, carbon atom,
rather than a C=O group. This reaction and the one above may look superfi cially the same but
they are quite different in mechanism. The requirements of good reagents are also different
in substitutions at carbonyl groups and at saturated carbon—that’s why we changed the
nucleophile from NH3 to PhS[−]: ammonia would not give a good yield of PhCH2NH2 in the
second reaction.
Let’s have a look at why the mechanisms of the two substitutions must be different. Here’s
a summary of the mechanism of the fi rst reaction.

In the fi rst step the nucleophile attacks the C=O π bond. It’s immediately obvious that the
fi rst step is no longer possible at a saturated carbon atom. The electrons cannot be added to a
π bond as the CH2 group is fully saturated. In fact there is no way for the nucleophile to add
before the leaving group departs (as it did in the reaction above) because this would give an
impossible fi ve-valent carbon atom.
Instead, two new and different mechanisms become possible. Either the leaving group goes
fi rst and the nucleophile comes in later, or the two events happen at the same time. The fi rst
of these possibilities you will learn to call the **SN1 mechanism. The second mechanism,**
which shows how the neutral carbon atom can accept electrons provided it loses some at the
same time, you will learn to call the SN2 mechanism. You will see later that both mechanisms
are possible with this molecule, benzyl chloride.

###### Why is it important to know about the two mechanisms for substitution?

If we know which mechanism a compound reacts by, we know what sort of conditions to use to get good yields in
substitutions. For example, if you look at a commonly used nucleophilic substitution, the replacement of OH by Br, you’ll
fi nd that two quite different reaction conditions are used depending on the structure of the alcohol. Tertiary alcohols
react rapidly with HBr to give tertiary alkyl bromides. Primary alcohols, on the other hand, react only very slowly with HBr
and are usually converted to primary alkyl bromides with PBr3. The reason is that the fi rst example is an SN1 reaction
while the second is an SN2 reaction: by the end of this chapter you will have a clear picture of how to predict which
mechanism will apply and how to choose appropriate reaction conditions.

###### Kinetic evidence for the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms

Before we go any further we are going to look in a bit more detail at these two mechanisms
because they allow us to explain and predict many aspects of substitution reactions. The evidence that convinced chemists that there are two different mechanisms for substitution at
saturated carbon is kinetic: it relates to the rate of reactions such as the displacement of bromide by hydroxide, as shown in the margin.
It was discovered, chiefl y by Hughes and Ingold in the 1930s, that some nucleophilic substitutions are fi rst order (that is, the rate depends only on the concentration of the alkyl halide

Edward David Hughes (1906–63)
and Sir Christopher Ingold
(1893–1970) worked at
University College, London in
the 1930s. They fi rst thought of
many of the mechanistic ideas
that chemists now take for
granted.



- There is more about the
relationship between reaction
rates and mechanisms in
Chapter 12. Quantities in square
brackets represent concentrations
and the proportionality constant

and does not depend on the concentration of the nucleophile), while others are second order
(the rate depends on the concentrations of both the alkyl halide and the nucleophile). How
can we explain this result? In what we called the ‘SN2 mechanism’ on p. 329 there is just one
step. Here’s the one-step SN2 mechanism for substitution of n-butyl bromide by hydroxide:

**HO**

**+  Br**
**Br** **OH**

With only one step, that step must be the rate-determining step. The rate of the overall
reaction depends only on the rate of this step, and kinetic theory tells us that the rate of a
reaction is proportional to the concentrations of the reacting species:

rate of reaction = k[n-BuBr][HO[−]]

If this mechanism is right, then the rate of the reaction will be simply and linearly proportional to both [n-BuBr] and [HO[−]]. And it is. Ingold measured the rates of reactions like these
and found that they were proportional to the concentration of each reactant—in other words
they were second order. He called this mechanism Substitution, Nucleophilic, 2nd order; SN2
for short. The rate equation is usually given like this, with k2 representing the second-order
rate constant.

rate = k2[n-BuBr][HO[−]]

###### Signifi cance of the SN2 rate equation

This equation is useful for two reasons. Firstly, it gives us a test for the SN2 mechanism. Let’s
illustrate this with another example: the reaction between NaSMe (an ionic solid—the nucleophile will be the anion MeS[−]) and MeI to give Me2S, dimethyl sulfi de.

SN2 ?

**MeS** **Me** **I** **MeS** **Me** **+  I**

To study the rate equation, fi rst, we keep the concentration of NaSMe constant and in a
series of experiments vary that of MeI and see what happens to the rate. Then in another set
of experiments we keep the concentration of MeI constant and vary that of MeSNa and see
what happened to the rate. If the reaction is indeed SN2 we should get a linear relationship in
both cases: the graphs in the margin show a typical set of results.
The fi rst graph tells us that the rate is proportional to [MeI], that is, rate = _ka[MeI] and the_
second graph that it is proportional to [MeSNa], that is, rate = _kb[MeSNa]. But why are the_
slopes different? If you look at the rate equation for the reaction, you will see that we have
incorporated a constant concentration of one of the reagents into what appears to be the rate
constant for the reaction. The true rate equation is

rate = k2[MeSNa][MeI]

If [MeSNa] is constant, the equation becomes

rate = _ka[MeI], where ka_ = _k2[MeSNa]_

If [MeI] is constant, the equation becomes

rate = _kb[MeSNa], where kb_ = _k2[MeI]_

If you examine the graphs you will see that the slopes are different because

slope 1 = _ka_ = _k2[MeSNa], but slope 2_ = _kb_ = _k2[MeI]_

We can easily measure the true rate constant k2 from these slopes because we know the constant values for [MeSNa] in the fi rst experiment and for [MeI] in the second. The value of k2

from both experiments should be the same. The mechanism for this reaction is indeed SN2:
the nucleophile MeS[−] attacks as the leaving group I[−] leaves.
The second reason that the SN2 rate equation is useful is that it confi rms that the performance of an SN2 reaction depends both on the nucleophile and on the carbon electrophile.
We can therefore make a reaction go better (speed it up or improve its yield) by changing
either. For example, if we want to displace I[−] from MeI using an oxygen nucleophile we might
consider using any of those in the table below.

Oxygen nucleophiles in the SN2 reaction

Oxygen nucleophile pKa of conjugate acid Rate in SN2 reaction

HO[–] 15.7 (H2O) fast

RCO2[–] about 5 (RCO2H) moderate

H2O –1.7 (H3O[+]) slow

RSO2O[–] 0 (RSO2OH) slow


The same reasons that made hydroxide ion basic (chiefl y that it is unstable as an anion and
therefore reactive) make it a good nucleophile. Basicity can be viewed as nucleophilicity
towards a proton, and nucleophilicity towards carbon must be related. So if we want a fast
reaction, we should use NaOH rather than, say, Na2SO4 to provide the nucleophile. Even at the
same concentration, the rate constant k2 with HO[−] as the nucleophile is much greater than the
_k2 with SO4− as the nucleophile._
But that is not our only option. The reactivity and hence the structure of the carbon electrophile matter too. If we want reaction at a methyl group we can’t change the carbon skeleton, but we can change the leaving group. The table below shows what happens if we use the
various methyl halides in reaction with NaOH. The best choice for a fast reaction (greatest
value of k2) will be to use MeI and NaOH to give methanol.



- We shall discuss
nucleophilicity and leaving
group ability in more detail
later.


You saw in Chapter 10 that
nucleophilicity towards the carbonyl group is closely related to
basicity. The same is not quite so
true for nucleophilic attack on
the saturated carbon atom, as we
shall see, but there is a relationship nonetheless.

###### Signifi cance of the SN1 rate equation

If we replace the substitution of n-butyl bromide with a substitution of t-butyl bromide, we get
the reaction shown in the margin. It turns out that, kinetically, this reaction is fi rst order: its
rate depends only on the concentration of tert-BuBr—it doesn’t matter how much hydroxide
you add: the rate equation is simply

The reason for this is that the reaction happens in two steps: fi rst the bromide leaves, to
generate a carbocation, and only then does the hydroxide ion move in to attack, forming the
alcohol.

slow fast
**OH**

**Br** **OH**

stage 1: formation of the carbocation stage 2: reaction of the carbocation

In the SN1 mechanism, the formation of the cation is the rate-determining step. This makes
good sense: a carbocation is an unstable species and so it will be formed slowly from a stable
neutral organic molecule. But once formed, being very reactive, all its reactions will be fast,
regardless of the nucleophile. The rate of disappearance of t-BuBr is therefore simply the rate of
the slow fi rst step: the hydroxide nucleophile is not involved in this step and therefore does not
appear in the rate equation and hence cannot affect the rate. If this is not clear to you, think of a
crowd of people trying to leave a railway station or a football match through some turnstiles. It
doesn’t matter how fast they walk, run, or are driven away in taxis afterwards, it is only the rate
of struggling through the turnstiles that determines how fast the station or stadium empties.
Once again, this rate equation is useful because we can determine whether a reaction is SN1
or SN2. We can plot the same graphs as we plotted before. If the reaction is SN2, the graphs look
like those we have just seen. But if it is SN1, the graphs in the margin show what happens when
we vary [t-BuBr] at constant [NaOH] and then vary [NaOH] at constant [t-BuBr].
The slope of the fi rst graph is simply the fi rst-order rate constant because rate = _k1[t-BuBr]._
But the slope of the second graph is zero. The rate-determining step does not involve NaOH so
adding more of it does not speed up the reaction. The reaction shows fi rst-order kinetics (the
rate is proportional to one concentration only) and the mechanism is called SN1, that is,
Substitution, Nucleophilic, 1st order.
This observation is very signifi cant. The fact that the nucleophile does not appear in the rate
equation means that not only does its concentration not matter—its reactivity doesn’t matter
either! We are wasting our time opening a tub of NaOH to add to this reaction—water will do
just as well. All the oxygen nucleophiles in the table above react at the same rate with t-BuBr
although they react at very different rates with MeI. Indeed, SN1 substitution reactions are
generally best done with weaker, non-basic nucleophiles to avoid the competing elimination
reactions discussed in Chapter 17.



- **The rate of an SN1 reaction depends on:**

**•** **the carbon skeleton**

**•** **the leaving group**

**along with the usual factors of temperature and solvent.**

**But NOT the nucleophile.**


###### How can we decide which mechanism (SN1 or SN2) will apply to a given organic compound?

So, substitution reactions at saturated C go via one of two alternative mechanisms, each with
a very different dependence on the nature of the nucleophile. It’s important to be able to
predict which mechanism is likely to apply to any reaction, and rather than doing the kinetic
experiments to fi nd out, we can give you a few simple pointers to predict which will operate


-----

in which case. The factors that affect the mechanism of the reaction also help to explain why
that mechanism operates.
The most important factor is the structure of the carbon skeleton. A helpful generalization is that compounds that can form relatively stable carbocations generally do so and react
by the SN1 mechanism, while the others have no choice but to react by the SN2 mechanism.
As you will see in a moment, the most stable carbocations are the ones that have the most
substituents, so the more carbon substituents at the reaction centre, the more likely the compound is to react by the SN1 mechanism.
As it happens, the structural factors that make cations stable usually also lead to slower SN2
reactions. Heavily substituted compounds are good in SN1 reactions, but bad in an SN2 reaction because the nucleophile would have to squeeze its way into the reaction centre past the
substituents. It is better for an SN2 reaction if there are only hydrogen atoms at the reaction
centre—methyl groups react fastest by the SN2 mechanism. The effects of the simplest structural variations are summarized in the table below (where R is a simple alkyl group like methyl
or ethyl).

The only doubtful case is the secondary alkyl derivative, which can react by either mechanism, although it is not very good at either. The fi rst question you should ask when faced with
a new nucleophilic substitution is this ‘Is the carbon electrophile methyl, primary, secondary,
or tertiary?’ This will start you off on the right foot, which is why we introduced these important structural terms in Chapter 2.
Later in this chapter we will look in more detail at the differences between the two mechanisms and the structures that favour each, but all of what we say will build on the table
above.

###### A closer look at the SN1 reaction

In our discussion of the SN1 reaction above, we proposed the t-butyl carbocation as a reasonable intermediate formed by loss of bromide from t-butyl bromide. We now need to explain
the evidence we have that carbocations can indeed exist, and the reasons why the t-butyl
carbocation is much more stable than, for example, the n-butyl cation.
In Chapter 12 we introduced the idea of using a reaction energy profi le diagram to follow
the progress of a reaction from starting materials to products, via transition states and any
intermediates. The energy profi le diagram for the SN1 reaction between t-butyl bromide and
water looks something like this:


-----

transition state


reaction coordinate

The carbocation is shown as an intermediate—a species with a fi nite (if short) lifetime for
reasons we shall describe shortly. And because we know that the fi rst step, the formation of
the carbocation, is slow, that must be the step with the higher energy transition state. The
energy of that transition state, which determines the overall rate of the reaction, is closely
linked to the stability of the carbocation intermediate, and it is for this reason that the most
important factor in determining the effi ciency of an SN1 reaction is the stability or otherwise
of any carbocation that might be formed as an intermediate.


###### Carbocation stability

The t-butyl carbocation is relatively stable as far as carbocations go, but you would not be
able to keep it in a bottle on the
shelf! The concept of more and
less stable carbocations is
important in understanding the
SN1 reaction, but it is important
to realize that these terms are
all relative: even ‘stable’ carbocations are highly reactive
electron-defi cient species.


###### Shape and stability of carbocations

We discussed the planar shape of the methyl cation in Chapter 4 (p. 103), and the tert-butyl
cation is similar in structure: the electron-defi cient central carbon atom has only six electrons,
which it uses to form three σ bonds, and therefore also carries an empty p orbital. Any carbocation will have a planar carbon atom with an empty p orbital. Think of it this way: only fi lled
orbitals contribute to the energy of a molecule, so if you have to have an unfi lled orbital (which
a carbocation always does) it is best to make that unfi lled orbital as high in energy as possible to
keep the fi lled orbitals low in energy. p orbitals are higher in energy than s orbitals (or hybrid sp,
sp[2], or sp[3] orbitals for that matter) so the carbocation always keeps the p orbital empty.

We know that the t-butyl cation is stable enough to observe because of the work of George
Olah, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1994. The challenge is that carbocations are
very reactive electrophiles, so Olah’s idea was to have a solution containing no nucleophiles.
Any cation must have an anion to balance the charge, so the important advance was to fi nd
anions, consisting of a negatively charged atom surrounded by tightly held halogen atoms,
which are just too stable to be nucleophilic. Examples include BF4−,PF6−, and Sb6−. The fi rst is
small and tetrahedral and the others are larger and octahedral.
In these anions, the negative charge does not correspond to a lone pair of electrons (they are
like BH4− in this respect) and there is no orbital high enough in energy to act as a nucleophile.
By using a non-nucleophilic solvent, liquid SO2, at low temperature, Olah was able to turn
alcohols into carbocations with these counterions. This is what happens when tert-butanol is
treated with SbF5 and HF in liquid SO2. The acid protonates the hydroxyl group, allowing it to

The cation is left high and dry.

The proton NMR of this cation showed just one signal for the three methyl groups at 4.15 ppm,
quite far downfi eld for C–Me groups. The [13]C spectrum also showed downfi eld Me groups at
47.5 ppm, but the key evidence that the cation was formed was the shift of the central carbon
atom, which came at an amazing 320.6 ppm, way downfi eld from anything you have met before.
This carbon is very deshielded—it is positively charged and extremely electron defi cient.


From Olah’s work we know what the t-butyl cation looks like by NMR, so can we use NMR to try to detect it as an
intermediate in substitution reactions? If we mix t-BuBr and NaOH in an NMR tube and let the reaction run inside the
NMR machine, we see no signals belonging to the cation. But this proves nothing. We would not expect a reactive
intermediate to be present in any signifi cant concentration. There is a simple reason for this. If the cation is unstable, it
will react very quickly with any nucleophile around and there will never be any appreciable amount of cation in solution.
Its rate of formation will be much slower than its rate of reaction.


###### Alkyl substituents stabilize a carbocation

Olah found that he could measure the spectrum of the tert-butyl cation, but he was never able
to observe the methyl cation in solution. Why do those extra substituents stabilize the cationic centre?
Any charged organic intermediate is inherently unstable because of the charge. A carbocation can be formed only if it has some extra stabilization, and extra stabilization can come to
the planar carbocation structure from weak donation of σ bond electrons into the empty
p orbital of the cation. In the t-butyl cation, three of these donations occur at any one time: it
doesn’t matter if the C–H bonds point up or down; one C–H bond of each methyl group must
be parallel to one lobe of the empty p orbital at any one time. The fi rst diagram shows one
overlap in orbital terms and the second and third diagrams, three as dotted lines.

There is nothing special about the C–H bond donating electrons into an empty orbital: a
C–C bond is just as good and some bonds are better (C–Si, for example). But there must be a
bond of some sort—a hydrogen atom by itself has no lone pairs and no σ bonds so it cannot
stabilize a cation.
Planarity is so important to the structure of a carbocation that if a tertiary cation cannot
become planar, it is not formed. A classic case is the structure in the margin, which does not
react with nucleophiles either by SN1 or by SN2. It does not react by SN1 because the cation
cannot become planar, nor by SN2 because the nucleophile cannot approach the carbon atom
from the right direction.
In general, though, simple tertiary structures undergo effi cient SN1 substitution reactions.
With good leaving groups such as halides, substitutions can be done under neutral conditions; with less good leaving groups such as alcohols or ethers, acid catalysis is required. The
following group of reactions give an idea of the types of SN1 reactions that work well.

###### An adjacent C=C π system stabilizes a carbocation: allylic and benzylic carbocations

Tertiary carbocations are more stable than primary ones, but powerful stabilization is also provided when there is genuine conjugation between the empty p orbital and adjacent π or lone pair
electrons. The allyl cation has a fi lled (bonding) orbital containing two electrons delocalized
over all three atoms and an important empty orbital with coeffi cients on the end atoms only. It’s
this orbital that is attacked by nucleophiles. The curly arrow picture tells us the same thing.

Allylic electrophiles react well by the SN1 mechanism because the allyl cation is relatively
stable. Here’s an example of a reaction working in the opposite direction from most of those
you have seen so far—we start with the alcohol and form the bromide. Treatment of cyclohexenol with HBr gives the corresponding allylic bromide.

In this case, only one compound is formed because attack at either end of the allylic cation
gives the same product. But when the allylic cation is unsymmetrical this can be a nuisance
as a mixture of products may be formed. It doesn’t matter which of these two butenols you
treat with HBr, you get the same delocalized allylic cation.

When this cation reacts with Br[−], about 80% goes to one end and 20% to the other, giving
a mixture of butenyl bromides. This **regioselectivity (where the nucleophile attacks)**
is determined by steric hindrance: attack is faster at the less hindered end of the allylic
system.
Sometimes this ambiguity is useful. The tertiary allylic alcohol 2-methylbut-3-en-2-ol is
easy to prepare and reacts well by the SN1 mechanism because it can form a stable carbocation
that is both tertiary and allylic. The allylic carbocation intermediate is unsymmetrical and
reacts only at the less substituted end to give ‘prenyl bromide’.

The benzyl cation is about as stable as the allyl cation but lacks its ambiguity of reaction.
Although the positive charge is delocalized around the benzene ring, to three positions
in particular, the benzyl cation always reacts on the side chain so that aromaticity is
preserved.

An exceptionally stable cation is formed when three benzene rings can help to stabilize the
same positive charge. The result is the triphenylmethyl cation or, for short, the trityl cation.
Trityl chloride is used to form an ether with a primary alcohol group by an SN1 reaction. You
will notice that pyridine is used as solvent for the reaction. Pyridine (a weak base: the pKa of its
conjugate acid is 5.5—see Chapter 8) is not strong enough to remove the proton from the primary alcohol (pKa about 15), and there would be no point in using a base strong enough to
make RCH2O[−] as the nucleophile makes no difference to an SN1 reaction. Instead the TrCl ionizes fi rst to trityl cation, which now captures the primary alcohol and fi nally pyridine is able to
remove the proton from the oxonium ion. Pyridine does not catalyse the reaction; it just stops
it becoming too acidic by removing the HCl formed. Pyridine is also a convenient polar organic
solvent for ionic reactions.

The table below shows the rates of solvolysis (i.e. a reaction in which the solvent acts as the nucleophile) in 50% aqueous
ethanol for substituted allylic chlorides compared with benzylic chlorides and simple alkyl chlorides. The values give you
an idea of the relative reactivity towards substitution of the different classes of compound. These rates are mostly SN1,
but there will be some SN2 reactivity with the primary compounds.

###### Carbocations are stabilized by an adjacent lone pair

The alkyl chloride known as methyl chloromethyl ether, MeOCH2Cl, reacts very well with
alcohols to form ethers. Being a primary alkyl chloride, you might think that its reactions
would follow an SN2 mechanism, but in fact it has characteristic SN1 reactivity. As usual, the
reason for its preference for the SN1 mechanism is its ability to form a stabilized carbocation.
Loss of the chloride ion is assisted by the adjacent lone pair, and we can draw the resulting
cation either as an oxonium ion or as a carbocation.

If you think back to Chapter 11, you will recall that the fi rst step in the hydrolysis of an
acetal is a similar reaction, with one alkoxy group replaced by water to give a hemiacetal.
We considered the mechanism for this reaction in Chapter 11 but did not then concern
ourselves with a label for the fi rst step. It is in effect an SN1 substitution reaction: the decomposition of the protonated acetal to give an oxonium ion. If you compare this step with the
reaction of the chloroether we have just described you will see that they are very similar in
mechanism.

An SN2 mechanism is unlikely at such a crowded carbon atom. However, the main reason why the SN2 mechanism is
wrong is that the SN1 mechanism is so very effi cient, with a neighbouring MeO group whose lone pair can stabilize the
carbocation intermediate. The SN2 mechanism doesn’t get a chance.

This mechanism for the SN1 replacement of one electronegative group at a carbon atom by
a nucleophile where there is another electronegative group at the same carbon atom is very
general. You should look for it whenever there are two atoms such as O, N, S, Cl, or Br joined
to the same carbon atom. The better leaving groups (such as the halogens) need no acid catalyst but the less good ones (N, O, S) usually need acid.

by the SN1 mechanism rather than by the SN2 mechanism.

alkyl groups: of course, primary
allylic, benzylic, and RO or R2N
substituted primary derivatives
may react by SN1!


###### A closer look at the SN2 reaction

Among simple alkyl groups, methyl and primary alkyl groups always react by the SN2 mechanism and never by SN1. This is partly because the cations are unstable and partly because the
nucleophile can push its way in easily past the hydrogen atoms.
A common way to make ethers is to treat an alkoxide anion with an alkyl halide. If the alkyl
halide is a methyl compound, we can be sure that the reaction will go by the SN2 mechanism.
A strong base, here NaH, will be needed to form the alkoxide ion, since alcohols are weak acids
(pKa about 16). Methyl iodide is a suitable electrophile.

transition state and intermediate
in Chapter 12.


###### The transition state for an SN2 reaction

Another way to put this would be to say that the nucleophile, the methyl group, and the leaving group are all present in the transition state for the reaction. The transition state is the highest energy point on the reaction pathway. In the case of an SN2 reaction it will be the point
where the new bond from the nucleophile is partly formed while the old bond to the leaving
group is not yet completely broken. It will look something like this:

The dashed bonds in the transition state indicate partial bonds (the C–Nu bond is partly
formed and the C–X bond partly broken) and the charges in brackets indicate substantial
partial charges (about half a minus charge each in this case). Transition states are often shown
in square brackets and marked with the symbol ‡.
Another way to look at this situation is to consider the orbitals. The nucleophile must have
lone-pair electrons, which will interact with the σ* orbital of the C–X bond.

With the more acidic phenols (pKa about 10), NaOH is a strong enough base and dimethyl

strong base to make the alcohol into a better nucleophile because as we discussed on p. 331
the rate equation for an SN2 reaction tells us that the strength and concentration of the nucleophile affects the rate of the reaction.

In the transition state the carbon atom in the middle has a p orbital that shares one pair of
electrons between the old and the new bonds. Both these pictures suggest that the transition
state for an SN2 reaction has a more or less planar carbon atom at the centre with the nucleophile and the leaving group arranged at 180° to each other. This picture can help us explain two
important observations concerning the SN2 reaction—fi rstly the types of structures that react
effi ciently, and secondly the stereochemistry of the reaction.

###### Adjacent C==C or C=O π systems increase the rate of SN2 reactions

We have already established that methyl and primary alkyl compounds react well by the SN2
mechanism, while secondary alkyl compounds undergo SN2 reactions only reluctantly. But
there are other important structural features that also encourage the SN2 mechanism. Two of
these, allyl and benzyl groups, also encourage the SN1 mechanism.
Allyl bromide reacts well with alkoxides to make ethers, and shown below is the typical SN2
mechanism for this reaction. Also shown is the transition state for this reaction. Allyl compounds react rapidly by the SN2 mechanism because the π system of the adjacent double bond
can stabilize the transition state by conjugation. The p orbital at the reaction centre (shown in
brown, and corresponding to the brown orbital in the diagram on p. 340) has to make two
partial bonds with only two electrons—it is electron defi cient, and so any additional electron
density it can gather from an adjacent π system will stabilize the transition state and increase
the rate of the reaction.

The benzyl group acts in much the same way using the π system of the benzene ring for
conjugation with the p orbital in the transition state. Benzyl bromide reacts very well with
alkoxides to make benzyl ethers.
Among the fastest of all SN2 reactions are those where the leaving group is adjacent to a carbonyl group. With α-bromo carbonyl compounds, two neighbouring carbon atoms are both
powerfully electrophilic sites. Each has a low-energy empty orbital—π* from C=O and σ* from
C–Br (this is what makes them electrophilic)—and these can combine to form a new LUMO
(π* + σ*) lower in energy than either. Nucleophilic attack will occur easily where this new
orbital has its largest coeffi cient, shown in orange on the diagram.

The effect of this interaction between antibonding orbitals is that each group becomes more
electrophilic because of the presence of the other—the C=O group makes the C–Br bond
more reactive and the Br makes the C=O group more reactive. In fact, it may well be that the
nucleophile will attack the carbonyl group, but this will be reversible whereas displacement
of bromide is irreversible.
There are many examples of this type of reaction. Reactions with amines go well and the
aminoketone products are widely used in the synthesis of drugs.

###### Quantifying structural effects on SN2 reactions

Some actual data may help at this point. The rates of reaction of the following alkyl chlorides with KI in acetone at
50 °C broadly illustrate the patterns of SN2 reactivity we have just analysed. These are relative rates with respect to
n-BuCl as a ‘typical primary halide’. You should not take too much notice of precise fi gures but rather observe the trends
and notice that the variations are quite large—the full range from 0.02 to 100,000 is eight powers of ten.

###### Contrasts between SN1 and SN2

You have now met the key features of both important mechanisms for substitution. You
should at this stage in the chapter have a grasp of the kinetics, the nature of the intermediates
and transition states, and the simple steric and electronic factors that control reactivity in SN1
and SN2 reaction pathways.
We are now going to look in more detail at some other aspects where there are signifi cant
contrasts between the mechanisms, either because they lead to different outcomes or because
they lead to a change in reactivity towards one or the other of the two pathways.

###### A closer look at steric effects

We have already pointed out that having more alkyl substituents at the reaction centre
makes a compound more likely to react by SN1 than by SN2 for two reasons: fi rstly they make
a carbocation more stable, so favouring SN1, and secondly they make it hard for a nucleophile
to get close to the reaction centre in the rate-determining step, disfavouring SN2. Let’s look
in more detail at the transition state for the slow steps of the two reactions and see how steric
hindrance affects both.


-----

In the approach to the SN2 transition state, the carbon atom under attack gathers in another
substituent and becomes (transiently) fi ve-coordinate. The angles between the substituents
decrease from tetrahedral to about 90°.

In the starting material there are four angles of about 109°. In the transition state (enclosed
in square brackets and marked ‡ as usual) there are three angles of 120° and six angles of 90°,
a signifi cant increase in crowding. The larger the substituents R, the more serious this is, and
the greater the increase in energy of the transition state. We can easily see the effects of steric
hindrance if we compare these three structural types:

 - methyl: CH3–X: very fast SN2 reaction

 - primary alkyl: RCH2–X: fast SN2 reaction

 - secondary alkyl: R2CH–X: slow SN2 reaction.

The opposite is true of the SN1 reaction. The rate-determining step is simply the loss of the
leaving group, and the transition state for this step will look something like the structure
shown below—with a longer, weaker, and more polarized C–X bond than the starting material. The starting material is again tetrahedral (four angles of about 109°) and in the intermediate cation there are just three angles of 120°—fewer and less serious interactions. The
transition state will be on the way towards the cation, and because the R groups are further
apart in the transition state than in the starting material, large R groups will actually decrease
the energy of the transition state relative to the starting material. SN1 reactions are therefore
accelerated by alkyl substituents both for this reason and because they stabilize the cation.

###### Stereochemistry and substitution

Look back at the scheme we showed you for the SN2 reaction on p. 340. It shows the nucleophile attacking the carbon atom on the opposite side from the leaving group. Look carefully
at the carbon atom it is attacking and you see that its substituents end up turning inside out
as the reaction goes along, just like an umbrella in a high wind. If the carbon atom under
attack is a stereogenic centre (Chapter 14), the result will be inversion of confi guration.
Something very different happens in the SN1 reaction, and we will now illustrate the difference with a simple sequence of reactions.

**H** **OH** **SOClF** **H** **H2O** **H** **OH**


Notice how the transition state
for the SN1 reaction is really very
close in structure to the carbocation, and you can see that
they also lie very close to one
another in the energy profi le
diagram on p. 334. When we
say that the rate of an SN1 reaction is increased by stabilization
of the carbocation, what we
really mean of course is that the
rate is increased by stabilization
of the transition state leading to
the carbocation. However, they
are so similar in structure that
you can assume that steric and
electronic effects on the carbocation will be very similar to
those on the carbocation.

Alternatively, we can fi rst make the hydroxyl group into a good enough leaving group to
take part in an SN2 reaction. The leaving group we shall use, a sulfonate ester, will be introduced to you in a few pages’ time, but for now you just need to accept that nucleophilic attack
of the OH group on a sulfonyl chloride in pyridine solution gives the sulfonate ester shown
below in orange: no bonds have been formed or broken at the chiral carbon atom, which still
has (S) stereochemistry.

Now we can carry out an SN2 reaction on the sulfonate with an acetate anion. A tetra-alkyl
ammonium salt is used in the solvent DMF to avoid solvating the acetate, making it as powerful a nucleophile as possible and getting a clean SN2 reaction. This is the key step and we don’t
want any doubt about the outcome. The sulfonate is an excellent leaving group—the charge
is delocalized across all three oxygen atoms.
The product sec-butyl acetate is optically active and we can measure its optical rotation. But
this tells us nothing. Unless we know the true rotation for pure sec-butyl acetate, we don’t yet
know whether it is optically pure nor even whether it really is inverted. We expect it to have
(R) stereochemistry, but we can easily fi nd out for sure. All we have to do is to hydrolyse the
ester and get the original alcohol back again. We know the true rotation of the alcohol—it was
our starting material—and we know that ester hydrolysis (Chapter 10) proceeds by attack at
the carbonyl carbon—it can’t affect the stereochemistry of the chiral centre.

Now we really know where we are. This new sample of sec-butanol has the same rotation as

inverted. Somewhere in this sequence there has been an inversion, and we know it wasn’t in
the formation of the sulfonate or the hydrolysis of the acetate as no bonds are formed or broken at the stereogenic centre in these steps. It must have been in the SN2 reaction itself.

**SN1 reaction generally goes with racemization.**


###### The effect of solvent

Why was the SN2 reaction we have just shown you carried out in DMF? You will generally
fi nd SN2 reactions are carried out in aprotic, and often less polar, solvents. SN1 reactions are


-----

typically carried out in polar, protic solvents. A common solvent for an SN2 reaction is
acetone—just polar enough to dissolve the ionic reagents, but not as polar as, say, acetic acid,
a common solvent for the SN1 reaction.
It is fairly obvious why the SN1 reaction needs a polar solvent: the rate-determining step
involves the formation of ions (usually a negatively charged leaving group and a positively
charged carbocation) and the rate of this process will be increased by a polar solvent that can
solvate these ions. More precisely, the transition state is more polar than the starting materials
(note the charges in brackets in the scheme above) and so is stabilized by the polar solvent.
Hence solvents like water or carboxylic acids (RCO2H) are ideal.
It is less obvious why a less polar solvent is better for the SN2 reaction. The most common
SN2 reactions use an anion as the nucleophile. The transition state is then less polar than the
localized anion as the charge is spread between two atoms. Here’s an example: the formation
of an alkyl iodide from an alkyl bromide. Acetone fails to solvate the iodide well, making it
more reactive; the transition state is less in need of solvation, so overall the reaction is faster.

DMF and DMSO, the polar aprotic solvents we discussed in Chapter 12 (p. 255) are also good
solvents for SN2 reactions because they dissolve ionic compounds well but fail to solvate anions well, making them more reactive. The choice of Bu4N[+]—a large, non-coordinating cation—as the counterion for the reaction on p. 344 was also made with this in mind.



- Acetone also assists this
reaction because it dissolves
sodium iodide but not the
sodium bromide product, which
precipitates from solution and
prevents bromide acting as a
competing nucleophile.


###### Quantifying the rates of SN1 and SN2 reactions

The data below illustrate the effect of structure on the rates of SN1 and SN2 reactions. The green curve on the graph
shows the rates (k1) of an SN1 reaction: the conversion of alkyl bromides to alkyl formate esters in formic acid at 100 °C.
Formic acid is a polar solvent and a weak nucleophile: perfect for an SN1 reaction. The red curve shows the rates of
displacement of Br [−] by radioactive [82]Br [−] in acetone at 25 °C. Acetone solvent and the good nucleophile Br [−] favour SN2.
The rates (k2) are multiplied by 10[5] to bring both curves onto the same graph.

###### A closer look at electronic effects

We mentioned above that adjacent π systems increase the rate of the SN2 reaction by stabilizing the transition state, and likewise increase the rate of SN1 reactions by stabilizing the carbocation. The effect on the SN2 reaction applies to both C=C (electron-rich) and C=O
(electron-defi cient) π systems, but only C=C π systems increase the rate of SN1 reactions.
Adjacent C=O groups in fact signifi cantly decrease the reactivity of alkyl halides towards SN1
reactions because the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group greatly destabilizes
the carbocation.
Electron-withdrawing or -donating groups can also tip fi nely balanced cases from one
mechanism to another. For example, benzylic compounds react well by either SN1 or SN2, and
a change of solvent, as just discussed, might switch them from one mechanism to another.
Alternatively, a benzylic compound that has a well-placed electron-donating group able to
stabilize the cation will also favour the _SN1 mechanism. Thus 4-methoxybenzyl chloride_
reacts by SN1 for this reason: here we show the methoxy group stabilizing the cation intermediate by assisting departure of the chloride.

Rate measurements for benzylic
chlorides illustrate the importance of this effect. We can force
them all to react by SN1 by using
methanol as the solvent (methanol is a poor nucleophile and a
polar solvent: both disfavour
SN2). Comparing with the rate of
substitution of benzyl chloride
itself, PhCH2Cl, 4-methoxybenzyl
chloride reacts with methanol
about 2500 times faster and the
4-nitrobenzyl chloride about
3000 times more slowly.


On the other hand, an electron-withdrawing group, such as a nitro group, within the benzylic
compound will decrease the rate of the SN1 reaction and allow the SN2 mechanism to take over.

We have considered the important effects of the basic carbon skeleton and of solvent on the
course of SN1 and SN2 reactions and we shall now look at two fi nal structural factors: the
nucleophile and the leaving group. We shall tackle the leaving group fi rst because it plays an
important role in both SN1 and SN2 reactions.

###### The leaving group in SN1 and SN2 reactions

The leaving group is important in both SN1 and SN2 reactions because departure of the leaving
group is involved in the rate-determining step of both mechanisms.

So far you have mostly seen halides and water (from protonated alcohols) as leaving groups.
Leaving groups involving halides or oxygen atoms are by far the most important, and now we
need to establish the principles that make for good and bad leaving groups. As a chemist, we
want leaving groups to have some staying power, so that our compounds are not too unstable,
but we also don’t want them to outstay their welcome—they must have just the right level of
reactivity.

###### Halides as leaving groups

With halide leaving groups two main factors are at work: the strength of the C–halide bond
and the stability of the halide ion. The strengths of the C–X bonds can be measured easily, but
how can we measure anion stability? One way, which you met in Chapter 8, was to use the pKa
values of the acids HX. pKa quantifi es the stability of an anion relative to its conjugate acid. We
want to know about the stability of an anion relative to that anion bonded to C, not H, but pKa
will do as a guide.

- You were given the same
message in Chapter 10 in
relation to substitutions at C=O:
hydroxide is never a leaving
group. There is one exception to
this rule, in the E1cb reaction,
which you will meet in Chapter
17, but it’s rare enough to
ignore at this stage.


The table in the margin shows both bond strengths and pKa. It is clearly easiest to break a
C–I bond and most diffi cult to break a C–F bond. Iodide sounds like the best leaving group.
We get the same message from the pKa values: HI is the strongest acid, so it must ionize easily
to H[+] and I[−]. This result is quite correct—iodide is an excellent leaving group and fl uoride a
very bad one, with the other halogens in between.

###### Nucleophilic substitutions on alcohols: how to get an OH group to leave

Now what about leaving groups joined to the carbon atom by a C–O bond? There are many of
these but the most important are OH itself, the carboxylic esters, and the sulfonate esters. First
we must make one thing clear: alcohols themselves do not react with nucleophiles. In other
words, OH[−] is never a leaving group. Why not? For a start hydroxide ion is very basic, and if
the nucleophile were strong enough to displace hydroxide ion it would be more than strong
enough to remove the proton from the alcohol.

But we do want to use alcohols in nucleophilic substitution reactions because they are easily
made (by the reactions in Chapter 9, for example). The simplest solution is to protonate the OH
group with strong acid. This will work only if the nucleophile is compatible with strong acid, but
many are. The preparation of t-BuCl from t-BuOH simply by shaking it with concentrated HCl is
a good example. This is obviously an SN1 reaction with the t-butyl cation as intermediate.

Similar methods can be used to make secondary alkyl bromides with HBr alone and primary

Another way to approach the substitution of OH is to make it a better leaving group by combination with an element that forms very strong bonds to oxygen. The most popular choices
are phosphorus and sulfur. Making primary alkyl bromides with PBr3 usually works well.
The phosphorus reagent is fi rst attacked by the OH group (an SN2 reaction at phosphorus)
and the displacement of an oxyanion bonded to phosphorus is now a good reaction because
of the anion stabilization by phosphorus.

###### Sulfonate esters—tosylates and mesylates—from alcohols

The most widely used way of making a hydroxyl group into a good leaving group is to make it
into a sulfonate ester. Primary and secondary alcohols are easily converted to sulfonate esters
by treating with sulfonyl chlorides and base. The sulfonate esters are often crystalline, and are
so widely used that they have been given trivial names—tosylates for p-toluenesulfonates and
_mesylates for methanesulfonates—and the functional groups have been allocated the ‘organic_
element’ symbols Ts and Ms.
Tosylates (p-toluenesulfonates) are made by treating alcohols with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (or tosyl chloride) in the presence of pyridine. A similar reaction (but with a different
mechanism, which we will discuss in Chapter 17) with methanesulfonyl chloride (mesyl
chloride) gives a mesylate (methanesulfonate).

Sulfonic acids RSO3H are strong acids (pKa around 0) and so any sulfonate RSO3− is a good
leaving group: tosylates and mesylates can be displaced by almost anything. As you saw in
Chapter 8, the lithium derivative of an alkyne can be prepared by deprotonation with the
very strong base butyllithium. In the example below, the tosyl derivative of a primary alcohol
reacts with this lithium derivative in an SN2 reaction. Note that the tosylate leaving group is
represented as TsO[−] (not Ts[−]!).

On p. 344 you saw a tosylate (we just called it a sulfonate ester then) being displaced by
acetate in an SN2 reaction. Acetate is not a very good nucleophile, and it is a testament to the
power of the sulfonate esters that they are willing to act as leaving groups even with acetate,
which is usually too weak to react by SN2.

###### Substituting alcohols with the Mitsunobu reaction

Rather than use two steps to convert the OH group fi rst to a sulfonate ester, and then displace
it, it is possible to use a method that allows us to put an alcohol straight into a reaction mixture and get an SN2 product in one operation. This is the Mitsunobu reaction. In this reaction,
the alcohol becomes the electrophile, the nucleophile is usually relatively weak (the conjugate
base of a carboxylic acid, for example), and there are two other reagents.

One of these reagents, Ph3P, triphenylphosphine, is the simple phosphine you met in
Chapter 11. Phosphines are nucleophilic, but not basic like amines. The other reagent deserves
more comment. Its full name is diethyl azodicarboxylate, or DEAD.
So how does the Mitsunobu reaction work? It’s a long mechanism, but don’t be discouraged:
there is a logic to each step and we will guide you through it gently. The fi rst stage involves
neither the alcohol nor the added nucleophile. The phosphine adds to the weak N=N π bond
to give an anion stabilized by one of the ester groups.

You will note that the nucleophile has been added as its conjugate acid ‘HNu’—often this
might be a carboxylic acid, for example benzoic acid. The anion produced by this fi rst stage is
basic enough to remove a proton from this acid, generating Nu[−] ready for reaction.

Oxygen and phosphorus have a strong affi nity, as we saw in the conversion of alcohols to
bromides with PBr3 (p. 348) and in the Wittig reaction (Chapter 11, pp. 237–8), and the positively charged phosphorus is now attacked by the alcohol, displacing a second nitrogen anion
in an SN2 reaction at phosphorus. The nitrogen anion generated in this step is stabilized by
conjugation with the ester, but rapidly removes the proton from the alcohol to give an electrophilic R–O–PPh3+ species and a by-product, the reduced form of DEAD.

Finally, the anion of the nucleophile can now attack this phosphorus derivative of the alcohol in a normal SN2 reaction at carbon with the phosphine oxide as the leaving group. We
have arrived at the products.

**PPh3** **Nu** **R** + **O** **PPh3**

SN2 product phosphine oxide

The whole process takes place in one operation. The four reagents are all added to one fl ask
and the products are the phosphine oxide, the reduced azo diester with two NH bonds replacing the N=N double bond, and the product of an SN2 reaction on the alcohol. Another way to
look at this reaction is that a molecule of water must formally be lost: OH must be removed
from the alcohol and H from the nucleophile. These atoms end up in very stable molecules—
the P=O and N–H bonds are strong where the N=N bond was weak, compensating for the
sacrifi ce of the strong C–O bond in the starting alcohol.
If this is all correct, then the vital SN2 step should lead to inversion as it always does in SN2
reactions. This turns out to be one of the great strengths of the Mitsunobu reaction—it is a


-----

reliable way to replace OH by a nucleophile with inversion of confi guration. The most dramatic example is probably the formation of esters from secondary alcohols with inversion.
Normal ester formation leads to retention as the C–O bond of the alcohol is not broken: compare these two reactions and note the destination of the coloured oxygen (and hydrogen)
atoms.

###### Ethers as electrophiles


Ethers are stable molecules that do not react with nucleophiles: THF and Et2O are widely used
as solvents for this reason. To make them react, we need to make the oxygen positively charged
so that it can accept electrons more readily, and we also need to use a very good nucleophile.
A good way of doing both is to treat with HBr or HI, which protonate the oxygen. Iodide and
bromide are excellent nucleophiles in SN2 reactions (see below), and attack will occur preferentially at the carbon atom more susceptible to SN2 reactions (usually the less hindered one).
Aryl alkyl ethers cleave only on the alkyl side—you cannot get attack through the benzene
ring.

SN2 attack at sp[3 ]C


So far we have used only protic acids to help oxygen atoms to leave. But Lewis acids—species
other than H[+] that also have an empty orbital capable of accepting a lone pair—work well too,
and the cleavage of aryl alkyl ethers with BBr3 is a good example. Trivalent boron compounds
have an empty p orbital so they are very electrophilic and prefer to attack oxygen. The resulting oxonium ion can be attacked by Br[−] in an SN2 reaction.


Lewis acids were introduced in
Chapter 8, p. 180.

One family of ethers reacts in nucleophilic substitution even without protic or Lewis acids.
They are the three-membered cyclic ethers called epoxides (or oxiranes). The leaving group is
genuinely an alkoxide anion RO[−], so obviously some special feature must be present in these
ethers making them unstable. This feature is ring strain, which comes from the angle between
the bonds in the three-membered ring that has to be 60° instead of the ideal tetrahedral angle
of 109°. You could subtract these numbers and say that there is ‘49° of strain’ at each carbon
atom, making about 150° of strain in the molecule. This is a lot: the molecule would be much

more stable if the strain were released by opening up to restore the ideal tetrahedral angle at
all atoms. This can be done by one nucleophilic attack.

Epoxides react cleanly with amines to give amino alcohols. We have not so far featured
amines as nucleophiles because their reactions with alkyl halides are often bedevilled by
overreaction (see the next section), but with epoxides they give good results.



- When epoxides are
substituted differently at either
end, the nucleophile has a
choice of which end to attack.
The factors that control this will
be discussed in Chapter 24.


It is easy to see that inversion occurs in these SN2 reactions when the epoxide is attached to
(or ‘fused with’) another ring. With this fi ve-membered ring nucleophilic attack with inversion gives the trans product. As the epoxide in the starting material is up, attack has to come
from underneath. The new C–N bond is down and inversion has occurred.

###### The nucleophile in SN1 reactions

We established earlier that in an SN1 reaction the nucleophile is not important with regard
to rate. The rate-determining step of the reaction is loss of the leaving group, so good and
bad nucleophiles all give products. We don’t need to deprotonate the nucleophile to make
it more reactive (water and hydroxide work just as well as each other) and this means that
SN1 reactions are often carried out under acidic conditions, to assist departure of a leaving
group.
Compare, for example, these typical conditions used to make a methyl ether and a tertbutyl ether. The methyl ether is made, as you saw on p. 340, using methyl iodide in an SN2
reaction. It needs a good nucleophile, so the alcohol is deprotonated to make an alkoxide
with sodium hydride in DMF, which, as you saw on p. 345, is a good solvent for SN2 reactions. The tert-butyl ether on the other hand is made simply by stirring the alcohol with
_tert-butanol and a little acid. No base is needed, and the reaction proceeds rapidly to give the_
_tert-butyl ether._

###### A very bad nucleophile in a good SN1 reaction: the Ritter reaction

An interesting result of the unimportance of the nucleophile to the rate (and therefore the
usefulness) of an SN1 reaction is that very poor nucleophiles indeed may react in the absence
of anything better. Nitriles, for example, are very poorly basic and nucleophilic because the
lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is in a low-energy sp orbital. However, if t-butanol
is dissolved in a nitrile as solvent and strong acid is added, a reaction does take place. The acid
does not protonate the nitrile, but does protonate the alcohol to produce the t-butyl cation in
the usual fi rst step of an SN1 reaction. This cation is reactive enough to combine with even
such a weak nucleophile as the nitrile.

The resulting cation is captured by the water molecule released in the fi rst step and an

###### The nucleophile in the SN2 reaction

In an SN2 reaction, a good nucleophile is essential. We fi nish this chapter with a survey of
effective choices for forming new bonds to sp[3] by SN2 reactions, and a description of the factors that determine how good a nucleophile will be.

###### Nitrogen nucleophiles: a problem and a solution

Amines are good nucleophiles, but reactions between ammonia and alkyl halides rarely
lead cleanly to single products. The problem is that the product of the substitution is
at least as nucleophilic as the starting material, so it competes for reaction with the alkyl
halide.

primary amine reacts again with alkyl halide

Even this is not all! The alkylation steps keep going, forming the secondary and tertiary
amines, and stopping only when the non-nucleophilic tetra-alkylammonium ion R4N[+] is
formed. The problem is that the extra alkyl groups push more and more electron density
onto N, making each product more reactive than the previous. The quaternary ammonium
salt could probably be made cleanly if a large excess of alkyl halide RX is used, but other
more controlled methods are needed for the synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary
amines.
One solution for primary amines is to replace ammonia with azide ion N3−. This linear triatomic species, nucleophilic at both ends, is a slender rod of electrons able to insert itself into
almost any electrophilic site. It is available as the water-soluble sodium salt NaN3.


Sometimes these alkylations can
work, but usually only if the
alkylating agent or the amine is
very hindered, or the alkylating
agent contains an inductive electron-withdrawing group (such as
the hydroxyl group generated
when an epoxide is opened:
epoxides are reliable alkylating
agents for amines). With amine
alkylations, you should nonetheless always expect the worst.

Azide reacts only once with alkyl halides because the product, an alkyl azide, is no longer
nucleophilic. However, rarely is the azide product required: it is usually reduced to a primary
amine by catalytic hydrogenation (H2 over a Pd catalyst—see Chapter 23), LiAlH4, or
triphenylphosphine.


###### A warning about azides

Azides can be converted by
heat—or even sometimes just
by a sharp blow—suddenly into
nitrogen gas. In other words
they are potentially explosive,
particularly inorganic (that is,
ionic) azides and low molecular
weight covalent organic azides.


Azides react with epoxides too. This epoxide is one diastereoisomer (trans) but racemic and
the symbol (±) under each structure reminds you of this (Chapter 14). Azide attacks at either
end of the three-membered ring (the two ends are the same) to give the hydroxy-azide. The
reaction is carried out in a mixture of water and an organic solvent with ammonium chloride
as buffer to provide a proton for the intermediate. Triphenylphosphine in water is used for
reduction to the primary amine.

###### Sulfur nucleophiles are better than oxygen nucleophiles in SN2 reactions

Thiolate anions RS[−] make excellent nucleophiles in SN2 reactions on alkyl halides. It is enough
to combine the thiol, sodium hydroxide, and the alkyl halide to get a good yield of the sulfi de.

**PhSH   +   NaOH   +   n-BuBr** **PhSBu   +   NaBr**

thiol sulfide

Thiols are more acidic than water (pKa of RSH is typically 9–10, pKa of PhSH is 6.4, pKa of
H2O is 15.7) and rapid proton transfer from sulfur to oxygen gives the thiolate anion that acts
as a nucleophile in the SN2 reaction.

###### Effectiveness of different nucleophiles in the SN2 reaction

In Chapter 10 we pointed out that basicity is nucleophilicity towards protons. At that stage we
said that nucleophilicity towards the carbonyl group parallels basicity almost exactly. We
are able to use pKa as a guide to the effectiveness of nucleophilic substitution reactions at the
**carbonyl group.**
During this chapter you have had various hints that nucleophilicity towards saturated carbon is not so straightforward. Now we must look at this question seriously and try to give you
helpful guidelines.

**1.** If the atom that is forming the new bond to carbon is the same over a range of
nucleophiles—it might be oxygen, for example, and the nucleophiles might be HO[−],
PhO[−], AcO[−], and TsO[−]—then nucleophilicity does parallel basicity. The anions of the
weakest acids are the best nucleophiles. The order for the nucleophiles we have just
mentioned will be: HO[−] > PhO[−] > AcO[−] > TsO[−]. The actual values for the rates of attack
of the various nucleophiles on MeBr in EtOH relative to the rate of reaction with water
(= 1) are given in the table below.

Relative rates (water = 1) of reaction with MeBr
in EtOH

Nucleophile X[–] pKa of HX Relative rate

HO[−] 15.7 1.2 × 10[4]

PhO[−] 10.0 2.0 × 10[3]

AcO[−] 4.8 9 × 10[2]

H2O –1.7 1.0

CIO4− –10 0

**2.** If the atoms that are forming the new bond to carbon are not the same over the range of
nucleophiles we are considering, then another factor is important. In the very last
examples we have been discussing we have emphasized that RS[−] is an excellent
nucleophile for saturated carbon. Let us put that another way: RS[−] is a better nucleophile
for saturated carbon than RO[−], even though RO[−] is more basic than RS[−] (see table below).

Relative rates (water = 1) of reaction with MeBr in EtOH

Nucleophile X[–] pKa of HX Relative rate

Sulfur is plainly a better nucleophile than oxygen for saturated carbon. Why should this be? As
we discussed back in Chapter 5, there are two main factors controlling bimolecular reactions: (1)
electrostatic attraction (simple attraction of opposite charges or partial charges) and (2) bonding
interactions between the HOMO of the nucleophile and the LUMO of the electrophile.

Electronegativities:

A proton is, of course, positively charged, so electrostatic attraction is the more important
factor in nucleophilicity towards H[+], or pKa. The carbonyl group too has a substantial positive
charge on the carbon atom, arising from the uneven distribution of electrons in the C=O
π bond, and reactions of nucleophiles with carbonyl groups are also heavily infl uenced by
electrostatic attraction, with HOMO–LUMO interactions playing a smaller role.
When it comes to saturated carbon atoms carrying leaving groups, polarization is typically
much less important. There is, of course, some polarity in the bond between a saturated carbon atom and, say, a bromine atom, but the electronegativity difference between C and Br is
less than half that between C and O. In alkyl iodides, one of the best classes of electrophiles
in SN2 reactions, there is in fact almost no dipole at all—the electronegativity of C is 2.55 and
that of I is 2.66.

What does matter is the strength of the HOMO–LUMO interaction. In a nucleophilic attack
on the carbonyl group, the nucleophile adds in to the low-energy π* orbital. In a nucleophilic
attack on a saturated carbon atom, the nucleophile must donate its electrons to the σ* orbital
of the C–X bond, as illustrated in the margin for an alkyl bromide reacting with the nonbonding lone pair of a nucleophile.
σ* antibonding orbitals are, of course, higher in energy than non-bonding lone pairs, but
the higher the energy of the nucleophile’s lone pair, the better the overlap. The 3sp[3] lone-pair
electrons of sulfur overlap better with the high-energy σ* orbital of the C–X bond than do
the lower energy 2sp[3] lone-pair electrons on oxygen because the higher energy of the sulfur
electrons brings them closer in energy to the C–X σ* orbital. The conclusion is that nucleophiles from lower down the periodic table are more effective in SN2 reactions than those from
the top rows.

###### Hard and soft nucleophiles

The fact that some nucleophiles, like R3P: and RS[−], react very fast at saturated C atoms (they
have high-energy lone pairs), but very poorly at C=O groups (they are either uncharged or
have charge spread diffusely over large orbitals) gives them a different type of character from
strongly basic nucleophiles like HO[−] that attack C=O groups rapidly. We call nucleophiles
that react well at saturated carbon soft nucleophiles; those that are more basic and react well
with carbonyl groups are referred to as **hard nucleophiles. These are useful and evocative**
terms because the soft nucleophiles are indeed rather large and fl abby with diffuse highenergy electrons while the hard nucleophiles are small and spiky with closely held electrons
and high charge density.
When we say ‘hard’ (nucleophile or electrophile) we refer to species whose reactions are
dominated by electrostatic attraction and when we say ‘soft’ (nucleophile or electrophile) we
refer to species whose reactions are dominated by HOMO–LUMO interactions.

###### Nucleophiles and leaving groups compared

In Chapter 10 we explained that, in a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group, a good
nucleophile is a bad leaving group and vice versa. We set you the challenge of predicting
which way the following reaction would go.



- Just to remind you: reactions
dominated by electrostatic
attraction also need to pass
electrons from HOMO to LUMO,
but reactions that are dominated
by HOMO–LUMO interactions
need have no contribution from
electrostatic attraction.

**NH3**


**O**


ester **OMe** ? **NH2** amide

**MeOH**

You should by now understand well that the reaction goes from ester to amide rather than
the other way round, because NH3 is a better nucleophile than MeOH and NH2− is a worse leaving group than MeO[−].
The SN2 reaction is different: some of the best nucleophiles are also the best leaving groups.
The most important examples of this are bromide and iodide. As the table on p. 356 showed,
iodide ion is one of the best nucleophiles towards saturated carbon because it is at the bottom
of its group in the periodic table and its lone-pair electrons are very high in energy. Alkyl
iodides are readily formed from alkyl chlorides or tosylates. Here are two examples. The fi rst
is assisted by the solvent, acetone, which allows NaCl to precipitate and drives the reaction
forward.

- We explained on p. 347 why
I[−] is such a good leaving group:
the C–I bond is particularly
weak. The poor overlap between
the atomic orbitals on C and on I
also mean that the σ* is low
lying and easily accessible to the
nucleophile’s HOMO.


The second example is from the preparation of a phosphonium salt used in a synthesis of
terpenes. An unsaturated primary alcohol was fi rst made into its tosylate, the tosylate was
converted into the iodide, and the iodide into the phosphonium salt.

But why this roundabout route via the iodide? The answer is that as well as being an excellent nucleophile, iodide is such a good leaving group that alkyl iodides are often used as
intermediates to encourage substitution with other nucleophiles. Yields are often higher if the
alkyl iodide is prepared than if the eventual nucleophile is reacted directly with the alkyl
tosylate or chloride.
However, iodine is expensive, and a way round that problem is to use a catalytic amount of
iodide. The phosphonium salt below is formed slowly from benzyl bromide but the addition
of a small amount of LiI speeds up the reaction considerably.

The iodide reacts both as a better nucleophile than Ph3P and then as a better leaving group

###### Looking forward: elimination and rearrangement reactions

Simple nucleophilic substitutions at saturated carbon atoms are fundamental reactions found
wherever organic chemistry is practised. They are used in industry on an enormous scale and
in pharmaceutical laboratories to make important drugs. They are worth studying for their
importance and relevance.
There is another side to this simple picture. These were among the fi rst reactions whose
mechanisms were thoroughly investigated by Ingold in the 1930s and since then they have
probably been studied more than any other reactions. All our understanding of organic
mechanisms begins with SN1 and SN2 reactions, and you need to understand these basic
mechanisms properly.
The carbocations you met in this chapter are reactive intermediates not only in SN1 substitutions but in other reactions too. One of the most convincing pieces of evidence for their
formation is that they undergo reactions other than simple addition to nucleophiles. For
example, the carbon skeleton of the cation may rearrange, as we will discuss in Chapter 36.


A nucleophilic catalyst speeds
up a reaction by acting as both
a good nucleophile and a good
leaving group. You saw pyridine
performing a similar function in
substitution reactions at the
C=O group of acid anhydrides
in Chapter 10.

Another common fate of cations, and something that may also happen instead of an

###### Bond rotation allows chains of atoms to adopt a number of conformations

Several chapters of this book have considered how to fi nd out the structure of molecules. We
have seen X-ray crystallography pictures, which reveal exactly where the atoms are in crystals; we have looked at IR spectroscopy, which gives us information about the bonds in the
molecule, and at NMR spectroscopy, which gives us information about the atoms themselves
and how they are joined up. Up to now, we have mainly been interested in determining which
atoms are bonded to which other atoms and also the shapes of small localized groups of
atoms. For example, a methyl group has three hydrogen atoms bonded to one carbon atom
and the atoms around this carbon are located at the corners of a tetrahedron; a ketone consists
of a carbon atom bonded to two other carbon atoms and doubly bonded to an oxygen atom,
with all these atoms in the same plane.
But, on a slightly larger scale, shape is not usually so well defi ned. Rotation is possible about
single bonds and this rotation means that, while the localized arrangement of atoms stays
the same (every saturated carbon atom is still always tetrahedral), the molecule as a whole
can adopt a number of different shapes. Shown on the next page are several snapshot views
of one molecule—it happens to be a pheromone used by pea moths to attract a mate.
Although the structures look dissimilar, they differ from one another only by rotation about
one or more single bonds. Whilst the overall shapes differ, the localized structure is still the

we will pick up on later: the arrangement about the double bond always remains the same
because double bonds can’t rotate.

in Chapters 4 and 12.

At room temperature in solution, all the single bonds in the molecule are constantly
rotating—the chances that two molecules will have exactly the same shape at any one time
are quite small.
Yet, even though no two molecules have exactly the same shape at any one time, they are still
all the same chemical compound—they have all the same atoms attached in the same way. We
call the different shapes of molecules of the same compound different conformations.

###### Conformation and confi guration

To get from one conformation to another, we can rotate about as many single bonds as we like.
The one thing we can’t do though is to break any bonds. This is why we can’t rotate about a
double bond—to do so we would need to break the π bond. Below are some pairs of structures
that can be interconverted by rotating about single bonds: they are all different conformations of the same molecule.

three compounds, each shown in two conformations



- **Make models**

If you fi nd this hard to see, get a
set of molecular models and
build the fi rst one of each pair.
You should be able to rotate it
straightforwardly into the second
without breaking your model.
Our advice throughout this
chapter, certainly with things that
you fi nd diffi cult to understand
from the two-dimensional
drawings to which we are
limited, is to make models.

The next block of molecules is something quite different: these pairs can only be
interconverted by breaking a bond. This means that they have different confi gurations—
confi gurations can be interconverted only by breaking bonds. Compounds with different
confi gurations are called stereoisomers and we dealt with them in Chapter 14.

###### Barriers to rotation
We saw in Chapter 7 that rotation about the C–N bond in an amide is relatively slow at
room temperature—the NMR spectrum of DMF clearly shows two methyl signals (p. 156). In
Chapter 12 you learned that the rate of a chemical process is associated with an energy barrier
(this holds both for reactions and simple bond rotations): the lower the rate, the higher the
barrier. Rotation about single bonds is fast at room temperature, but there is nonetheless a
barrier to rotation in ethane (A), for example, of about 12 kJ mol[−][1].

The energy barrier for rotation about the single bond in butadiene (B) is slightly larger
because of the weak conjugation between the double bonds, but the barrier to rotation about
the genuine double bond in but-2-ene (D) is enormous and no rotation is seen. The energy
barrier to the rotation about the C–N bond in an amide such as DMF (C) is usually about
80 kJ mol[−][1], translating into a rate of about 0.1 s[−][1] at 20 °C. The conjugation in amides is well
developed, and the C–N bond has signifi cant double-bond character.


-----

###### Rates and barriers

It can be useful to remember some simple guidelines to the way in which energy barriers relate to rates of rotation, as
discussed in Chapter 12. For example:

 - A barrier of 73 kJ mol[−1] allows one rotation every second at 25 °C (that is, the rate is 1 s[−1]).

 - Every 6 kJ mol[−1] changes the rate at 25 °C by about a factor of 10.

To see signals in an NMR spectrum for two different conformations, they must interconvert no faster than (very roughly)
1000 s[−1]—a barrier of about 55 kJ mol[−1] at 25 °C. This is why NMR shows two methyl signals for DMF, but only one set
of signals for butadiene. See p. 374 for more on this.
For conformations to interconvert slowly enough for them to exist as different compounds, the barrier must be over
100 kJ mol[−1]. The barrier to rotation about a C=C double bond is 260 kJ mol[−1]—which is why we can separate E and
Z isomers.


###### Conformations of ethane

Why should there be an energy barrier in the rotation about a single bond? In order to answer
this question, we should start with the simplest C–C bond possible—the one in ethane.
Ethane has two extreme conformations called the staggered and eclipsed conformations.
Three different views of these are shown below.

the two extreme conformations of ethane, staggered and eclipsed, each shown from
three different viewpoints

staggered:

side view end-on view

eclipsed:

You can see why the conformations have these names by looking at the end-on views in the
diagram. In the eclipsed case the near C–H bonds completely block the view of the far bonds,
just as in a solar eclipse the Moon blocks the Sun as seen from the Earth. In the staggered conformation, the far C–H bonds appear in the gaps between the near C–H bonds—the bonds are
staggered.
Chemists often want to draw these two conformations quickly and two different methods
are commonly used, each with its own merits. In the fi rst method, shown on the right, we
simply draw the side view of the molecule and use wedged and hashed lines to show bonds not
in the plane of the paper (as you saw in Chapter 14). Particular attention must be paid to
which of the bonds are in the plane and which go into and out of the plane.
In the second method we draw the end-on view, looking along the C–C bond. This view is
known as a Newman projection, and Newman projections are subject to a few conventions:

 - The carbon atom nearer the viewer is at the junction of the front three bonds.

 - The carbon further away (which can’t in fact be seen in the end-on view) is represented
by a large circle. This makes the perspective inaccurate, but this doesn’t matter.

- Picturing dihedral angles is
sometimes hard—one way to
do it is to imagine the two C–H
bonds drawn on two facing
pages of a book. The dihedral
angle is then the angle between
the pages, measured
perpendicular to the spine.
See Chapter 31.


The staggered and eclipsed conformations of ethane are not identical in energy: the staggered conformation is lower in energy than the eclipsed by 12 kJ mol[−][1], the value of the rotational barrier. Of course, there are other possible conformations too with energies in between
these extremes, and we can plot a graph to show the change in energy of the system as the
C–C bond rotates. We defi ne the dihedral angle, θ (sometimes called the torsion angle), to be
the angle between a C–H bond at the nearer carbon and a C–H bond at the far carbon. In the
staggered conformation, θ = 60° whilst in the eclipsed conformation, θ = 0°.
The energy level diagram shows the staggered conformation as a potential energy minimum whilst the eclipsed conformation represents an energy maximum. This means that the
eclipsed conformation is not a stable conformation since any slight rotation will lead to a
conformation lower in energy. The molecule will actually spend the vast majority of its time
in a staggered or nearly staggered conformation and only briefl y pass through the eclipsed
conformation en route to another staggered conformation.

But why is the eclipsed conformation higher in energy than the staggered conformation?
There are two reasons. The fi rst is that the electrons in the bonds repel each other and this
repulsion is at a maximum when the bonds are aligned in the eclipsed conformation. The second is that there may be some stabilizing interaction between the C–H σ bonding orbital on
one carbon and the C–H σ* antibonding orbital on the other carbon, which is greatest when
the two orbitals are exactly parallel: this only happens in the staggered conformation. The
same effects—repulsion between fi lled orbitals (a form of steric effect, see p. 129) and stabilization by donation into antibonding orbitals—govern the favoured conformations about all
rotating bonds.

###### Conformations of propane

Propane is the next simplest hydrocarbon. Before we consider what conformations are possible for propane we should fi rst look at its geometry. The C–C–C bond angle is not 109.5° (the
tetrahedral angle, see Chapters 2 and 4) as we might expect, but 112.4°. Consequently, the
H–C–H bond angle on the central carbon is smaller than the ideal angle of 109.5°, only
106.1°. This does not necessarily mean that the two methyl groups on the central carbon clash
in some way, but instead that two C–C bonds repel each other more than two C–H bonds do.
As in the case of ethane, two extreme conformations of propane are possible—in one the
C–H and C–C bonds are staggered, in the other they are eclipsed.

The rotational barrier is now slightly higher than for ethane: 14 kJ mol[−][1] as compared to
12 kJ mol[−][1]. This again refl ects the greater repulsion of electrons in the coplanar bonds in the
eclipsed conformation rather than any steric interactions. The energy graph for bond rotation in
propane would look exactly the same as that for ethane except that the barrier is now 14 kJ mol[−][1].

###### Conformations of butane

With butane things start to get slightly more complicated. Now we have effectively replaced
two hydrogen atoms in ethane by larger methyl groups. These are large enough to get in the
way of each other, and steric repulsion becomes a signifi cant contribution to the rotational
energy barriers. However, the main complication is that, as we rotate about the central C–C
bond, not all the staggered conformations are the same, and neither are all the eclipsed conformations. The six conformations that butane can adopt as the central C–C bond is rotated
in 60° intervals are shown below. The green Me group and the brown hydrogens are rotating
while the substituents on the other carbon atom remain still.

- Notice that when we draw
the eclipsed conformation we
have to offset the front and
back bonds slightly to see the
substituents clearly. In reality,
one is right behind the other.

Look closely at these different conformations. The conformations with dihedral angles 60°
and 300° are actually mirror images of each other, as are the conformations with angles 120°
and 240°. This means that we really only have four different maxima or minima in energy as
we rotate about the central C–C bond: two types of eclipsed conformation, which will represent maxima in the energy–rotation graph, and two types of staggered conformation, which
will represent minima. These four different conformations have names, shown in the bottom
row of the diagram. In the syn-periplanar and anti-periplanar conformations the two C–Me
bonds lie in the same plane; in the synclinal (or gauche) and anticlinal conformations they
slope towards (syn) or away from (anti) one another.


-----

Before we draw the energy–rotation graph, let’s just stop and think what it might look like.
Each of the eclipsed conformations will be energy maxima but the syn-periplanar conformation (θ = 0°) will be higher in energy than the two anticlinal conformations (θ = 120° and
240°): in the syn-periplanar conformation two methyl groups are eclipsing each other whereas
in the anticlinal conformations each methyl group is eclipsing only a hydrogen atom. The
staggered conformations will be energy minima but the two methyl groups are furthest from
each other in the anti-periplanar conformation so this will be a slightly lower minimum than
the two synclinal (gauche) conformations.

- The rotation is very rapid
indeed: the barrier of 20 kJ
mol[−1] corresponds to a rate at
room temperature of 2 × 10[9]
s[−1]. This is far too fast for the
different conformers to be
detected by NMR (see p. 363):
the NMR spectrum of butane
shows only one set of signals
representing an average of all
the conformations.


As in ethane, the eclipsed conformations are not stable since any rotation leads to a more
stable conformation. The staggered conformations are stable since they each lie in a potential
energy well. The anti-periplanar conformation, with the two methyl groups opposite each
other, is the most stable of all. We can therefore think of a butane molecule as rapidly interconverting between synclinal and anti-periplanar conformations, passing quickly through
the eclipsed conformations on the way. The eclipsed conformations are energy maxima, and
therefore represent the transition states for interconversion between conformations.
If we managed to slow down the rapid interconversions in butane (by cooling to very low
temperature, for example), we would be able to isolate the three stable conformations—the
anti-periplanar and the two synclinal conformations. These different stable conformations of
butane are some sort of isomers. They are called conformational isomers or conformers for short.



- **Conformations and conformers**

**Butane can exist in an infi nite number of conformations (we have chosen to show only the six**
**most signifi cant) but has only three conformers (potential energy minima)—the two synclinal**
**(gauche) conformations and the anti-periplanar conformation.**



- You will see why such
detailed conformational analysis
of acyclic compounds is so
important in Chapter 17 on
eliminations, where the products
of elimination reactions can be
explained only by considering
the conformations of the
reactants and the transition
states. But fi rst we want to use
these ideas to explain another
branch of organic chemistry—
the conformation of ring
structures.


Up to now, we haven’t given an entirely accurate impression of rings. We have been drawing
them all as though they were planar, although this is actually not the case. In this section you
will learn how to draw rings more accurately and to understand the properties of the different
conformations adopted.
If we assume that in fully saturated carbocyclic rings each carbon is sp[3] hybridized, then
each bond angle would ideally be 109.5°. However, in a planar ring, the carbon atoms don’t


You now have a more thorough explanation of the zig-zag arrangement of carbon chains,
fi rst introduced in Chapter 2 when we showed you how to draw molecules realistically. This
is the shape you get if you allow all the C–C bonds to take up the anti-periplanar conformation, and it will be the most stable conformation for any linear alkane.

###### Ring strain


-----

have the luxury of choosing their bond angles: internal angle depends only on the number of
atoms in the ring. If this angle differs from the ideal 109.5°, there will be some sort of strain
in the molecule. This is best seen in the picture below, where the atoms are forced planar. The
more strained the molecules are, the more the bonds curve—in a strain-free molecule, the
bonds are straight.

All internal angles 109.5°



- We have used ring strain a
number of times to explain the
reactivity of cyclic molecules
(p. 352).


Notice how in the smaller rings the bonds curve outwards, whilst in the larger rings the
bonds curve inwards. The table gives values for the internal angles for regular planar polygons
and an indication of the strain per carbon atom due to the deviation of this angle from the
ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5°.
These data are best presented as a graph, and the ring strain per carbon atom in planar rings
for ring sizes up to 17 are shown on the next page. Whether the bonds are strained inwards or
outwards is not important so only the magnitude of the strain is shown.
From these fi gures (represented in the graph on p. 368), note:

 - These are calculated data for hypothetical planar rings. As you will see, real rings are
rather different.

through a four-membered ring and reaches a minimum for a fi ve-membered ring.


a A measure of strain per carbon atom.



 - The calculated ring strain increases again (although less rapidly) as the rings get larger
after the minimum at 5.

But what we really need is a measure of the strain in actual compounds, not just a theoretical prediction in planar rings, so that we can compare this with the theoretical angle strain.
A good measure of the strain in real rings is obtained using heats of combustion. Look at the
following heats of combustion for some straight-chain alkanes. What is striking is that the
difference between any two in the series is very nearly constant at around –660 kJ mol[−][1].



- A similar measurement was
used in Chapter 7 to
demonstrate the stabilization of
benzene due to its aromaticity.


Heats of combustion for some straight-chain alkanes

nonane 7 6171 660

decane 8 6829 658

undecane 9 7487 658

dodecane 10 8148 661


If we assume (as is reasonable) that there is no strain in the straight-chain alkanes, then each
extra methylene group, –CH2–, contributes on average an extra 658.7 kJ mol[−][1] to the heat of
combustion for the alkane. A cycloalkane (CH2)n is simply a number of methylene groups
joined together. If the cycloalkane is strain-free, then its heat of combustion should be n × 658.7
kJ mol[−][1]. If, however, there is some strain in the ring that makes the ring less stable (that is,
raises its energy) then more energy is given out on combustion. Now, let’s put all this together
in a graph showing, for each ring size: (a) angle strain per CH2 group and (b) heat of combustion per CH2 group.

Ring size


Points to notice in graph above:

- The greatest strain by far is in the three-membered ring, cyclopropane (n = 3).



- The strain decreases rapidly with ring size but reaches a minimum for cyclohexane,
_not cyclopentane as you might have predicted from the angle calculations._

- The strain then increases but not nearly as quickly as the angle calculation suggested:
it reaches a maximum at around n = 9 and then decreases once more.


Chemists class rings as small,
normal, medium, or large
depending on their size.

small, n = 3 or 4
normal, n = 5, 6, or 7
medium, n = 8 to about 14
large, n > about 14



- The strain does not go on increasing as ring size increases but instead remains roughly
constant after about n = 14.

- Cyclohexane (n = 6) and the larger cycloalkanes (n ≥ 14) all have heats of combustion
per –CH2 group of around 658 kJ mol[−][1], the same value as that of a –CH2 group in a
straight-chain alkane, that is, they are essentially strain-free.


You might ask yourself some questions now:


This is because these different
classes all have different properties and synthetic routes to making them. The groupings are
evident in the graph above.


Why are six-membered rings and large rings virtually strain-free?
Why is there still some strain in fi ve-membered rings even though the bond angles in a
planar structure are almost 109.5°?

The answer to both these questions, as you may already have guessed, is that the assumption that the rings are planar is simply not correct. It is easy to see how large rings can fold up
into many different conformations as easily as acyclic compounds do. It is less clear to predict
what happens in six-membered rings.


###### Six-membered rings

If you were to join six tetrahedral carbon atoms together, you would probably fi nd that you
ended up with a shape like this.



- By far the easiest way to get
to grips with these different
shapes is by building models.
We strongly recommend you
do this!


All the carbon atoms are certainly not in the same plane, and there is no strain because all
the bond angles are 109.5°. If you squash the model against the desk, forcing the atoms to lie
in the same plane, it springs back into this shape as soon as you let go. If you view the model
from one side (the second picture above) you will notice that four carbon atoms lie in the same
plane, with the fi fth above the plane and the sixth below it (although it’s important to realize
that all six are identical—you can check this by rotating your model). The slightly overly
imaginative name for this conformation—the chair conformation—derives from this view.


-----

There is another conformation of cyclohexane that you might have made that looks like this.

This conformation is known as the boat conformation. In this conformation there are still
four carbon atoms in one plane, but the other two are both above this plane. Now all the carbon atoms are not the same—the four in the plane are different from the ones above. However,
this is not a stable conformation of cyclohexane, even though there is no bond angle strain
(all the angles are 109.5°). In order to understand why not, we must go back a few steps and
answer our other question: why is cyclopentane strained even though a planar conformation
has virtually no angle strain?

###### Smaller rings (three, four, and fi ve members)

The three carbon atoms in cyclopropane must lie in a plane since it is always possible to draw
a plane through any three points. All the C–C bond lengths are the same, which means that
the three carbon atoms are at the corners of an equilateral triangle. From the large heat of
combustion per methylene group (p. 368) we know that there is considerable strain in this
molecule. Most of this is due to the bond angles deviating so greatly from the ideal tetrahedral
value of 109.5°. Most—but not all. If we view along one of the C–C bonds we can see a further
cause of strain—all the C–H bonds are eclipsed.

viewing cyclopropane along a C–C bond

The eclipsed conformation of ethane is an energy maximum and any rotation leads to a
more stable conformation. In cyclopropane it is not possible to rotate any of the C–C bonds
and so all the C–H bonds are forced to eclipse their neighbours. In fact, in any planar conformation all the C–H bonds will be eclipsed with their neighbours. In cyclobutane, the ring
distorts from a planar conformation in order to reduce the eclipsing interactions, even though
this reduces the bond angles further and so increases the bond angle strain. Cyclobutane
adopts a puckered or ‘wing-shaped’ conformation.

-----

'open envelope'
conformation of
cyclopentane


This explains why cyclopentane is not entirely strain-free even though in a planar conformation the C–C–C bond angles are close to 109.5°. The heat of combustion data give us an
indication of the total strain in the molecule, not just the contribution of angle strain. There
is strain in planar cyclopentane caused by the eclipsing of adjacent C–H bonds. As in cyclobutane, the ring distorts to reduce the eclipsing interactions but this increases the angle
strain. Whatever happens, there is always going to be some strain in the system. The minimum energy conformation adopted is a balance of the two opposing effects. Cyclopentane
adopts a shape approximating to an ‘open envelope’, with four C atoms in a plane and one
above or below it. The atoms in the ring rapidly take turns not to be in the plane, and cyclopentanes have much less well-defi ned conformational properties than cyclohexanes, to
which we shall now return.

###### A closer look at cyclohexane

The heats of combustion data on p. 368 show that cyclohexane is virtually strain-free. This
must mean that not only is there no angle strain, but there is also no strain from eclipsing
interactions either. A model of the chair conformation of cyclohexane including all the
hydrogen atoms looks like this.



- We shall consider the
conformations, and reactions, of
cyclopentanes in Chapter 32.

The view along two of the C–C bonds clearly shows that there are no eclipsing C–H bonds
in the chair conformation of cyclohexane—in fact, all the bonds are fully staggered, giving
the lowest energy possible. This is why cyclohexane is strain-free. Contrast this with the boat
conformation. Now four pairs of C–H bonds are eclipsed, and there is a particularly bad interaction between the ‘fl agstaff’ C–H bonds.

This explains why the boat conformation is much less important than the chair conformation. Even though both are free from angle strain, the eclipsing interactions in the boat conformation make it approximately 25 kJ mol[−][1] higher in energy than the chair conformation. In
fact, as we shall see later, the boat conformation represents an energy maximum in cyclohexane whilst the chair conformation is an energy minimum. Earlier we saw how the eclipsing
interactions in planar cyclobutane and cyclopentane could be reduced by distortion of the
ring. The same is true for the boat conformation of cyclohexane. The eclipsing interactions can
be relieved slightly if the two ‘side’ C–C bonds twist relative to each other.

- A local energy minimum
is the bottom of the potential
energy well, but not necessarily
the deepest possible well, which
is the global energy
**minimum. Small changes in**
conformation will increase the
energy, although a large change
may be able to decrease the
energy further. As an example,
the synclinal (gauche)
conformation of butane is a
local energy minimum; the antiperiplanar conformation is the
global energy minimum.


This twisting gives rise to a slightly different conformation of cyclohexane called the twist**boat conformation, which, although not as low in energy as the chair form, is lower in**
energy (by 4 kJ mol[−][1]) than the boat form and is a local energy minimum, as we shall see later.
Cyclohexane has two stable conformers, the chair and the twist-boat. The chair form is
approximately 21 kJ mol[−][1] lower in energy than the twist-boat form.

###### Axial and equatorial

Take another look at the chair conformation on p. 368. All six carbon atoms are identical, but
there are two types of protons—one type stick either vertically up or down and are called axial
hydrogen atoms; the other sort stick out sideways and are called equatorial hydrogen atoms.
As you go round the ring, notice that each of the CH2 groups has one hydrogen sticking up and
one sticking down. However, all the ‘up’ ones alternate between axial and equatorial, as do all
the ‘down’ ones.



- Compare the equator and
axis of the Earth: equatorial
bonds are around the equator of
the molecule. Note the spelling
(not equitorial!).

Before going any further, it’s important that you learn how to draw cyclohexane properly.
Without cluttering the structure with Cs and Hs, a chemist would draw cyclohexane as one of
these three structures.

A B C

Up to now, we have simply used the hexagon A to represent cyclohexane. We shall see that,
whilst this is the least informative of the three, it is nonetheless still useful. The more informative structures B and C (which are actually just different views of the same molecule) take
some practice to draw properly, but you need to be able to draw convincing cyclohexanes and
it is worth taking the time to learn how to now.

###### Guidelines for drawing cyclohexane

**The carbon skeleton**

Trying to draw the chair conformation of cyclohexane in one continuous line can lead to some
dreadful diagrams. The easiest way to draw a chair conformation is by starting off with one end.

Next draw in two parallel lines of equal length.

At this stage, the top of the new line should be level with the top of the original pair.

Finally, the last two lines should be added. These lines should be parallel to the fi rst pair of
lines as shown and the lowest points should also be level.

these lines should be parallel


-----

**Adding the hydrogen atoms**

This is often the trickiest part. Just remember that you are trying to make each of the carbon
atoms look tetrahedral. (Note that we don’t normally use wedged and hashed bonds in these
chair-shaped diagrams; otherwise things get really messy.)
The axial bonds are relatively easy to draw in. They should all be vertically aligned and
alternate up and down all round the ring.

###### The ring inversion (fl ipping) of cyclohexane

Given that this chair conformer is the preferred conformation for cyclohexane, what would
you expect its [13]C NMR spectrum to look like? All six carbon atoms are the same so there
should only be one signal (and indeed there is, at 25.2 ppm). But what about the [1]H NMR spectrum? The two different sorts of protons (axial and equatorial) ought to resonate at different
frequencies, so two signals should be seen (each with coupling to neighbouring protons). In
fact, there is only one resonance in the proton spectrum, at 1.40 ppm. In a monosubstituted
cyclohexane there should be two isomers detectable—one with the substituent axial, the other
with the substituent equatorial. But again at room temperature only one set of signals is seen.

This changes when the NMR spectrum is run at low temperature. Now two isomers are visible, and this gives us a clue as to what is happening: the two isomers are conformers that interconvert—rapidly at room temperature, but more slowly when the temperature is lowered.
Recall that NMR does not distinguish between the three different stable conformers of butane
(two synclinal and one anti-periplanar) because they are all rapidly interconverting so fast that
only an average is seen. The same happens with cyclohexane—just by rotating bonds (that is,
without breaking any!) cyclohexane can ring invert or ‘fl ip’. After ring inversion has taken
place, all the bonds that were axial are now equatorial and vice versa.
The whole inversion process can be broken down into the conformations shown below. The
green arrows show the direction in which the individual carbon atoms should move in order
to get to the next conformation.

to remind you again of Chapter

the conversion of one chair to

minima are energy maxima,
which are the transition states
for the process. The progress of
the ring-fl ipping ‘reaction’ is
shown along an arbitrary
‘reaction coordinate’.


-----

It’s clear from the diagram that the barrier to ring inversion of cyclohexane is 43 kJ mol[−][1], a
rate at 25°C of about 2 × 10[5] s[−][1]. Ring inversion also interconverts the axial and equatorial
protons, so these are also exchanging at a rate of 2 × 10[5] s[−][1] at 25 °C—too fast for them to be
detected individually by NMR, which is why they appear as an averaged signal.

###### Rates and spectroscopy

NMR spectrometers behave like cameras with a shutter speed of about 1/1000 s. Anything happening faster than that,
and we get a blurred picture; things happening more slowly give a sharp picture. In fact, a more exact number for the
‘shutter speed’ of an NMR machine (not a real shutter speed—just fi guratively speaking!) is given by the equation

k = π∆ν / 2 = 2.22 × ∆ν

where k is the fastest exchange rate that still gives individual signals and Δν is the separation of those signals in the
NMR spectrum measured in hertz. For example, on a 400 MHz spectrometer, two signals separated by 0.5 ppm are
100 Hz apart, so any process exchanging with a rate slower than 222 s[−1] will still allow the NMR machine to show two
separate signals; if they exchange with a rate faster than 222 s[−1] only an averaged signal will be seen.
The equation above holds for any spectroscopic method, provided we think in terms of differences between signals or
peaks measured in hertz. So, for example, a difference between two IR absorptions of 100 cm[−1] can be represented as
a wavelength of 0.01 cm (1 × 10[−4] m) or a frequency of 3 × 10[12] s[−1]. IR can detect changes happening a lot faster than
NMR can—its ‘shutter speed’ is of the order of one-trillionth of a second.

###### Substituted cyclohexanes

In a monosubstituted cyclohexane, there can exist two different chair conformers: one with
the substituent axial, the other with it equatorial. The two chair conformers will be in rapid
equilibrium (by the process we have just described) but they will not have the same energy. In
almost all cases, the conformer with the substituent axial is higher in energy, which means there
will be less of this form present at equilibrium.

For example, in methylcyclohexane (X=CH3), the conformer with the methyl group axial is
7.3 kJ mol[−][1] higher in energy than the conformer with the methyl group equatorial. This
energy difference corresponds to a 20:1 ratio of equatorial:axial conformers at 25 °C.
There are two reasons why the axial conformer is higher in energy than the equatorial conformer. The fi rst is that the axial conformer is destabilized by the repulsion between the axial
group X and the two axial hydrogen atoms on the same side of the ring. This interaction is
known as the 1,3-diaxial interaction. As the group X gets larger, this interaction becomes
more severe and there is less of the conformer with the group axial. The second reason is that

percentages of equatorial conformer for methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, and phenylcyclohexanes are all 95% or more. Looking at the equilibrium constants gives a much
clearer picture.

 - The amount of equatorial conformer present does increase in the order
Me < Et < _i-Pr <_ _t-Bu, but perhaps not quite as expected. The ethyl group must be_
physically larger than a methyl group but there is hardly any difference in the
equilibrium constants. The increase in the proportion of equatorial conformer on going
from Et to i-Pr is only a factor of two, but for t-butylcyclohexane it is estimated that
there is about 3000 times more of the equatorial conformer than the axial conformer.

 - The same anomaly occurs with the methoxy group—there is a much greater
proportion of the conformer with a methoxy group axial than with a methyl group
axial. This is despite the fact that a methoxy group is physically larger than a methyl
group.

 - The equilibrium constant does not depend on the actual size of the substituent, but
rather its interaction with the neighbouring axial hydrogens. In the axial conformer
of methylcyclohexane there is a direct interaction between the methyl group and the
axial hydrogen atoms.

 - In the case of the methoxy group, the oxygen acts as link and removes the methyl
group away from the ring, lessening the interaction.

 - The groups Me, Et, i-Pr, and t-Bu all need to point some atom towards the other axial
hydrogens, and for Me, Et, and i-Pr this can be H.

 - Only for t-Bu must a methyl group be pointing straight at the axial hydrogens, so t-Bu
has a much larger preference for the equatorial position than the other alkyl groups.
In fact, the interactions between an axial t-Bu group and the axial hydrogen atoms are
so severe that the group virtually always stays in the equatorial position. As we shall
see later, this can be very useful.

###### What happens with more than one substituent on the ring?

When there are two or more substituents on the ring, stereoisomerism is possible. For example, there are two isomers of 1,4-cyclohexanediol—in one (the cis isomer) both the substituents are either above or below the cyclohexane ring; in the other (the _trans isomer) one_
hydroxyl group is above the ring whilst the second is below. For a _cis 1,4-disubstituted_
cyclohexane with both the substituents the same, ring inversion leads to a second identical
conformation, while for the trans confi guration there is one conformation with both groups
axial and one with both groups equatorial.

The chair-structure diagrams contain much more information than the simple ‘hexagon’
diagrams that we have used up to now. The former show both confi guration and conformation—
they show which stereoisomer (cis or trans) we are talking about and also (for the trans compound) the conformation adopted (diaxial or the more stable diequatorial). In contrast, the
simpler hexagon diagrams carry no information about the conformation—only information
about which isomer we are dealing with. This can be useful because it enables us to talk about
one confi guration of a compound without specifying the conformation. When you are solving a problem requiring conformational diagrams to predict the confi guration of a product,
always start and fi nish with a confi gurational (hexagon) drawing.
The chair conformer of cis-1,4-disubstituted cyclohexane has one substituent equatorial,
the other axial. This will not necessarily be the case for other substitution patterns, for example the chair conformer of a cis-1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane has either both substituents
axial or both equatorial. Remember, the ‘cis’ and ‘trans’ prefi xes merely indicate that both
groups are on the same ‘side’ of the cyclohexane ring. Whether the substituents are both
axial/equatorial or one axial and the other equatorial depends on the substitution pattern.
Each time you meet a molecule, draw the conformation or make a model to fi nd out which
bonds are axial and which are equatorial.

What if the two substituents on the ring are different? For the cis-1,3-disubstituted example
above, there is no problem because the favoured conformation will still be the one that
places these two different substituents equatorial. But when one substituent is axial and the
other equatorial (as they happen to be in the trans diastereoisomer above) the preferred conformation will depend on what those substituents are. In general, the favoured conformation
will place the maximum number of substituents equatorial. If both conformations have the
same number of equatorial substituents, the one with the larger substituent equatorial will
win out, and the smaller group will be forced to be axial. Various possibilities are included in
the examples below.



- It is not always easy to
decide if an equatorial
substituent is ‘up’ or ‘down’.
The key is to compare it with its
axial partner on the same C
atom—axial substituents very
clearly point ‘up’ or ‘down’. If
the axial partner is ‘up’, the
equatorial substituent must be
‘down’ and vice versa.

This is only a guideline, and in many cases it is not easy to be sure. Instead of concerning
ourselves with these uncertainties, we shall move on to some differentially substituted
cyclohexanes for which it is absolutely certain which conformer is preferred.

###### Locking groups—t-butyl groups, decalins, and steroids

We have already seen how a t-butyl group always prefers an equatorial position in a ring. This
makes it very easy to decide which conformation the two different compounds below will
adopt.

It is also possible to lock the conformation of a cyclohexane ring by joining another ring to it.
Decalin is two cyclohexane rings fused at a common C–C bond. Two diastereoisomers are
possible, depending on whether the hydrogen atoms at the ring junction are cis or trans. For
_cis-decalin, the second ring has to join the fi rst so that it is axial at one point of attachment_
and equatorial at the other; for trans-decalin, the second ring can be joined to the fi rst in the
equatorial position at both attachment points.

When a cyclohexane ring inverts, the substituents that were equatorial become axial and
vice versa. This is fi ne for cis-decalin, which has an axial–equatorial junction, but it means
that ring inversion is not possible for trans-decalin. For trans-decalin to invert, the junction
would have to become axial–axial, and it’s not possible to link the axial positions to form a
six-membered ring. Cis-decalin, on the other hand, ring inverts easily.


###### Flipping cis-decalin: not so diffi cult once you know how

If you fi nd it hard to visualize the ring inversion of cis-decalin, you are not alone! The best way to think about it is to
ignore the second ring until the very end: just concentrate on what happens to one ring (black in this diagram), the
hydrogens at the ring junction, and the (orange) bonds next to these hydrogens that form the ‘stumps’ of the second
ring. Flip the black ring, and the ‘stumps’, and the hydrogens swap from axial to equatorial and vice versa. Draw the
result, but don’t fi ll in the second ring yet or it will usually just come out looking like a fl at hexagon (as in diagram A).
Instead, rotate the complete (black) ring 60° about a vertical axis so that both of the orange ‘stumps’ can form part of
a chair, which can now be fi lled in (diagram B). To make a chair (and not a hexagon) they must be pointing in a convergent direction, as the orange bonds are in B but not A.

###### Steroids

Steroids are an important class of compounds occurring in all animals and plants, which have
many important functions from regulating growth (anabolic steroids) and sex drive (all sex
hormones are steroids) to acting as a self-defence mechanism in plants, frogs, and even sea
cucumbers. A steroid is defi ned by its structure: all steroids contain a basic carbon framework
consisting of four fused rings—three cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring—labelled
and joined together as shown in the margin.
Just as in the decalin system, each ring junction could be cis or trans, but it turns out that all
steroids have all _trans-junctions except where rings A and B join, which is sometimes_ _cis._
Examples are cholestanol (all trans) and coprostanol (A and B fused cis).

Because steroids (even those with a _cis A–B ring junction) are essentially substituted_
_trans-decalins, they can’t ring-fl ip. This means, for example, that the hydroxyl group in_
cholestanol is held equatorial on ring A while the hydroxyl group in coprostanol is held
axial on ring A. The steroid skeleton really is remarkably stable—samples of sediment
1.5 × 10[9] years old have been found to contain steroids still with the same ring-junction
stereochemistry.

###### Axially and equatorially substituted rings react differently

We shall be using ring structures throughout the rest of the book, and you will learn how their
conformation affects their chemistry extensively. In many reactions of six-membered rings,
the outcome may depend on whether a functional group is axial or equatorial. We shall conclude this chapter with two examples in which a functional group will be held in its axial or
equatorial position by ‘locking’ the ring using a t-butyl group or a fused ring system such as
_trans-decalin._
In the last chapter we looked at two mechanisms for nucleophilic substitution: SN1 and SN2.
We saw that the SN2 reaction involved an inversion at the carbon centre. Recall that the
incoming nucleophile had to attack the σ* orbital of the C–X bond. This meant that it had to
approach the leaving group directly from behind, leading to inversion of confi guration.


It was a desire to explain the
reactions of steroids that led Sir
Derek Barton (1918–98) to discover, in the 1940s and 1950s,
the principles of conformational
analysis described in this chapter. It was for this work that he
shared the Nobel Prize for
Chemistry in 1969.



- These locking groups work
because the t-butyl group can
never be axial (p. 375) and the
trans-decalin can never ring-fl ip
(p. 378).

What do you think would happen if a cyclohexane derivative underwent an SN2 reaction?
If the conformation of the molecule is fi xed by a locking group, the inversion mechanism of

end up equatorial and vice versa.

Substitution reactions are not very common for substituted cyclohexanes. The electrophilic
carbon in a cyclohexane ring is a secondary centre—in the last chapter we saw that secondary
centres do not react well via either SN1 or SN2 mechanisms (p. 347). To encourage an SN2
mechanism, we need a good attacking nucleophile and a good leaving group. One such example is shown—the substitution of tosylate by PhS[−].

The substitution of an axial substituent proceeds faster than the substitution of an equatorial substituent. There are several contributing factors making up this rate difference, but the
most important is the direction of approach of the nucleophile. The nucleophile must attack
the σ* of the leaving group, that is, directly behind the C–X bond. In the case of an equatorially substituted compound, this line of attack is hindered by the (green) axial hydrogens—it
passes directly through the region of space they occupy. For an axial leaving group, the direction of attack is parallel with the (orange) axial hydrogens anti-periplanar to the leaving
group, and approach is much less hindered.

We must assume that this holds even for simple unsubstituted cyclohexanes, and that substitution reactions of cyclohexyl bromide, for example, occur mainly on the minor, axial
conformer. This slows down the reaction because before it can react, the prevalent equatorial
conformer must fi rst fl ip to the axial.
If this fl ip to an axial leaving group is not possible, it may be that the reaction just won’t
happen at all. This is exactly what happens in a trans-decalin. There are two diastereoisomers
of this simple substituted trans-decalin: one with an equatorial and one with an axial leaving
group (X could be Br, OTs, etc.).

Attack by a nucleophile on the compound with the axial leaving group is straightforward.
The nucleophile can approach along the axis of the C–X bond and normal SN2 reaction occurs
with inversion—the product is the equatorial compound. The equatorial leaving group, on
the other hand, would require the nucleophile to approach through the middle of the molecule and that cannot be achieved. A totally different reaction occurs—a rearrangement that
you will meet in Chapter 36.

###### To conclude...

You may wonder why we have spent most of this chapter looking at six-membered rings,
ignoring other ring sizes almost totally. Apart from the fact that six is the most widespread
ring size in organic chemistry, the reactions of six-membered rings are also the easiest
to explain and to understand. The conformational principles we have outlined for sixmembered rings (relief of ring strain, staggered favoured over eclipsed, equatorial favoured
over axial, direction of attack) hold, in modifi ed form, for other ring sizes as well. These other
rings are less well behaved than six-membered rings because they lack the well-defi ned strainfree conformations that cyclohexane is blessed with. We shall now leave stereochemistry in
rings for some time, but we come back to these more diffi cult rings—and how to tame them—
in two chapters on stereochemistry in cyclic compounds, Chapters 31 and 32.

###### Substitution and elimination

Substitution reactions of t-butyl halides, you will recall from Chapter 15, invariably follow the
SN1 mechanism. In other words, the rate-determining step of their substitution reactions is
unimolecular—it involves only the alkyl halide. This means that, no matter what the nucleophile is, the reaction goes at the same rate. You can’t speed this SN1 reaction up, for example,
by using hydroxide instead of water, or even by increasing the concentration of hydroxide.
You’d be wasting your time, we said (see p. 332).

The reaction stops being a substitution and an alkene is formed instead. Overall, HBr has
been lost from the alkyl halide, and the reaction is called an elimination.
In this chapter we will talk about the mechanisms of elimination reactions—as in the
case of substitutions, there is more than one mechanism for eliminations. We will compare eliminations with substitutions—either reaction can happen from almost identical
starting materials, and you will learn how to predict which is the more likely. Much of
the mechanistic discussion relates very closely to Chapter 15, and we suggest that you
make sure you understand all of the points in that chapter before tackling this one. This
chapter will also tell you about uses for elimination reactions. Apart from a brief look at
the Wittig reaction in Chapter 11, this is the fi rst time you have met a way of making simple alkenes.

###### Elimination happens when the nucleophile attacks hydrogen instead of carbon

The elimination reaction of t-butyl bromide happens because the nucleophile is basic. You
will recall from Chapter 10 that there is some correlation between basicity and nucleophilicity: strong bases are usually good nucleophiles. Being a good nucleophile doesn’t get hydroxide anywhere in the substitution reaction because it doesn’t appear in the fi rst-order rate
equation. But being a good base does get it somewhere in the elimination reaction because
hydroxide is involved in the rate-determining step of the elimination, and so it appears in the
rate equation. This is the mechanism.

E2 elimination

two molecules rate = k[t-BuBr][HO[–]]
involved in the rate- **HO** **H** **HOH** **Br**
determining step **Br**

The hydroxide is behaving as a base because it is attacking the hydrogen atom, instead of
the carbon atom it would attack in a substitution reaction. The hydrogen atom is not
acidic, but proton removal can occur because bromide is a good leaving group. As the
hydroxide attacks, the bromide is forced to leave, taking with it the negative charge. Two
molecules—t-butyl bromide and hydroxide—are involved in the rate-determining step of
the reaction. This means that the concentrations of both appear in the rate equation,
which is therefore second-order and this mechanism for elimination is termed E2, for elimi_nation, bimolecular._

rate = _k2 [ -BuBr][HO ]t_ −

Now let’s look at another sort of elimination. We can approach it again by thinking about
another SN1 substitution reaction, the reverse of the one at the beginning of the chapter: an
alcohol is converted into an alkyl halide.

nucleophilic substitution of t-BuOH with HBr



- The correlation between
basicity and nucleophilicity is
best for attack at C=O. In
Chapter 15 you met examples of
nucleophiles that are good at
substitution at saturated carbon
(such as I[−], Br [−], PhS [−]) but that
are not strong bases.



- Note: No subscripts or
superscripts, just plain old E2.

_t-butanol_ _t-butyl bromide_

Bromide, the nucleophile, is not involved in the rate-determining step, so we know that the
rate of the reaction will be independent of the concentration of Br [−]. Indeed the fi rst step, to
form the cation, will happen just as fast even if there is no bromide at all. But what happens to
the carbocation in such a case? To fi nd out, we need to use an acid whose counterion is such
a weak nucleophile that it won’t even attack the positive carbon of the carbocation. Here is an
example—t-butanol in sulfuric acid doesn’t undergo substitution, but undergoes elimination
instead.

(2-methylpropene)

The HSO4− anion is not involved in the rate-determining formation of the carbocation, and
is also a very bad nucleophile, so it does not attack the C atom of the carbocation. Neither is
it basic, but you can see from the mechanism that it does behave as a base (that is, it removes
a proton). It does this only because it is even more feeble as a nucleophile. The rate equation
will not involve the concentration of HSO4−, and the rate-determining step is the same as that
in the SN1 reaction—unimolecular loss of water from the protonated t-BuOH. This elimination mechanism is therefore called E1.
We will shortly come back to these two mechanisms for elimination, plus a third, but it is
worth noting at this stage that the choice between E1 and E2 is not based on the same grounds
as the choice between SN1 and SN2: you have just seen both E1 and E2 elimination from a
substrate that would only undergo SN1. The difference between the two reactions was the
strength of the base, so fi rst we need to answer the question: when does a nucleophile start
behaving as a base?

###### Elimination in carbonyl chemistry

We have left detailed discussion of the formation of alkenes until this chapter, but we used the term ‘elimination’ in
Chapters 10 and 11 to describe the loss of a leaving group from a tetrahedral intermediate. For example, the fi nal steps
of acid-catalysed ester hydrolysis involve E1 elimination of ROH to leave a double bond: C=O rather than C=C.

###### How the nucleophile affects elimination versus substitution

 Basicity

You have just seen molecules bearing leaving groups being attacked at two distinct electrophilic sites: the carbon to which the leaving group is attached, and the hydrogen atoms on the
carbon adjacent to the leaving group. Attack at carbon leads to substitution; attack at hydrogen leads to elimination. Since strong bases attack protons, it is generally true that, the more
basic the nucleophile, the more likely that elimination is going to replace substitution as the
main reaction of an alkyl halide.
Here is an example of this idea at work: a weak base (EtOH) leads to substitution while a
strong base (ethoxide ion) leads to elimination.

###### Elimination, substitution, and hardness

We can also rationalize selectivity for elimination versus substitution, or attack on H versus attack on C in terms of hard
and soft electrophiles (p. 357). In an SN2 substitution, the carbon centre is a soft electrophile—it is essentially uncharged,
and with leaving groups such as halide the C–X σ* is a relatively low-energy LUMO. Substitution is therefore favoured
by nucleophiles whose HOMOs are best able to interact with this LUMO—in other words soft nucleophiles. In contrast,
the C–H σ* is higher in energy because the atoms are less electronegative. This, coupled with the hydrogen’s small size,
makes the C–H bond a hard electrophilic site, and as a result hard nucleophiles favour elimination.


###### Size

For a nucleophile, attacking a carbon atom means squeezing past its substituents—and even
for unhindered primary alkyl halides there is still one alkyl group attached. This is one of the
reasons that SN2 is so slow on hindered alkyl halides—the nucleophile has diffi culty getting
to the reactive centre. Getting at a more exposed hydrogen atom in an elimination reaction is
much easier, and this means that, as soon as we start using basic nucleophiles that are also
bulky, elimination becomes preferred over substitution, even for primary alkyl halides. One
of the best bases for promoting elimination and avoiding substitution is potassium _t-but-_
oxide. The large alkyl substituent makes it hard for the negatively charged oxygen to attack
carbon in a substitution reaction, but it has no problem attacking hydrogen.

###### Temperature

Temperature has an important role to play in deciding whether a reaction is an elimination or
a substitution. In an elimination, two molecules become three (count them). In a substitution, two molecules form two new molecules. The two reactions therefore differ in the change
in entropy during the reaction: ΔS is greater for elimination than for substitution. In Chapter
12, we discussed the equation



- This explanation is simplifi ed
because what matters is the rate
of the reaction, not the stability
of the products. A detailed
discussion is beyond the scope
of the book, but the general
argument still holds.


-----

∆G = ∆H − _T S∆_

This equation says that a reaction in which ΔS is positive becomes more favourable (ΔG
becomes more negative) at higher temperature. Eliminations should therefore be favoured at
high temperature, and this is indeed the case: most eliminations you will see are conducted
at room temperature or above.

**•** **Nucleophiles (or bases) that are bulky favour elimination over substitution.**

**•** **High temperatures favour elimination over substitution.**


###### E1 and E2 mechanisms

Now that you have seen a few examples of elimination reactions, it is time to return to our
discussion of the two mechanisms for elimination. To summarize what we have said so far:

 - E1 describes an elimination reaction (E) in which the rate-determining step is
unimolecular (1) and does not involve the base. The leaving group leaves in this step,
and the proton is removed in a separate second step.

- In E2 eliminations the loss of
the leaving group and removal
of the proton are concerted.



 - E2 describes an elimination (E) that has a bimolecular (2) rate-determining step that
must involve the base. Loss of the leaving group is simultaneous with removal of the
proton by the base.

There are a number of factors that affect whether an elimination goes by an E1 or E2 mechanism. One is immediately obvious from the rate equations: only the E2 is affected by the
concentration of base, so at high base concentration E2 is favoured. The rate of an E1 reaction
is not even affected by what base is present—so E1 is just as likely with weak as with strong
bases, while E2 goes faster with strong bases than weak ones: strong bases at whatever concentration will favour E2 over E1. If you see that a strong base is required for an elimination, it is
certainly an E2 reaction. Take the fi rst elimination in this chapter as an example.

**HO** **H** **HOH** **Br**

**Br**


With less hindered alkyl halides hydroxide would not be a good choice as a base for an
elimination because it is rather small and still very good at SN2 substitutions (and even with
tertiary alkyl halides, substitution outpaces elimination at low concentrations of hydroxide).
So what are good alternatives?


-----

We have already mentioned the bulky t-butoxide—ideal for promoting E2 as it’s both bulky
and a strong base (pKa of t-BuOH = 18). Here it is at work converting a dibromide to a diene
with two successive E2 eliminations. Since dibromides can be made from alkenes (you will see
how in the next chapter), this is a useful two-step conversion of an alkene to a diene.

The product of the next reaction is a ‘ketene acetal’. Unlike most acetals, this one can’t be
formed directly from ketene (ketene, CH2=C=O, is too unstable), so instead the acetal is made
by the usual method from bromoacetaldehyde and then HBr is eliminated using t-BuOK.

Among the most commonly used bases for converting alkyl halides to alkenes is one that
you met in Chapter 8: DBU. This base is an amidine—delocalization of one nitrogen’s lone
pair onto the other, and the resulting stabilization of the protonated amidinium ion, makes it
particularly basic, with a pKa (of the protonated amidine) of about 12.5. There is not much
chance of getting those voluminous fused rings into tight corners—so they pick off the easyto-reach protons rather than attacking carbon atoms in substitution reactions.

###### Substrate structure may allow E1

The fi rst elimination of the chapter (t-BuBr plus hydroxide) illustrates something very important: the starting material is a tertiary alkyl halide and would therefore substitute only by SN1,
but it can eliminate by either E2 (with strong bases) or E1 (with weak bases). The steric factors that
disfavour SN2 at hindered centres don’t exist for eliminations. Nonetheless, E1 can occur only
with substrates that can ionize to give relatively stable carbocations—tertiary, allylic, or benzylic alkyl halides, for example. Secondary alkyl halides may eliminate by E1, while primary
alkyl halides only ever eliminate by E2 because the primary carbocation required for E1 would
be too unstable. The chart below summarizes the types of substrate that can undergo E1—but
remember that any of these substrates, under the appropriate conditions (in the presence of
strong bases, for example), may also undergo E2. For completeness, we have also included in this
chart three alkyl halides that cannot eliminate by either mechanism simply because they do
not have any hydrogens to lose from carbon atoms adjacent to the leaving group.

Polar solvents also favour E1 reactions because they stabilize the intermediate car bocation.
E1 eliminations from alcohols in aqueous or alcohol solution are particularly common and
very useful. An acid catalyst is used to promote loss of water, and in dilute H2SO4, H3PO4, or HCl
the absence of good nucleophiles ensures that substitution does not compete. With phosphoric acid, for example, the secondary alcohol cyclohexanol gives cyclohexene.

**OH H3PO4, H2O**

**165 °C**

But the best E1 eliminations of all are with tertiary alcohols. The alcohols can be made using
the methods of Chapter 9: nucleophilic attack by an organometallic on a carbonyl compound.
Nucleophilic addition, followed by E1 elimination, is an excellent way of making this substituted
cyclohexene, for example. Note that the proton required in the fi rst step is recovered in the
last—the reaction requires only catalytic amounts of acid.

At the end of the last chapter you met some bicyclic structures. These sometimes pose problems for elimination reactions. For example, this compound will not undergo elimination by
either an E1 or an E2 mechanism.

We shall see shortly what the problem with E2 is, but for E1 the hurdle to be overcome is the
formation of a planar carbocation. The bicyclic structure prevents the bridgehead carbon
becoming planar so, although the cation would be tertiary, it is very high in energy and does
not form. You could say that the non-planar structure forces the cation to have an empty sp[3]
orbital instead of an empty p orbital, and we saw in Chapter 4 that it is always best to leave the
orbitals with the highest possible energy empty.


-----

###### Bredt’s rule

The impossibility of planar bridgehead carbons means that double bonds can almost never be formed to bridgehead
carbons in bicyclic systems. This principle is known as Bredt’s rule, but, as with all rules, it is much more important to
know the reason than to know the name, and Bredt’s rule is simply a consequence of the strain induced by a planar
bridgehead carbon.


###### The role of the leaving group

We haven’t yet been very adventurous with our choice of leaving groups for eliminations: all
you have seen so far are E2 from alkyl halides and E1 from protonated alcohols. This is deliberate: the vast majority of the two classes of eliminations use one of these two types of starting
materials. But since the leaving group is involved in the rate-determining step of both E1 and
E2, in general any good leaving group will lead to a fast elimination. You may, for example, see
amines acting as leaving groups in eliminations of quaternary ammonium salts.

Both E1 and E2 are possible, and from what you have read so far you should be able to spot
that there is one of each here: in the fi rst example, a stabilized cation cannot be formed (so E1
is impossible), but a strong base is used, allowing E2. In the second, a stabilized tertiary cation
could be formed (so either E1 or E2 might occur), but no strong base is present, so the mechanism must be E1.

You have just seen that hydroxyl groups can be turned into good leaving groups in acid, but
this is only useful for substrates that can react by E1 elimination. The hydroxyl group is never
a leaving group in E2 eliminations, since they have to be done in base. A strong base would
remove the proton from the OH group instead.



- **OH[−] is never a leaving group in an E2 reaction.**


For primary and secondary alcohols, the hydroxyl is best made into a leaving group for
elimination reactions by sulfonylation with _para-toluenesulfonyl chloride (tosyl chloride,_
TsCl) or methanesulfonyl chloride (mesyl chloride, MeSO2Cl or MsCl).

Toluenesulfonate esters (tosylates) can be made from alcohols (with TsCl, pyridine). We
introduced tosylates in Chapter 15 because they are good electrophiles for substitution reactions with non-basic nucleophiles. With strong bases such as _t-BuOK, NaOEt, or DBU they_
undergo very effi cient elimination reactions. Here are two examples.

Methanesulfonyl esters (or mesylates; Chapter 15) can be eliminated using DBU, but a good
way of using MsCl to convert alcohols to alkenes is to do the mesylation and elimination steps
in one go, using the same base (Et3N) for both. Here are two examples making biologically
important molecules. In the fi rst, the mesylate is isolated and then eliminated with DBU to give
a synthetic analogue of uracil, one of the nucleotide bases present in RNA. In the second, the
mesylate is formed and eliminated in the same step using Et3N, to give a precursor to a sugar
analogue.

The second example here involves (overall) the elimination of a tertiary alcohol—so why
couldn’t an acid-catalysed E1 reaction have been used? The problem here, nicely solved by
the use of the mesylate, is that the molecule contains an acid-sensitive acetal functional
group. An acid-catalysed reaction would also have risked eliminating methanol from the
other tertiary centre.

###### E1 reactions can be stereoselective

For some eliminations only one product is possible. For others, there may be a choice of two
(or more) alkene products that differ either in the location or stereochemistry of the double
bond. We shall now move on to discuss the factors that control the stereochemistry (geometry—cis or trans) and regiochemistry (that is, where the double bond is) of the alkenes, starting
with E1 reactions.

_E alkenes (and transition states leading to E alkenes) are usually lower in energy than Z alk-_
enes (and the transition states leading to them) for steric reasons: the substituents can get
further apart from one another. A reaction that can choose which it forms is therefore likely
to favour the formation of E alkenes. For alkenes formed by E1 elimination, this is exactly
what happens: the less hindered E alkene is favoured. Here is an example.


**OH**


**H2SO4**


**Ph**


**Ph** **Ph**

95% E alkene 5% Z alkene


In Chapter 39 we shall discuss
why the transition states for the
decomposition of high-energy
intermediates like carbocations are
very similar in structure to the
carbocations themselves.


The geometry of the product is determined at the moment that the proton is lost from the
intermediate carbocation. The new π bond can only form if the vacant p orbital of the carbocation and the breaking C–H bond are aligned parallel. In the example shown there are two
possible conformations of the carbocation with parallel orientations, but one is more stable
than the other because it suffers less steric hindrance. The same is true of the transition states
on the route to the alkenes—the one leading to the E alkene is lower in energy, and more E
alkene than Z alkene is formed. The process is stereoselective because the reaction chooses to
form predominantly one of two possible stereoisomeric products.

###### E1 reactions can be regioselective

We can use the same ideas when we think about E1 eliminations that can give more
than one regioisomeric alkene. Here is an example. The major product is the alkene that
has the more substituents because this alkene is the more stable of the two possible
products.


We will come back to the
most useful ways of controlling the
geometry of double bonds in
Chapter 27.

**OH**
**HBr, H2O**



- **More substituted alkenes are more stable.**


+

major product minor product


-----

This is quite a general principle. But why should it be true? The reason for this is related to
the reason why more substituted carbocations are more stable. In Chapter 15 we said that the
carbocation is stabilized when its empty p orbital can interact with the fi lled orbitals of parallel C–H and C–C bonds. The same is true of the π system of the double bond—it is stabilized when the empty π* antibonding orbital can interact with the fi lled orbitals of parallel
C–H and C–C bonds. The more C–C or C–H bonds there are, the more stable the alkene.



- This explanation of both
stereo and regioselectivity in E1
reactions is based on kinetic
arguments—which alkene forms
faster. But it is also true that
some E1 eliminations are
reversible: the alkenes may be
protonated in acid to re-form
carbocations, as you will see in
the next chapter. This
reprotonation allows the more
stable product to form
preferentially under
thermodynamic control. In any
individual case, it may not be
clear which is operating.
However, with E2 reactions,
which follow, only kinetic
control applies: E2 reactions are
never reversible.


The more substituted alkene is more stable, but this does not necessarily explain why it
is the one that forms faster. To do that, we should look at the transition states leading to
the two alkenes. Both form from the same carbocation, but which one we get depends on
which proton is lost. Removal of the proton on the right (brown arrow) leads to a transition state in which there is a monosubstituted double bond partly formed. Removal of the
proton on the left (orange arrow) leads to a partial double bond that is trisubstituted. This
is more stable—the transition state is lower in energy, and the more substituted alkene
forms faster.

###### E2 eliminations have anti-periplanar transition states

Although E1 reactions show some stereo and regioselectivity, the level of selectivity in E2
reactions can be much higher because of the more stringent demands on the transition
state for E2 elimination. In an E2 elimination, the new π bond is formed by overlap of the
C–H σ bond with the C–X σ* antibonding orbital. The two orbitals have to lie in the same
plane for best overlap, and now there are two conformations that allow this. One has H and
X syn-periplanar, the other anti-periplanar. The anti-periplanar conformation is more stable because it is staggered (the syn-periplanar conformation is eclipsed) but, more importantly, only in the anti-periplanar conformation are the bonds (and therefore the orbitals)
truly parallel.

E2 eliminations therefore take place preferentially from the anti-periplanar conformation.
We shall see shortly how we know this to be the case, but fi rst we consider an E2 elimination
that gives mainly one of two possible stereoisomers. 2-Bromobutane has two conformations
with H and Br anti-periplanar, but the one that is less hindered leads to more of the product,
and the E alkene predominates.

There is a choice of protons to be eliminated—the stereochemistry of the product results
from which proton is anti-periplanar to the leaving group when the reaction takes place, and
the reaction is stereoselective as a result.

###### E2 eliminations can be stereospecifi c

In the next example there is only one proton that can take part in the elimination. Now there
is no choice of anti-periplanar transition states. Whether the product is E or Z, the E2 reaction
has only one course to follow. And the outcome depends on which diastereoisomer of
the starting material is used. When the fi rst diastereoisomer is drawn with the proton and

have to lie one in front and one behind the plane of the paper. As the hydroxide attacks the
C–H bond and eliminates Br [−], this arrangement is preserved and the two phenyl groups end
up trans (the alkene is E). This is perhaps easier to see in the Newman projection of the same
conformation.

The second diastereoisomer forms the Z alkene for the same reasons: the two phenyl groups
are now on the same side of the H–C–C–Br plane in the reactive anti-periplanar conformation
(again, this is clear in the Newman projection) and so they end up cis in the product. Each
diastereoisomer gives a different alkene geometry, and they do so at different rates. The fi rst
reaction is about ten times as fast as the second because, although this anti-periplanar conformation is the only reactive one, it is not necessarily the most stable. The Newman projection
for the second reaction shows clearly that the two phenyl groups have to lie synclinal (gauche)
to one another: the steric interaction between these large groups will mean that, at any time, a
relatively small proportion of molecules will adopt the right conformation for elimination,
slowing the process down.
Reactions in which the stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the starting material are called stereospecifi c.



- A stereospecifi c reaction is
not simply a reaction that is very
stereoselective! The two terms
have different mechanistic
meanings, and are not just
different degrees of the same
thing.



- **Stereoselective or stereospecifi c?**

**•** **Stereoselective reactions give one predominant product because the reaction pathway has a choice.**
Either the pathway of lower activation energy is preferred (kinetic control) or the more stable product is
preferred (thermodynamic control).

**•** **Stereospecifi c reactions lead to the production of a single isomer as a direct result of the**
mechanism of the reaction and the stereochemistry of the starting material. There is no choice.
The reaction gives a different diastereoisomer of the product from each stereoisomer of the starting
material.


In the next chapter (p. 415)
you will see how the fact that pairs
of axial bonds have overlapping
orbitals also gives rise to
distinctively large [1]H NMR coupling
constants.


###### E2 eliminations from cyclohexanes

The stereospecifi city of the reactions you have just met is very good evidence that E2 reactions
proceed through an anti-periplanar transition state. We know with which diastereoisomer we
started, and we know which alkene we get, so there is no question over the course of the
reaction.
More evidence comes from the reactions of substituted cyclohexanes. You saw in Chapter
16 that substituents on cyclohexanes can be parallel with one another only if they are both
axial. An equatorial C–X bond is anti-periplanar only to C–C bonds and cannot take part in
an elimination. For mono-substituted cyclohexyl halides treated with base, this is not a problem because, although the axial conformer is less stable, there is still a signifi cant amount
present (see the table on p. 375), and elimination can take place from this conformer.

These two diastereoisomeric cyclohexyl chlorides derived from menthol react very differently under the same conditions with sodium ethoxide as base. Both eliminate HCl but diastereoisomer A reacts rapidly to give a mixture of products, while diastereoisomer B (which
differs only in the confi guration of the carbon atom bearing chlorine) gives a single alkene
product but very much more slowly. We can safely exclude E1 as a mechanism because the
same cation would be formed from both diastereoisomers, and this would mean the ratio of
products (although not necessarily the rate) would be the same for both.

The key to explaining reactions like this is to draw the conformation of the molecules. Both
will adopt a chair conformation, and generally the chair having the largest substituent equatorial (or the largest number of substituents equatorial) is the more stable. In these examples
the isopropyl group is most infl uential—it is branched and will have very severe 1,3-diaxial
interactions if it occupies an axial position. In both diastereoisomers, an equatorial i-Pr also
means an equatorial Me: the only difference is the orientation of the chlorine. For diastereoisomer A, the chlorine is forced axial in the major conformer: there is no choice because the
relative confi guration is fi xed in the starting material. It’s less stable than equatorial Cl, but is
ideal for E2 elimination and there are two protons that are anti-periplanar available for
removal by the base. The two alkenes are formed as a result of each of the possible protons
with a 3:1 preference for the more substituted alkene.
For diastereoisomer B, the chlorine is equatorial in the lowest-energy conformation. Once
again there is no choice. But equatorial leaving groups cannot be eliminated by E2: in this
conformation there is no anti-periplanar proton. This accounts for the difference in rate
between the two diastereoisomers. A has the chlorine axial virtually all the time ready for E2,
while B has an axial leaving group only in the minute proportion of the molecules that happen not to be in the lowest-energy conformation, but that have all three substituents axial.
The all-axial conformer is much higher in energy, but only in this confomer can Cl[−] be eliminated. The concentration of reactive molecules is low, so the rate is also low. There is only one

###### E2 elimination from vinyl halides: how to make alkynes

An anti-periplanar arrangement of C–Br and C–H is attainable with a vinylic bromide too,
provided the Br and H are trans to one another. E2 elimination from the Z isomer of a vinyl
bromide gives an alkyne rather faster than elimination from the E isomer because in the E
isomer the C–H and C–Br bonds are syn-periplanar.



- The base used here is LDA
(lithium diisopropylamide) made
by deprotonating i-Pr2NH with
BuLi (see p. 174). LDA is very
basic (pKa of i-Pr2NH is about
35) but too hindered to be
nucleophilic—ideal for
promoting E2 elimination.


Vinyl bromides can themselves be made by elimination reactions of 1,2-dibromoalkanes.
Watch what happens when 1,2-dibromopropane is treated with three equivalents of R2NLi:
fi rst, elimination to the vinyl halide, then elimination of the vinyl halide to the alkyne.
The terminal alkyne is amply acidic enough to be deprotonated by R2NLi, and this is the
role of the third equivalent. Overall, the reaction makes a lithiated alkyne (ready for further reactions) from a fully saturated starting material. This may well be the fi rst reaction
you have met that makes an alkyne from a starting material that doesn’t already contain a
triple bond.

###### The regioselectivity of E2 eliminations

Here are two deceptively similar elimination reactions. The leaving group changes and the
reaction conditions are very different but the overall process is elimination of HX to produce
one of two alkenes.

In the fi rst example acid-catalysed elimination of water from a tertiary alcohol produces a
trisubstitued alkene. Elimination of HCl from the corresponding tertiary alkyl chloride promoted by a very hindered alkoxide base (more hindered than t-BuOK because all the ethyl
groups have to point away from one another) gives exclusively the less stable disubstituted
alkene.
The reason for the two different regioselectivities is a change in mechanism. As we have
already discussed, acid-catalysed elimination of water from tertiary alcohols is usually E1, and
you already know the reason why the more substituted alkene forms faster in E1 reactions (p.
394). It should come as no surprise to you now that the second elimination, with a strong, hindered base, is an E2 reaction. But why does E2 give the less substituted product? This time, there
is no problem getting C–H bonds anti-periplanar to the leaving group: in the conformation


-----

with the Cl axial there are two equivalent ring hydrogens available for elimination, and removal
of either of these would lead to the trisubstituted alkene. Additionally, any of the three equivalent methyl hydrogens are in a position to undergo E2 elimination to form the disubstituted
alkene whether the Cl is axial or equatorial—and yet it is these and only these that are removed
by the hindered base. The diagram summarizes two of the possibilities.

The base attacks the methyl hydrogens because they are less hindered—they are attached to
a primary carbon atom, well away from the other axial hydrogens. E2 eliminations with hindered bases typically give the less substituted double bond because the fastest E2 reaction
involves deprotonation at the least-substituted site. The hydrogens attached to a less substituted carbon atom are also more acidic. Think of the conjugate bases: a t-butyl anion is more
basic (because the anion is destabilized by the three electron-donating alkyl groups) than a
methyl anion, so the corresponding alkane must be less acidic. Steric factors are evident in the
following E2 reactions, where changing the base from ethoxide to t-butoxide alters the major
product from the more to the less substituted alkene.

###### Hofmann and Saytsev

Traditionally, these two opposite preferences—for the more or the less substituted alkenes—have been called Saytsev’s
rule and Hofmann’s rule, respectively. You will see these names used (along with a number of alternative spellings—
acceptable for Saytsev, whose name is transliterated from Russian, but not for Hofmann: this Hofmann had one f and
two n’s), but there is little point remembering which is which (or how to spell them)—it is far more important to understand the reasons that favour formation of each of the two alkenes.


###### Anion-stabilizing groups allow another mechanism—E1cB

To fi nish this chapter, we consider a reaction that at fi rst sight seems to go against what we
have told you so far. It’s an elimination catalysed by a strong base (KOH), so it looks like E2.
But the leaving group is hydroxide, which we categorically (and truthfully) stated cannot be
a leaving group in E2 eliminations.

**O** **OH** **O**

**KOH**

The key to what is going on is the carbonyl group. In Chapter 8 you met the idea that negative charges are stabilized by conjugation with carbonyl groups, and the list on p. 176 demonstrated how acidic a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group is. The proton that is removed in this
elimination reaction is adjacent to the carbonyl group, and is therefore also rather acidic (pKa
about 20). This means that the base can remove it without the leaving group departing at the

called an enolate, and we will
discuss enolates in more detail

Although the anion is stabilized by the carbonyl group, it still prefers to lose a leaving group

This step is also the rate-determining step of the elimination—the elimination is unimolecular and so is some kind of E1 reaction. The leaving group is not lost from the starting
molecule, but from the conjugate base of the starting molecule, so this sort of elimination,
which starts with a deprotonation, is called E1cB (cB for conjugate base). Here is the full
mechanism, generalized for other carbonyl compounds.

It’s important to note that, while HO[−] is never a leaving group in E2 reactions, it can be a
leaving group in E1cB reactions. The anion it is lost from is already an alkoxide—the oxyanion does not need to be created as the HO[−] is lost. The establishment of conjugation in the
product also assists loss of HO[−]. As the scheme above implies, other leaving groups are possible
too. Here are two examples with methanesulfonate leaving groups.

You will have noticed that we have shown the deprotonation step in the last few mechanisms as an equilibrium. Both equilibria lie rather over to the left-hand side because neither
triethylamine (pKa of Et3NH[+] about 10) nor hydroxide (pKa of H2O 15.7) is basic enough to
remove completely a proton next to a carbonyl group (pKa - 20). However, because the loss
of the leaving group is essentially irreversible, only a small amount of deprotonated carbonyl compound is necessary to keep the reaction going. The important point about substrates that undergo E1cB is that there is some form of anion-stabilizing group next to the
proton to be removed—it doesn’t have to stabilize the anion very well but, as long as it
makes the proton more acidic, an E1cB mechanism has a chance. Here is an important
example with two phenyl rings helping to stabilize the anion, and a carbamate anion
(R2N—CO2−) as the leaving group.

The proton to be removed has a pKa of about 25 because its conjugate base is an aromatic

with a secondary or tertiary amine as the base. Spontaneous loss of CO2 from the eliminated
product gives an amine, and you will meet this class of compounds again in Chapter 23,
where we discuss the Fmoc protecting group.

###### The E1cB rate equation

The rate-determining elimination step in an E1cB reaction is unimolecular, so you might imagine it would have a fi rstorder rate equation. In fact, the rate is also dependent on the concentration of base. This is because the unimolecular
elimination involves a species—the anion—whose concentration is itself determined by the concentration of base by the
equilibrium we have just been discussing. Using the following general E1cB reaction, the concentration of the anion can
be expressed as shown.


-----

###### E1cB eliminations in context

We can also compare the E1cB mechanism with the other elimination reactions you have
met by thinking of the relative timing of proton removal and leaving group departure. E1
is at one end of the scale: the leaving group goes fi rst and proton removal follows in a second step. In E2 reactions, the two events happen at the same time: the proton is removed
as the leaving group leaves. In E1cB the proton removal moves in front of leaving group
departure.

We talked about regio- and stereoselectivity in connection with E1 and E2 reactions. With
E1cB, the regioselectivity is straightforward: the location of the double bond is defi ned by the
position of (a) the acidic proton and (b) the leaving group.

E1cB reactions may be stereoselective—the one above, for example, gives mainly the E alkene product (2:1 with Z). The intermediate anion is planar, so the stereochemistry of the starting materials is irrelevant, the less sterically hindered (usually E) product is preferred. This
double E1cB elimination, for example, gives only the E,E product.

To fi nish this chapter we need to tell you about two E1cB eliminations that you may meet in
unexpected places. We have saved them till now because they are unusual in that the leaving
group is actually part of the anion-stabilizing group itself. First of all, try spotting the E1cB

The reaction is deceptively simple—formation of an amide in the presence of base—and
you would expect the mechanism to follow what we told you in Chapter 10. But the acyl chloride is, in fact, set up for an E1cB elimination—and you should expect this whenever you see
an acyl chloride with acidic protons next to the carbonyl group used in the presence of a base such
as triethylamine.

The second ‘concealed’ E1cB elimination is disguised in the mechanism of formation of
methanesulfonates (mesylates). When we introduced sulfonate esters in Chapter 15, and
revisited them on p. 391 of this chapter, we avoided (uncharacteristically, you may say)
explaining the mechanism by which they are formed from sulfonyl chlorides. This was deliberate because, while TsCl reacts with alcohols by the mechanism you might predict, the reaction with MsCl involves an elimination step.
Here is the mechanism by which alkyl tosylates are formed from alcohols. The alcohol acts
as a nucleophile towards the electrophilic sulfonyl chloride, and pyridine removes a proton to
give the product.

Methanesulfonyl chloride by contrast has a feature it shares with the acyl chlorides just
above: a relatively acidic proton that can be removed by base. This deprotonation, followed by
loss of chloride, is the fi rst step in the formation of a mesylate ester. It is an E1cB elimination
and the product is called a sulfene.

The sulfene is electrophilic in a slightly odd way: the alcohol acts as a nucleophile for sulfur
and generates an anion of carbon which undergoes a proton transfer to give the mesylate. It is
not uncommon for anions to form adjacent to sulfur, as you will see again in Chapter 27. Notice
how similar the overall mechanism is to the acylation mechanism we showed you above.

-----

Some points about the table:

 - Methyl halides cannot eliminate as there are no appropriately placed protons.

 - Increasing branching favours elimination over substitution and strongly basic
hindered nucleophiles always eliminate unless there is no option.

 - Good nucleophiles undergo substitution by SN2 unless the substrate is tertiary
and then the intermediate cation can eliminate by E1 as well as substitute
by SN1.

 - High temperatures favour elimination by gearing up the importance of entropy in the
free energy of reaction (ΔG = ΔH – TΔS). This is a good way of ensuring E1 in
ambiguous cases.

###### Summary of the stabilities of types of alkene

Alkenes are stabilized by:

 - **conjugation—anything that can conjugate with an alkene stabilizes it, including**
carbonyl groups, nitriles, benzene rings, RO or RNH groups, or another alkene. This is
the strongest stabilization and usually dominates.

 - **substitution—alkyl groups stabilize alkenes weakly by σ-conjugation, so the more**
alkyl groups the better—but beware of the next point.

 - **lack of steric hindrance—as alkenes are planar, large, especially branched,**
substituents arranged syn on the alkene destabilize it, so tetra-substituted alkenes are
usually less stable than tri-substituted ones. If the alkene is in a stable ring, this does
not apply as the ring substituents have to be syn for the ring to exist.

###### Alkene stereochemistry: a summary of terminology

The offi cial way of assigning alkene geometry is E and Z. Z comes from the German zusammen
(together) and means that the two highest ranking substituents (by the same rules introduced
in Chapter 14 for R and S) are on the same side of the alkene. The letter Z is a particularly
unfortunate choice as it looks like a trans alkene! E comes from the German entgegen (opposed)
and means that the two highest ranking substituents are on opposite sides (and, if anything
also unfortunately looks like a cis alkene). The green numbers in the structures below show
the relative rankings of the two substituents at each end of the alkene and the consequent
assignment of geometry.

used only for alkenes and not
for three-dimensional
stereochemistry.

But possibly the most common method of referring to alkene geometry is to use cis and
_trans. These require a diagram as they refer to two substituents being on the same (cis) or_
opposite (trans) sides of the alkene. There is no specifi ed order of priority and the speaker
chooses substituents that are signifi cant to the structure or to the reaction under discussion,
making this a more fl exible and versatile way of talking about alkenes. We have assigned cis
and trans to the alkenes above to indicate their most important features, but notice the ambiguities that may occur.



- Much the same are the terms
syn and anti, introduced on
p. 317 and used for relative
three-dimensional
stereochemistry. There is no
formal defi nition, and a diagram
is needed for clarity.

                         - Some guidelines for solving unknown
structures

This is the fi rst of two review chapters on spectroscopic methods taken as a whole. In
Chapter 31 we shall tackle the complete identifi cation of organic compounds, including the
vital aspect of stereochemistry, introduced in Chapters 14 and 17. In this chapter we gather
together some of the ideas introduced in previous chapters on spectroscopy and mechanism,
and show how they are related. We shall explain the structure of the chapter as we go along.

###### There are three reasons for this chapter

**1.** To review the methods of structure determination we met in Chapters 3 and 13, to
extend them a little further, and to consider the relationships between them.

**2.** To show how these methods may be combined to determine the structure of
unknown molecules.

**3.** To provide useful tables of data for you to use when you are attempting to determine
unknown structures.

The main tables of data appear at the end of the chapter (pp. 423–425) so that they are easy
to refer to when you are working on problems. You may also wish to look at them, along with
the tables in the text, as you work through this chapter.
We shall deal with points 1 and 2 together, looking fi rst at the interplay between the
chemistry of the carbonyl group (as discussed in Chapters 10 and 11) and spectroscopy,
solving some structural problems, then moving on to discuss, for example, NMR of more

than one element in the same compound, doing some more problems, and so on. We hope
that the lessons from each section will help in your overall understanding of structure
solving. The fi rst section deals with the assignment of carbonyl compounds to their various classes.

###### Spectroscopy and carbonyl chemistry

Chapters 10 and 11 completed our systematic survey of carbonyl chemistry, and we can
now put together chemistry and spectroscopy on this most important of all functional
groups.
We have divided carbonyl compounds into two main groups:

**1.** **aldehydes (RCHO) and ketones (R[1]COR[2])**

**2.** **acids (RCO2H) and their derivatives (in order of reactivity):**

**acid chlorides (RCOCl)**

**anhydrides (RCO2COR)**

**esters (R[1]CO2R[2])**

**amides (RCONH2, R[1]CONMe2, etc.).**

Which spectroscopic methods most reliably distinguish these two groups? Which help us
to separate aldehydes from ketones? Which allow us to distinguish the various acid derivatives? Which offer the most reliable evidence on the chemistry of the carbonyl group? These
are the questions we tackle in this section.

###### Distinguishing aldehydes and ketones from acid derivatives

The most consistently reliable method for doing this is [13]C NMR. It doesn’t much matter
whether the compounds are cyclic or unsaturated or have aromatic substituents, they all give
carbonyl [13]C shifts in about the same regions. There is a selection of examples on the facing
page which we now discuss. First, look at the shifts arrowed into the carbonyl group on each
structure. All the aldehydes and ketones fall between 191 and 208 ppm regardless of structure,
whereas all the acid derivatives (and these are very varied indeed!) fall between 164 and
180 ppm. These two sets do not overlap and the distinction is easily made. Assigning the spectrum of the ketoacid in the margin, for example, is easy.

###### More on these structures

Aldehydes and ketones

The fi rst aldehyde is vanillin, which comes from the vanilla pod and gives the characteristic vanilla fl avour in, for example,
ice cream. Vanilla is the seed pod of a South American orchid. ‘Vanilla essence’ is made with synthetic vanillin and tastes
slightly different because the vanilla pod contains other fl avour components in small quantities. The second aldehyde is
retinal. As you look at this structure your eyes use the light reaching them to interconvert cis and trans retinal in your
retina to create nervous impulses (see also Chapter 27).
The two ketones are all fl avour compounds too. The fi rst, (–)-carvone, is the chief component (70%) of spearmint oil.
Carvone is an interesting compound: in Chapter 14 you met the mirror-image isomers known as enantiomers, and
(–)-carvone’s mirror image, (+)-carvone, is the chief component (35%) of dill oil. Our taste can tell the difference, although
an NMR machine can’t and both carvones have identical NMR spectra. See Chapter 14 for more detail! The second ketone
is ‘raspberry ketone’, which is largely responsible for the fl avour of raspberries. It is entirely responsible for the fl avour of
some ‘raspberry’ foods. The signal for the aromatic carbon joined to OH is at 154.3 ppm (in the 100–150 ppm region
because it is an unsaturated carbon atom joined to oxygen) and cannot possibly be confused with the ketone signal at
208.8 ppm. Both ketones have C=O shifts at about 200 ppm, and both lack any signals in the proton NMR of δ - 8.

Acid derivatives

Lipoic acid uses its S–S bond in redox reactions (Chapter 42), while shikimic acid is an intermediate in the formation of
compounds with benzene rings, such as phenylalanine, in living things (Chapter 42). Salicylic acid’s acetate ester is
aspirin, which is, of course, like the last example ibuprofen, a painkiller.
The fi rst acid chloride is a popular reagent for the synthesis of acetate esters and you have seen its reactions in Chapter
10. We have chosen three cyclic anhydrides as examples because they are all related to an important reaction (the
Diels–Alder reaction), which you will meet in Chapter 34.
The fi rst ester, methyl methacrylate, is a bulk chemical. It is the monomer whose polymerization gives Perspex, the rigid
transparent plastic used in windows and roofs. The second ester is an important local anaesthetic used for minor operations.
One amide is the now-familiar DMF, but the other is a tetrapeptide and so contains one carboxylic acid group at the end
and three amide groups. Although the four amino acids in this peptide are identical (alanine, Ala for short), the carbon NMR
faithfully picks up four different C=O signals, all made different by being different distances from the end of the chain.

- You need not, at this stage,
worry about how the reaction
works. It is more important that
you realize how spectroscopy
enables us to work out what has
happened even before we have
any idea how. Nonetheless, it is
true that the second structure
here also makes more sense
chemically as the carbon skeleton
is the same as in the starting
material.


The distinction can be vital in structural problems. The symmetrical alkyne diol below
cyclizes in acid with Hg(II) catalysis to a compound having, by proton NMR, the structural
fragments shown. The product is unsymmetrical in that the two CMe2 groups are still present,
but they are now different. In addition, the chemical shift of the CH2 group shows that it is
next to C=O but not next to oxygen. This leaves us with two possible structures. One is an ester
and one a ketone. The C=O shift is 218.8 ppm and so there is no doubt that the second structure is correct.

###### Distinguishing aldehydes from ketones is simple by proton NMR

Now look at the fi rst two groups, the aldehydes and ketones. The two aldehydes have smaller
carbonyl shifts than the two ketones, but they are too similar for this distinction to be reliable. What distinguishes the aldehydes very clearly is the characteristic proton signal for CHO
at 9–10 ppm. So you should identify aldehydes and ketones by C=O shifts in carbon NMR and
then separate the two by proton NMR.

###### Distinguishing acid derivatives by carbon NMR is diffi cult

Now examine the other panels on p. 409. The four carboxylic acids are all important biologically or medicinally. Their C=O shifts are very different from each other as well as from those
of the aldehydes or ketones.
The next fi ve compounds (two acid chlorides and three anhydrides) are all reactive acid
derivatives, and the fi ve esters and amides below them are all unreactive acid derivatives and
yet the C=O shifts of all ten compounds fall in the same range. The C=O chemical shift is
obviously not a good way to check on chemical reactivity.
What the carbon NMR fails to do is distinguish these types of acid derivative. There is more
variation between the carboxylic acids on display than between the different classes of acid
derivatives. This should be obvious if we show you some compounds containing two acid
derivatives. Would you care to assign these signals?

No, neither would we. In each case the difference between the carbonyl signals is only a few
ppm. Although acid chlorides are extremely reactive in comparison with esters or amides, the
electron defi ciency at the carbon nucleus as measured by deshielding in the NMR spectrum
evidently does not refl ect this. Carbon NMR reliably distinguishes acid derivatives as a group
from aldehydes and ketones as another group but it fails to distinguish even very reactive (for


-----

example, acid chlorides) from very unreactive (for example, amides) acid derivatives. So how
do we distinguish acid derivatives?

###### Acid derivatives are best distinguished by infrared


A much better measure is the difference in IR stretching frequency of the C=O group. We
discussed this in Chapter 10 (p. 206), where we noted a competition between conjugation by
lone-pair electron donation into the carbonyl from OCOR, OR, or NH2 and inductive withdrawal from the C=O group because of the electronegativity of the substituent. Conjugation
donates electrons into the π* orbital of the π bond and so lengthens and weakens it. The C=O
bond becomes more like a single bond and its stretching frequency moves towards the singlebond region, that is, it goes down. The inductive effect removes electrons from the π orbital
and so shortens and strengthens the π bond. It becomes more like a full double bond and
moves up in frequency.

These effects are balanced in different ways according to the substituent. Chlorine is poor
at lone-pair electron donation (its lone pair is in a large 3p orbital and overlaps badly with
the 2p orbital on carbon) but strongly electron-withdrawing so acid chlorides absorb at high
frequency, almost in the triple-bond region. Anhydrides have an oxygen atom between two
carbonyl groups. Inductive withdrawal is still strong but conjugation is weak because the
lone pairs are pulled both ways. Esters have a well-balanced combination with the inductive
effect slightly stronger (oxygen donates from a compatible 2p orbital but is very electronegative and so withdraws electrons strongly as well). Finally, amides are dominated by conjugation as nitrogen is a much stronger electron donor than oxygen because it is less
electronegative.

###### Conjugation with π electrons or lone pairs affects IR C=O stretches


We need to see how conjugation works when it is with a π bond rather than with a lone pair.
This will make the concept more general as it will apply to aldehydes and ketones as well as to
acid groups. How can we detect whether an unsaturated carbonyl compound is conjugated or
not? Well, compare these two unsaturated aldehydes.

of course, fl at. The others are not.
Even the four-membered ring is
slightly puckered, the fi ve and
especially the six-membered rings
more so. This is all discussed,
along with analysis of ring strain,
in Chapter 16.


The key differences are the frequency of the C=O stretch (lowered by 40 cm[−][1] by conjugation) and the strength (that is, the intensity) of the C=C stretch (increased by conjugation) in
the IR. In the [13]C NMR, C3 in the conjugated enal is moved out of the alkene region just into
the carbonyl region, showing how electron-defi cient this carbon atom must be. In the proton
NMR there are many effects but the downfi eld shift of the protons on the alkene, especially
C3 (again!), is probably the most helpful.

Because the infrared carbonyl frequencies follow such a predictable pattern, it is possible
to make a simple list of correlations using just three factors. Two are the ones we have been
discussing—conjugation (frequency-lowering) and the inductive effect (frequency-raising). The third is the effect of small rings and this we next need to consider in a broader
context.

###### Small rings introduce strain inside the ring and higher s character outside it

Cyclic ketones can achieve the perfect 120° angle at the carbonyl group only if the ring is at
least six-membered. The smaller rings are ‘strained’ because the orbitals have to overlap at a
less than ideal angle.
For a four-membered ring, the actual angle is 90°, so there is 120° – 90° = 30° of strain at
the carbonyl group. The effects of this strain on fi ve-, four-, and three-membered rings are
shown here.

But why should strain raise the frequency of a carbonyl group? It is evidently
shortening and strengthening the C=O bond as it moves it towards the triple

bond region (higher frequency), not towards the single-bond region (lower **RHN**
frequency). In a six-membered ring, the sp[2] orbitals forming the σ framework

**N**

around the carbonyl group can overlap perfectly with the sp[3] orbitals on

**O**

neighbouring carbon atoms because the orbital angle and the bond angle are
the same. In a four-membered ring the orbitals do not point towards those on β-lactam in penicillin
the neighbouring carbon atoms, but point too far out, effectively forcing the 1715 cm
bonds to be bent and lowering the degree of overlap.
Ideally, we should like the orbitals to have an angle of 90° as this would make the orbital
angle the same as the bond angle. In theory it would be possible to have a bond angle of 90°
if we used pure p orbitals instead of sp[2] hybrid orbitals. The diagram in the margin shows this
hypothetical situation. If we did this, we should leave a pure s orbital for the σ bond to oxygen. This extreme is not possible, but a compromise is. Some more p character goes into the
ring bonds—maybe they become s[0.8]p[3.2]—so that they can approach the 90° angle needed,
and the same amount of extra s character goes into the σ bond to oxygen. The more s character there is in the orbital, the shorter it gets as s orbitals are much smaller than p orbitals.

###### Simple calculations of C=O stretching frequencies in IR spectra

The best way is to relate all our carbonyl frequencies to those for saturated ketones (1715 cm[−][1]).
We can summarize what we have just learned in a table.
Notice in this simple table (for full details you should refer as usual to a specialist book) that
the adjustment ‘30 cm[−][1]’ appears quite a lot (–30 cm[−][1] for both alkene and aryl, for example),
that the increment for small rings is 35 cm[−][1] each time (30 to 65 cm[−][1] and then 65 to 100 cm[−][1]),
and that the extreme effects of Cl and NH2 are +85 and –85 cm[−][1], respectively. These effects
are additive. If you want to estimate the C=O frequency of a proposed structure, just add or
subtract all the adjustments to 1715 cm[−][1] and you will get a reasonable result.

Try this out with the fi ve-membered unsaturated (and conjugated) lactone (cyclic ester) in
the margin. We must add 30 cm[−][1] for the ester, subtract 30 cm[−][1] for the double bond, and add
30 cm[−][1] for the fi ve-membered ring. Two of those cancel out, leaving just 1715 + 30 = 1745 cm[−][1].
These compounds absorb at 1740–1760 cm[−][1]. Not bad!

###### NMR spectra of alkynes and small rings

This idea that small rings have more p character in the ring and more s character outside
the ring also explains the effects of small rings on proton NMR shifts. These hydrogens,
particularly on three-membered rings, resonate at unusually high fi elds, between 0 and 1 ppm
in cyclopropanes instead of the 1.3 ppm expected for CH2 groups, and may even appear at
negative δ values. High p character in the framework of small rings also means high s character in C–H bonds outside the ring and this will mean shorter bonds, greater shielding, and
small δ values.

You have also seen the same argument used in Chapter 8 to justify the unusual Here is an example where deprotonation occurs at a different site in two comacidity of C–H protons on triple bonds (such as alkynes and HCN), and alluded pounds identical except for a C–C bond closing a three-membered ring.

Now what about the NMR spectra of alkynes? By the same argument, protons on alkynes
ought to appear in the NMR at quite high fi eld because the C atom is sp hybridized, so it makes
its σ bonds with sp orbitals (i.e. 50% s character). Protons on a typical alkene have δH about
5.5 ppm, while the proton on an alkyne comes right in the middle of the protons on saturated
carbons at about δH 2–2.5 ppm This is rather a large effect just for increased s character and
some of it is probably due to better shielding by the triple bond, which surrounds the linear
alkyne with π bonds without a nodal plane.
This means that the carbon atoms also appear at higher fi eld than expected, not in the alkene region but from about δC 60–80 ppm. The s character argument is important, however,
because shielding can’t affect IR stretching frequencies, yet C≡C–H stretches are strong and
at about 3300 cm[−][1], just right for a strong C–H bond.
A simple example is the ether 3-methoxyprop-1-yne. Integration alone allows us to assign
the spectrum and the 1H signal at 2.42 ppm, the highest fi eld signal, is clearly the alkyne
proton. Notice also that it is a triplet and that the OCH2 group is a doublet. This [4]JHH is small
(about 2 Hz) and, although there is nothing like a letter ‘W’ in the arrangement of the bonds,
coupling of this kind is often found in alkynes.

You may have noticed that we have drawn the double bond with the cis (Z) confi guration.
We know that this is true because of the proton NMR, which shows a 6.5 Hz coupling between
the two alkene protons (much too small for a trans coupling; see p. 295). There is also the
longer-range coupling ([4]J = 2.5 Hz) just described and even a small very long-range coupling
([5]J = 1 Hz) between the alkyne proton and the terminal alkene proton.

###### Proton NMR distinguishes axial and equatorial protons in cyclohexanes

Coupling is a through-bond phenomenon, as we know from the couplings in cis and trans
alkenes, where trans alkenes have much larger coupling constants as their orbitals are perfectly parallel. Another case of perfectly parallel orbitals occurs with trans-diaxial protons in
cyclohexanes. Typical coupling constants are 10–12 Hz for trans-diaxial protons, but much
smaller (2–5 Hz) for axial/equatorial and equatorial/equatorial protons.

This makes assignment of conformation easy. The simple ester below has a triple triplet for
the black H, with two large coupling constants (8.8 Hz) that must be to axial protons (green)
and two small coupling constants (3.8 Hz) that must be to equatorial Hs (brown). This is possible only if the black H is axial and the ester group must therefore be equatorial. The acetal
ester on the right is very different: it is a simple triplet with two small coupling constants
(3.2 Hz), which is too small for an axial/axial coupling. The only possibility therefore is that the
black proton is equatorial, and one of the 3.2 Hz couplings is to its equato rial neighbour, and
the other to its axial neighbour. The ester group must be axial in this compound.

###### Interactions between different nuclei can give enormous coupling constants

We have looked at coupling between hydrogen atoms and you may have wondered why we have
ignored coupling between other NMR active nuclei. Why does [13]C not cause similar couplings?
In this section we are going to consider not only couplings between the same kind of nuclei,


-----

- Note that these spectra with
heteronuclear couplings provide
the only cases where we can see
one doublet in the proton NMR.
Normally, if there is one
doublet, there must be another
signal with at least this
complexity as all coupling
appears twice (A couples to B
and so B also couples to A!). If
the coupling is to another
element (here phosphorus) then
the coupling appears once in
each spectrum. The Wittig
reagent has an A3P (CH3–P)
system: proton A appears as a
doublet, while the phosphorus
atom appears as a quartet in
the phosphorus spectrum at a
completely different frequency,
but with the same coupling
constant measured in Hz.


such as two protons, called homonuclear coupling, but also coupling between different nuclei,
such as a proton and a fl uorine atom or [13]C and [31]P, called heteronuclear coupling.
Two nuclei are particularly important, [19]F and [31]P, since many organic compounds contain
these elements and both are at essentially 100% natural abundance and have spin I = 1/2.
We shall start with organic compounds that have just one of these nuclei and see what happens to both the [1]H and the [13]C spectra. In fact, it is easy to fi nd a [19]F or a [31]P atom in a
molecule because these elements couple to all nearby carbon and hydrogen atoms. Since
they can be directly bonded to either, [1]J coupling constants such as [1]JCF or [1]JPH become possible, as well as the more ‘normal’ couplings such as [2]JCF or [3]JPH, and these [1]J coupling constants can be enormous.
We shall start with a simple phosphorus compound, the dimethyl ester of phosphorous acid
(H3PO3). There is an uncertainty about the structure of both the acid and its esters. They could
exist as P(III) compounds with a lone pair of electrons on phosphorus, or as P(V) compounds
with a P=O double bond.

In fact, dimethyl phosphite has a 1H doublet with the amazing coupling constant of
693 Hz: on a 250 MHz machine the two lines are over 2 ppm apart and it is easy to miss that
they are two halves of the same doublet. This can only be a [1]JPH as it is so enormous. The
compound has to have a P–H bond and the P(V) structure is correct. The coupling to the
protons of the methyl group is much smaller but still large for a three-bond coupling ([3]JPC of
18 Hz).
Next, consider the phosphonium salt you met at the end of Chapter 11 for use in the Wittig
reaction, turning aldehydes and ketones to alkenes. It has a [2]JPH of 18 Hz. There is no doubt
about this structure—it is just an illustration of coupling to phosphorus. There is coupling to
phosphorus in the carbon spectrum too: the methyl group appears at δC 10.6 ppm with a [1]JPC
of 57 Hz, somewhat smaller than typical [1]JPH. We haven’t yet talked about couplings to [13]C: we
shall now do so.

###### Coupling in carbon NMR spectra

We shall use coupling with fl uorine to introduce this section. Fluorobenzenes are good examples because they have a number of different carbon atoms all coupled to the fl uorine atom.

The carbon directly joined to fl uorine (the ipso carbon) has a very large [1]JCF value of about
250 Hz. More distant coupling is evident too: all the carbons in the ring couple to the fl uorine
in PhF with steadily diminishing J values as the carbons become more distant.
Trifl uoroacetic acid is an important strong organic acid (Chapter 8) and a good solvent for

1H NMR. The carbon atom of the CF3 group is coupled equally to all the three fl uorines and so
appears as a quartet with a large [1]JCF of 283 Hz, about the same as in PhF. Even the carbonyl

group is also a quartet, although the coupling constant is much smaller ([2]JCF is 43 Hz). Notice
too how far downfi eld the CF3 carbon atom is!

###### Coupling between protons and [13]C


100 50 0 ppm


In view of all this, you may ask why we don’t apparently see couplings between [13]C and [1]H in
either carbon or proton spectra. In proton spectra the answer is simple: we don’t see coupling
to [13]C because of the low abundance (1.1%) of [13]C. Most protons are bonded to [12]C: only 1.1%
of protons are bonded to [13]C. If you look closely at proton spectra with very fl at baselines, you
may see small peaks either side of strong peaks at about 0.5% peak height. These are the [13]C
‘satellites’ for those protons that are bonded to [13]C atoms.
As an example, look again at the 500 MHz [1]H NMR spectrum of heptan-2-one that we saw on
p. 294. When the baseline of this spectrum is vertically expanded, the [13]C satellites may be seen.
The singlet due to the methyl protons is actually in the centre of a tiny doublet due to the 1% of
protons coupling to [13]C. Similarly, each of the triplets in the spectrum is fl anked by two tiny
triplets. The two tiny triplets on either side make up a doublet of triplets with a large [1]J coupling
constant to the [13]C (around 130 Hz) and smaller [3]J coupling to the two equivalent protons.

13C satellites are usually lost in the background noise of the spectrum and need concern us
no further. You do, however, see coupling in the [1]H NMR spectrum with compounds deliberately labelled with [13]C because the [13]C abundance can then approach 100%. The same Wittig
reagent we saw a moment ago shows a 3H doublet of doublets with the typically enormous [1]JCH
of 135 Hz when labelled with pure [13]C in the methyl group.

-----

But this begs the question—where is the 135 Hz coupling in the [13]C NMR? Surely we should
see this coupling to the protons in the [13]C NMR spectrum too?

###### Why is there no coupling to protons in normal [13]C NMR spectra?

We get the singlets consistently seen in carbon spectra because of the way we record the spectra. The values of [1]JCH are so large that, if we recorded [13]C spectra with all the coupling constants, we would get a mass of overlapping peaks. When run on the same spectrometer, the
frequency at which [13]C nuclei resonate turns out to be about a quarter of that of the protons.
Thus a ‘400 MHz machine’ (remember that the magnet strength is usually described by the
frequency at which the protons resonate) gives [13]C spectra at 100 MHz. Coupling constants
([1]JCH) of 100–250 Hz would cover 2–5 ppm and a CH3 group with [1]JCH of about 125 Hz would
give a quartet covering nearly 8 ppm (see the example on the previous page).

Since the proton-coupled [13]C spectrum can so easily help us to distinguish CH3, CH2, CH,
and quaternary carbons, you might wonder why they are not used more. The above example
was chosen very carefully to illustrate proton-coupled spectra at their best. Unfortunately, this
is not a typical example. More usually, the confusion from overlapping peaks makes this just
not worthwhile. So [13]C NMR spectra are recorded while the whole 10 ppm proton spectrum is
being irradiated with a secondary radio frequency source. The proton energy levels are equalized by this process and all coupling disappears. Hence the singlets we are used to seeing.
For the rest of this chapter we shall not be introducing new theory or new concepts; we shall
be applying what we have told you to a series of examples where spectroscopy enables chemists to identify compounds.

###### Identifying products spectroscopically

 An ambiguous reaction product

In Chapter 3 we gave an example of a compound which was misidentifi ed because an O
atom and an N atom were mistaken for one another, even in the X-ray crystal structure.


-----

Another famous case of ambiguity between structures containing O or N arises in the identifi cation of the product of addition of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) to a simple enone. This
condensation reaction gives a compound with the formula C6H11NO. But what is its structure? We can fi rst of all think about what we expect to happen: it is not always necessary to
do this in order to identify a structure, but it can help. Nitrogen is more nucleophilic than
oxygen so we might expect it to add fi rst. But will it add directly to the carbonyl group or in
the conjugate fashion we shall describe in Chapter 22? Either way, an intermediate will be
formed that can cyclize.

The two possible isomeric products were once the subject of a long-running controversy, but
with IR and proton NMR spectra of the product, doubt vanished. The IR showed no NH
stretch. The NMR showed no alkene proton but did have a CH2 group at 2.63 ppm. Only the
second structure is possible.
We need to look now at a selection of problems of different kinds to show how the various
spectroscopic methods can cooperate in structure determination.

###### Reactive intermediates can be detected by spectroscopy

Some intermediates proposed in reaction mechanisms look so unlikely that it is comforting if
they can be isolated and their structure determined. We feel more confi dent in proposing an
intermediate if we are sure that it can really be made. Of course, this is not necessarily evidence that the intermediate is actually formed during reactions and it certainly does not follow that the failure to isolate a given intermediate disproves its involvement in a reaction. We
shall use ketene as an example.
Ketene looks pretty unlikely! It is CH2=C=O with two π bonds (C=C and C=O) to the same
carbon atom. The orbitals for these π bonds must be orthogonal because the central carbon
atom is sp hybridized with two linear σ bonds and two p orbitals at right angles both to the
σ bonds and to each other. Can such a molecule exist? When acetone vapour is heated to very
high temperatures (700–750 °C) methane is given off and ketene is supposed to be the other
product. What is isolated is a ketene dimer (C4H4O2) and even the structure of this is in doubt
as two reasonable structures can be written.



- Do not be concerned about
the details of the mechanisms:
note that we have used the
‘± H[+]’ shorthand introduced in
Chapter 11, and have
abbreviated the mechanism
where water is eliminated and
the oxime formed—the full
mechanism of imine (and oxime)
formation can be found in
Chapter 11, p. 229. In this
chapter, we are much more
concerned just with the structure
of the products.



- We used this logic in
Chapter 15: carbocations were
proposed as intermediates in
SN1 reactions long before they
were observed spectroscopically,
but it was reassuring to be able
to see them by NMR once
appropriate conditions were
devised (see p. 335).

The spectra fi t the ester structure well, but not the more symmetrical diketone structure at
all. There are three types of proton (cyclobuta-1,3-dione would have just one), with allylic coupling between one of the protons on the double bond and the CH2 group in the ring. The
carbonyl group has the shift (185 ppm) of an acid derivative (not that of a ketone, which
would be about 200 ppm) and all four carbons are different.

Ozonolysis of ketene dimer gives a very unstable compound that can be observed only at
low temperatures (–78 °C or below). It has two carbonyl bands in the IR and reacts with amines
to give amides, so it looks like an anhydride (Chapter 10). Can it be the previously unknown
cyclic anhydride of malonic acid?
The two carbonyl bands are of high frequency, as would be expected for a four-membered
ring—using the table on p. 413 we estimate 1715 + 50 cm[−][1] (for the anhydride) + 65 cm[−][1] (for
the four-membered ring) = 1830 cm[−][1]. Both the proton and the carbon NMR are very simple:
just a 2H singlet at 4.12 ppm, shifted downfi eld by two carbonyls, a C=O group at 160 ppm,
right for an acid derivative, and a saturated carbon shifted downfi eld but not as much as a
CH2O group.

All this is reasonably convincing, and is confi rmed by allowing the anhydride to warm to
–30 °C, at which temperature it loses CO2 (detected by the [13]C peak at 124.5 ppm) and gives
another unstable compound with the strange IR frequency of 2140 cm[−][1]. Could this be monomeric ketene? It’s certainly not either of the possible ketene dimers as we know what their
spectra are like, and this is quite different: just a 2H singlet at 2.24 ppm and [13]C peaks at 194.0
and, remarkably, 2.5 ppm. It is indeed monomeric ketene.

###### Squares and cubes: molecules with unusual structures

Some structures are interesting because we believe they can tell us something fundamental
about the nature of bonding while others are a challenge because many people argue that
they cannot be made. What do you think are the prospects of making cyclobutadiene, a
conjugated four-membered ring, or the hydrocarbons tetrahedrane and cubane, which
have, respectively, the shapes of the perfectly symmetrical Euclidean solids, the tetrahedron
and the cube?
With four electrons, cyclobutadiene is anti-aromatic—it has 4n instead of 4n + 2 electrons.
You saw in Chapter 7 that cyclic conjugated systems with 4n electrons (cyclooctatetraene, for
example) avoid being conjugated by puckering into a tub shape. Cyclobutadiene cannot do
this: it must be more or less planar, and so we expect it to be very unstable. Tetrahedrane has
four fused three-membered rings. Although the molecule is tetrahedral in shape, each carbon
atom is nowhere near a tetrahedron, with three bond angles of 60°. Cubane has six fused fourmembered rings and is again highly strained.
In fact, cubane has been made, cyclobutadiene has a fl eeting existence but can be isolated
as an iron complex, and a few substituted versions of tetrahedrane have been made. The most
convincing evidence that you have made any of these three compounds would be the extreme
simplicity of the spectra. Each has only one kind of hydrogen and only one kind of carbon.
They all belong to the family (CH)n.
Cubane has a molecular ion in the mass spectrum at 104, correct for C8H8, only CH stretches
in the IR at 3000 cm[−][1], a singlet in the proton NMR at 4.0 ppm, and a single line in the carbon


-----

NMR at 47.3 ppm. It is a very symmetrical molecule and a stable one in spite of all those fourmembered rings.
Stable compounds with a cyclobutadiene and a tetrahedrane core can be made if each hydrogen atom is replaced by a t-butyl group. The very large groups round the edge of the molecule
repel each other and hold the inner core tightly together. Now another diffi culty arises—it is
rather hard to tell the compounds apart. They both have four identical carbon atoms in the
core and four identical t-butyl groups round the edge. The starting material for a successful
synthesis of both was the tricyclic ketone below identifi ed by its strained C=O stretch and
partly symmetrical NMR spectra. When this ketone was irradiated with UV light (indicated by
‘hν’ in the scheme), carbon monoxide was evolved and a highly symmetrical compound
(t-BuC)4 was formed. But which compound was it?

tetrahedrane cyclobutadiene

The story is made more complicated (but in the end easier!) by the discovery that this compound on heating turned into another very similar compound. There are only two possible
structures for (t-BuC)4, so clearly one compound must be the tetrahedrane and one the cyclobutadiene. The problem simplifi es with this discovery because it is easier to distinguish two
possibilities when you can make comparisons between two sets of spectra. Here both compounds gave a molecular ion in the mass spectrum, neither had any interesting absorptions in
the IR, and the proton NMRs could belong to either compound as they simply showed four
identical t-Bu groups. So did the carbon NMR, of course, but it showed the core too. The fi rst
product had only saturated carbon atoms, while the second had a signal at 152.7 ppm for the
unsaturated carbons. The tetrahedrane is formed from the tricyclic ketone on irradiation but it
isomerizes to the cyclobutadiene on heating.

###### Identifying compounds from nature

The next molecules we need to know how to identify are those discovered from nature—
natural products. These often have biological activity and many useful medicines have been
discovered this way. We shall look at a few examples from different fi elds. The fi rst is the sex
pheromone of the Trinidad butterfl y Lycorea ceres ceres. The male butterfl ies start courtship by
emitting a tiny quantity of a volatile compound. Identifi cation of this type of compound is
very diffi cult because of the minute amounts available but this compound was crystallized
and gave enough for a mass spectrum and an IR. The highest peak in the mass spectrum was
at 135. This is an odd number so we might have one nitrogen atom and a possible composition
of C8H9ON. The IR showed a carbonyl peak at 1680 cm[−][1]. With only this meagre information,
the fi rst proposals were for a pyridine aldehyde.
Eventually a little more compound (6 mg!) was available and a proton NMR spectrum was
run. This showed at once that this structure was wrong. There was no aldehyde proton and
only one methyl group. More positive information was the pair of triplets showing a –CH2CH2–
unit between two electron-withdrawing groups (N and C=O?) and the pair of doublets for
neighbouring protons on an aromatic ring, although the chemical shift and the coupling
constant are both rather small for a benzene ring.
If we look at what we have got so far, we see that we have accounted for four carbon atoms
in the methyl and carbonyl groups and the –CH2CH2– unit. This leaves only four carbon
atoms for the aromatic ring. We must use nitrogen too as the only possibility is a pyrrole
ring. Our fragments are now those shown below (the black dotted lines show joins to
another fragment). These account for all the atoms in the molecule and suggest structures
such as these.

Now we need to use the known chemical shifts and coupling constants for these sorts of
molecules. An N–Me group would normally have a larger chemical shift than 2.2 ppm so we
prefer the methyl group on a carbon atom of the pyrrole ring. Typical shifts and coupling
constants around pyrroles are shown below. Chemists do not, of course, remember these
numbers; we look them up in tables. Our data, with chemical shifts of 6.09 and 6.69 ppm and
a coupling constant of 2.5 Hz, clearly favour hydrogen atoms in the 2 and 3 positions, and
suggest this structure for the sex pheromone, which was confi rmed by synthesis and is now
accepted as correct.

The fi nal section of this chapter contains some tables of NMR data, which we hope you will
fi nd useful in solving problems. In Chapter 13 there were a few guides to chemical shift—
summaries of patterns that you might reasonably be expected to remember. But we have left
the main selections of hard numbers—tables that you are not expected to remember—until now.
There are a few comments to explain the tables, but you will probably want to use this section
as reference rather than bedtime reading. The fi rst four tables give detailed values for various
kinds of compounds and the fi nal table gives a simple summary. We hope that you will fi nd
this last table particularly useful.

###### Effects of electronegativity

This table shows how the electronegativity of the atom attached directly to a methyl group
affects the shifts of the CH3 protons (δH) and the CH3 carbon atom (δC) in their NMR spectra.

###### Effects of functional groups

Many substituents are more complicated than just a single atom and electronegativity is only
part of the story. We need to look at all the common substituents and see what shifts they cause
relative to the CH skeleton of the molecule. Our zero really ought to be at about 0.9 ppm for
protons and at 8.4 ppm for carbon, that is, where ethane (CH3–CH3) resonates, and not at the
arbitrary zero allocated to Me4Si. In the table below we give such a list. The reason for this is
that the shifts (from Me4Si) themselves are not additive but the shift differences (from 0.9 or
8.4 ppm) are.

The effects of groups based on carbon (the methyl group is joined directly to another carbon
atom) appear in entries 2 to 11. All the electron-withdrawing groups based on carbonyl and
cyanide have about the same effect (1.1–1.3 ppm downfi eld shift from 0.9 ppm). Groups based
on nitrogen (Me–N bond) show a similar progression through amine, ammonium salt, amide,
and nitro compound (entries 15–18). Finally, all the oxygen-based groups (Me–O bond) show
large shifts (entries 19–22).

###### Effects of substituents on CH2 groups

It is more diffi cult to give a defi nitive list for CH2 groups as they have two substituents. In
the table below we set one substituent as phenyl (Ph) just because so many compounds of
this kind are available, and give the actual shifts relative to PhCH2CH3 for protons
(2.64 ppm) and PhCH2CH3 for carbon (28.9 ppm), again comparing the substituent with
the CH skeleton.
If you compare the shifts caused on a CH2 group by each functional group in the table
below with the shifts caused on a CH3 group by the same functional group in the table on
p. 423 you will see that they are broadly the same.

###### Shifts of a CH group

We can do the same with a CH group, and in the left-hand side of the table below we take a
series of isopropyl compounds, comparing the measured shifts with those for the central
proton (CHMe2) or carbon (CHMe2) of 2-methylpropane. We set two of the substituents
as methyl groups and just vary the third. Yet again the shifts for the same substituent are
broadly the same.

###### Shifts in proton NMR are easier to calculate and more informative than those in carbon NMR

This fi nal table, on p. 426, helps to explain something we have avoided so far. Correlations of
shifts caused by substituents in proton NMR really work very well. Those in [13]C NMR work
much less well and more complicated equations are needed. More strikingly, the proton shifts
often seem to fi t better with our understanding of the chemistry of the compounds. There are
two main reasons for this.
First, the carbon atom is much closer to the substituent than the proton. In the compounds
in the table on p. 423 the methyl carbon atom is directly bonded to the substituent, while the
protons are separated from it by the carbon atom of the methyl group. If the functional group
is based on a large electron-withdrawing atom like sulfur, the protons will experience a simple
inductive electron withdrawal and have a proportional downfi eld shift. The carbon atom is
close enough to the sulfur atom to be shielded as well by the lone-pair electrons in the large
3sp[3] orbitals. The proton shift caused by S in Me2S is about the same (1.23 ppm) as that caused
by a set of more or less equally strong electron-withdrawing groups like CN (1.14 ppm) or ester
(1.18 ppm). The carbon shift (9.7 ppm) is less than that caused by an ester (11.2 ppm) but
much more than that caused by CN, which actually shifts the carbon upfi eld (–6.6 ppm) relative to the effect of a methyl group.

###### Check your understanding


Second, the carbon shift is strongly affected not only by
what is directly joined to that atom (α position), but also by
what comes next (β position). The right-hand half of the
table on p. 424 shows what happens to methyl shifts when
substituents are placed on the next carbon atom. There is
very little effect on the proton spectrum: all the values are
much less than the shifts caused by the same substituent on
a methyl group in the table on p. 423. Carbonyls give a downfi eld shift of about 1.2 ppm when directly joined to a methyl
group, but only of about 0.2 ppm when one atom further
away. By contrast, the shifts in the carbon spectrum are of the
same order of magnitude in the two tables, and the β shift
may even be greater than the α shift! The CN group shifts a
directly bonded methyl group upfi eld (–6.6 ppm) when
directly bonded, but downfi eld (14.4 ppm) when one atom
further away. This is an exaggerated example, but the point is
that these carbon shifts must not be used to suggest that the
CN group is electron-donating in the α position and electronwithdrawing in the β position. The carbon shifts are erratic
but the proton shifts give us useful information and are worth
understanding as a guide to both structure determination
and the chemistry of the compound.
When you use this table and are trying to interpret, say, a
methyl group at 4.0 ppm then you have no problem. Only
one group is attached to a methyl group so you need a single
shift value—it might be a methyl ester, for example. But
when you have a CH2 group at 4.5 ppm and you are interpreting a downfi eld shift of 3.2 ppm you must beware. There
are two groups attached to each CH2 group and you might
need a single shift of about 3 ppm (say, an ester again) or two
shifts of 1.5 ppm, and so on. The shifts are additive.

###### Alkenes react with bromine


Bromine (Br2) is brown, and one of the classic tests for alkenes is that they turn a brown aqueous solution of bromine colourless. Alkenes decolourize bromine water: alkenes react with
bromine. The product of the reaction is a dibromoalkane, and the reaction on the right shows
what happens with the simplest alkene, ethylene (ethene).
In order to understand this reaction, and the other similar ones you will meet in this chapter, you need to think back to Chapter 5, where we started talking about reactivity in terms of
nucleophiles and electrophiles. As soon as you see a new reaction, you should immediately
think to yourself, ‘Which reagent is the nucleophile; which reagent is the electrophile?’
Evidently, neither the alkene nor bromine is charged, but Br2 has a low-energy empty orbital
(the Br–Br σ*), and is therefore an electrophile. The Br–Br bond is exceptionally weak, and
bromine reacts with many nucleophiles like this.

**Nu** **Br** **Br** **Nu** **Br** + **Br**

In the reaction with ethylene, the alkene must be the nucleophile, and its HOMO is the
C=C π bond. Other simple alkenes are similarly electron-rich and they typically act as nucleo_philes and attack electrophiles._

When it reacts with Br2, the alkene’s fi lled π orbital (the HOMO) will interact with the bromine’s empty σ* orbital to give a product. But what will that product be? Look at the orbitals
involved.

The highest electron density in the π orbital is right in the middle, between the two carbon atoms, so this is where we expect the bromine to attack. The only way the π HOMO can
interact in a bonding manner with the σ* LUMO is if the Br2 approaches end-on—and this
is how the product forms. The symmetrical three-membered ring product is called a bromonium ion.

Compare the second step with
the way nucleophiles attack
epoxides, Chapter 15, p. 354.


How shall we draw curly arrows for the formation of the bromonium ion? We have a choice.
The simplest way is just to show the middle of the π bond attacking Br–Br, mirroring what we
know happens with the orbitals.

**Br** **Br** **Br** **Br**

But there is a problem with this representation: because only one pair of electrons is moving,
we can’t form two new C–Br bonds. We should really then represent the C–Br bonds as partial
bonds. Yet the bromonium ion is a real intermediate with two proper C–Br bonds (the box in
the margin presents evidence of this). So an alternative way of drawing the arrows is to involve
a lone pair on bromine.

**Br** **Br** **Br** **Br**

We think the fi rst way represents more accurately the key orbital interaction involved, and
we shall use that one, but the second is acceptable too.
Of course, the fi nal product of the reaction isn’t the bromonium ion. The second step of the
reaction follows on at once: the bromonium ion is itself an electrophile, and it reacts with the
bromide ion lost from the bromine in the addition step. We can now draw the correct mechanism for the whole reaction, which is termed electrophilic addition to the double bond,
because bromine (Br2) is an electrophile. Overall, the molecule of bromine adds across the
double bond of the alkene.

-----

Attack of Br on a bromonium ion is a normal SN2 substitution—the key orbitals involved are
the HOMO of the bromide and the σ* of one of the two carbon–bromine bonds in the strained
three-membered ring. As with all SN2 reactions, the nucleophile maintains maximal overlap
with the σ* by approaching in line with the leaving group but from the opposite side, resulting in inversion at the carbon that is attacked. The stereochemical outcome of more complicated reactions (discussed below) is important evidence for this overall reaction mechanism.
You may wonder why the bromine attacks a carbon atom in the bromonium ion rather than
the positively charged bromine atom. Well, in fact, it can do this as well, but the result is just
regeneration of bromine and the alkene: the fi rst step of the reaction is reversible.

###### Another way of thinking about bromonium ions

You can think of the bromonium ion as a carbocation that has been stabilized by interaction with a nearby bromine atom.
You have seen a similar effect with oxygen—this ‘oxonium ion’ was an intermediate, for example, in the SN1 substitution
of MOM chloride on p. 338 of Chapter 15.
The bromine is one atom further away but, with bromine being lower in the periodic table and having more diffuse lone
pairs, it can have a similar stabilizing effect, despite the angle strain in a three-membered ring.
The two types of stabilization are not equivalent: the cation and the bromonium ion are different molecules with different
shapes, while the two representations of the oxonium ion are just that—they aren’t different molecules. This stabilization
of an adjacent cationic centre by a heteroatom with at least one lone pair to form a three-membered ring intermediate is
not restricted to bromine or the other halogens, but is also an important aspect of the chemistry of compounds containing
oxygen, sulfur, or selenium, as you will see in Chapter 27.

###### Oxidation of alkenes to form epoxides

The electrophilic addition of bromine to alkenes is an oxidation. The starting alkene is equivalent in oxidation level to an alcohol, but the product has two carbons at the alcohol oxidation
level—the elimination reactions of dibromides to give alkynes that you met in Chapter 17
(p. 398) should convince you of this. There are a number of other oxidants containing electrophilic oxygen atoms that react with nucleophilic alkenes to produce epoxides (oxiranes). You
can view epoxides as the oxygen analogues of bromonium ions, but unlike most bromonium
ions they are quite stable.

The simplest epoxide, ethylene oxide (or oxirane itself), can be produced on the tonne scale
by the direct oxidation of ethene with oxygen at high temperature over a silver catalyst. These
conditions are hardly suitable for general laboratory use, and the most commonly used epoxidizing agents are peroxy-carboxylic acids. These peroxy-acids (or peracids) have an extra oxygen
atom between the carbonyl group and their acidic hydrogen—they are esters of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). They are rather less acidic than carboxylic acids because their conjugate base is no
longer stabilized by delocalization into the carbonyl group. But they are electrophilic at the
oxygen shown here in green because attack there by a nucleophile displaces carboxylate, a good
leaving group. The LUMO of a peroxy-carboxylic acid is the σ* orbital of the weak O–O bond.

And now the curly arrow mechanism. The essence of the mechanism is attack by the π
orbital of the alkene on the weak, polarized, electrophilic O–O bond, which we can represent
most simply as shown in the margin. But, in the real reaction, a proton (shown in brown in
this mechanism) has transferred from the epoxide oxygen to the carboxylic acid by-product.
You can represent this all in one step if you draw the arrows carefully. Start with the nucleophilic π bond: send the electrons on to oxygen, breaking O–O and forming a new carbonyl
bond. Use those electrons to pick up the proton, and use the old O–H bond’s electrons to
make the second new C–O bond. Don’t be put off by the spaghetti effect—each arrow is quite
logical when you think the mechanism through. The transition state for the reaction makes
the bond-forming and -breaking processes clearer.

###### Epoxidation is stereospecifi c

Because both new C–O bonds are formed on the same face of the alkene’s π bond, the geometry of the alkene is refl ected in the stereochemistry of the epoxide. The reaction is therefore
stereospecifi c. Here are two examples demonstrating this: _cis-alkene gives_ _cis-epoxide and_
_trans-alkene gives trans-epoxide._

Peracids give epoxides from alkenes with any substitution pattern (except ones conjugated
with electron-withdrawing groups, for which a different reagent is required: see Chapter 22),
but the chart below shows how the rate varies according to the number of substituents on the

Not only are more substituted double bonds more stable (as you saw in Chapter 17), but they
are more nucleophilic. We showed you in Chapter 15 that alkyl groups are electron-donating
because they stabilize carbocations. This same electron-donating effect raises the energy of
the HOMO of a double bond and makes it more nucleophilic. You can think of it this way:
every C–C or C–H bond that can allow its σ orbital to interact with the π orbital of the alkene
will raise the HOMO of the alkene slightly, as shown by the energy level diagram. The more
substituents the alkene has, the more the energy is raised.

The differences in reactivity between alkenes of different substitution patterns can be
exploited to produce the epoxide only of the more reactive alkene of a pair, provided the
supply of oxidant is limited. In the fi rst example below, a tetrasubstituted alkene reacts in
preference to a cis disubstituted one. Even when two alkenes are equally substituted, the effect
of epoxidizing one of them is to reduce the nucleophilicity of the second (the new oxygen
atom is electron-withdrawing, and dienes are in general more nucleophilic than alkenes: see
below). The monoepoxide of cyclopentadiene is a useful intermediate and can be prepared by
direct epoxidation of the diene under buffered conditions.

###### Electrophilic addition to unsymmetrical alkenes is regioselective

In epoxidation reactions, and in electrophilic additions of bromine, each end of the alkene is
joined to the same sort of atom (Br or O). But in the addition reactions of other electrophiles,
H–Br for example, there is a choice: which carbon gets the H and which gets the Br? You will
need to be able to predict, and to explain, reactions of unsymmetrical alkenes with HBr, but we
should start by looking at the reaction with a symmetrical alkene—cyclohexene. This is what
happens. When H–Br reacts as an electrophile, it is attacked at H, losing Br [−]. Unlike a bromine
atom, a hydrogen atom can’t form a three-membered ring cation—it has no lone pairs to use.
So electrophilic addition of a proton (which is what this is) to an alkene gives a product best
represented as a carbocation. This carbocation rapidly reacts with the bromide ion just formed.
Overall, H–Br adds across the alkene. This is a useful way of making simple alkyl bromides.

In each case, the bromine atom ends up on the more substituted carbon, and the mechanism explains why. There are two possible outcomes for protonation of styrene by HBr, but
you should immediately be able to spot which is preferred, even if you don’t know the outcome of the reaction. Protonation at one end gives a stabilized benzylic cation, with its positive charge delocalized into the benzene ring.

The protonation of alkenes to give carbocations is quite general. The carbocations may trap
a nucleophile, as you have just seen, or they may simply lose a proton to give back an alkene.
This is just the same as saying the protonation is reversible, but it needn’t be the same proton
that is lost. A more stable alkene may be formed by losing a different proton, which means
that acid can catalyse the isomerization of alkenes—both between Z and E geometrical isomers and between regioisomers.

###### E1 and isomerization

The isomerization of alkenes in acid is probably a good part of the reason why E1 eliminations in acid generally give E
alkenes. In Chapter 17 we explained how kinetic control could lead to E alkenes: interconversion of E and Z alkenes under
the conditions of the reaction allows the thermodynamic product to prevail. This was also discussed in Chapter 12.

###### Electrophilic addition to dienes

Earlier in the chapter you saw the epoxidation of a diene to give a monoepoxide: only one of
the double bonds reacted. This is quite a usual observation: dienes are more nucleophilic than
isolated alkenes. This is easy to explain by looking at the relative energy of the HOMO of an
alkene and a diene—this discussion is on p. 138 of Chapter 7. Dienes are therefore very susceptible to protonation by acid to give a cation. This is what happens when 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene
(isoprene) is treated with acid. Protonation gives a stable delocalized allylic cation.

isoprene **H**

**H** **X**

Why protonate this double bond and not the other one? The cation you get by protonating
the other double bond is also allylic, but it cannot benefi t from the additional stabilization
from the methyl group because the positive charge is not delocalized on to the carbon carrying the methyl.
If the acid is HBr, then nucleophilic attack by Br on the cation follows. The cation is attacked
at the less hindered end to give the important compound prenyl bromide. This is very much
the sort of reaction you met in Chapter 15—it is the second half of an SN1 substitution reaction on an allylic compound.

This compound turns out to be the kinetic product of the bromination reaction.
The 1,4-dibromide is formed only when the reaction is heated, and is the thermodynamic
product. The mechanism is electrophilic attack on the diene to give a bromonium ion, which
bromide opens to give the dibromide. We have shown the bromide attacking the more
substituted end of the bromonium ion—although we can’t know this for sure (attack at either
end gives the same product), you are about to see (in the next section) evidence that this is the
usual course of reactions of unsymmetrical bromonium ions.

This 1,2-dibromide can still react further because it can undergo nucleophilic substitution.
Bromide is a good nucleophile and a good leaving group and, with an allylic system like this,
an SN1 reaction can take place in which both the nucleophile and the leaving group are bromide. The intermediate is a cation, but here the carbocation is disguised as the bromonium
ion because bromine’s lone pair can help stabilize the positive charge. Bromide can attack
where it left, returning to starting material, but it can also attack the far end of the allylic
system, giving the 1,4-dibromide. The steps are all reversible at higher temperatures, so the
fact that the 1,4-dibromide is formed under these conditions must mean it is more stable than
the 1,2-dibromide. It is not hard to see why: it has a more substituted double bond and the two
large bromine atoms are further apart.

###### Unsymmetrical bromonium ions open regioselectively

We ignored the issue of symmetry in the alkene when we discussed the bromination of alkenes because even unsymmetrical alkenes give the same 1,2-dibromides, whichever way the
bromide attacks the bromonium ion.

But when a bromination is done in a nucleophilic solvent—water or methanol, for
example—solvent molecules compete with the bromide to open the bromonium ion. As you
know, alcohols are much worse nucleophiles than bromide but, because the concentration of
solvent is so high (remember—the concentration of water in water is 55 M), the solvent gets
there fi rst most of the time. This is what happens when isobutene is treated with bromine in
methanol. An ether is formed by attack of methanol only at the more substituted end of the
bromonium ion. When a functional group can react in more than one position, the choice is
known as the regioselectivity of the reaction. We will return to the concept of regioselectivity
in Chapter 24.
Methanol is attacking the bromonium ion where it is most hindered, so there must be some
effect at work more powerful than steric hindrance. One way of looking at this is to reconsider
our assumption that bromonium ion opening is an SN2 process. Here, it hardly looks SN2. We
have a tertiary centre, so naturally you expect SN1, via the cation below. But we have already
said that cations like this can be stabilized by formation of the three-membered bromonium
ion and, if we let this happen, we have to attack the bromonium ion, which gets us back to
where we started: an SN2 mechanism!

The answer to the conundrum is that substitution reactions don’t always go by pure SN1 or
pure SN2 mechanisms: sometimes the mechanism is somewhere in between. Perhaps the leaving group starts to leave, creating a partial positive charge at carbon, which is intercepted by
the nucleophile. This provides a good explanation of what is going on here. The bromine
begins to leave and a partial positive charge builds up at carbon. The departure of bromine
can get to a more advanced state at the tertiary end than at the primary end because the substituents stabilize the build-up of positive charge. A more accurate representation of this
brom onium ion is shown in the margin, with one C–Br bond longer than the other and more
polarized than the other.
The nucleophile now has a choice: does it attack the more accessible, primary end of the
bromonium ion, or does it attack the more charged end with the weaker C–Br bond? Here, the
latter is clearly the faster reaction. The transition state has considerable positive charge on
carbon and is known as a loose SN2 transition state.

The products of bromination in water are called bromohydrins. They can be treated with
base, which deprotonates the alcohol. A rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction follows: bromide is
expelled as a leaving group and an epoxide is formed. This can be a useful alternative synthesis of epoxides avoiding peroxy-acids.

- Alkoxides are never leaving

###### The regioselectivity of epoxide opening can depend on the conditions

Although epoxides, like bromonium ions, contain strained three-membered rings, they
require either acid catalysis or a powerful nucleophile to react well. Compare these two reactions of a 1,1,2-trisubstituted epoxide. They are nucleophilic substitutions related to those we
introduced in Chapter 15 (p. 352) but in that chapter we carefully avoided discussing epoxides
of the unsymmetrical variety. In this example, the regiochemistry reverses with the reaction
conditions. Why?

We’ll start with the acid-catalysed reaction because it is more similar to the examples we
have just been discussing—opening happens at the more substituted end. Protonation by acid
produces a positively charged intermediate that bears a passing resemblance to the corresponding bromonium ion. The two alkyl groups make possible a build-up of charge on the
carbon at the tertiary end of the protonated epoxide, and methanol attacks here, just as it does
in the bromonium ion. You could think of the protonated leaving group ‘pulling’ the otherwise unreactive methanol in towards the reactive centre.

###### Electrophilic additions to alkenes can be stereospecifi c

Although they really belong in Chapter 15 with other nucleophilic substitution reactions, we
included the last few examples of epoxide-opening reactions here because they have many
things in common with the reactions of bromonium ions. Now we are going to make the analogy work the other way by looking at the stereochemistry of the reactions of bromonium ions,
and hence at the stereoselectivity of electrophilic additions to alkenes. We shall fi rst remind
you of an epoxide reaction from Chapter 15, where you saw this.

**H**



- The reaction is stereospecifi c
because it’s the stereochemistry
of the epoxide that determines
the outcome of the reaction. The
SN2 reaction has no choice but to
go with inversion. We discussed
the terms ‘stereospecifi c’ and
‘stereoselective’ on p. 396.

The epoxide ring opening is stereospecifi c: it is an SN2 reaction and it goes with inversion.
The epoxide starts on the top face of the ring and the amino group therefore ends up on the
bottom face. In other words, the two groups end up anti or trans across the ring. You now
know how to make this epoxide—you would use cyclopentene and m-CPBA, and in two steps
you could ‘add’ an OH group and a Me2N group anti across the double bond.

Bromination of alkenes is stereospecifi c because the geometry of the starting alkene determines which product diastereoisomer is obtained. We couldn’t demonstrate this with
cyclohexene because only a Z double bond is possible in a six-membered ring. But bromination or chlorination of Z and E-2-butene in acetic acid produces a single diastereoisomer in
each case, and they are different from each other. Anti addition occurs in both cases—more
evidence that a bromonium ion is the intermediate.

The stereochemistry of the products is a bit clearer if we redraw them, and in the scheme
below the product of each reaction is shown in two different ways. Firstly, the products have
been rotated to place the carbon chain in the plane of the paper: in this conformation you can
clearly see that there has been an anti addition across the E double bond. Secondly, the middle
bond has been twisted 180° to give an (unrealistically) eclipsed conformation. We show this
conformation for two reasons: now you can clearly see that there has been an anti addition
across the Z double bond too. It also makes it quite clear that the product of the E-butene
bromination is achiral: you can see the plane of symmetry in this conformation, and this is
why we haven’t placed (±) signs next to the products from the E alkene.

There is no change of confi guration, only changes of conformation to help you understand
what is going on. If you cannot follow any of the ‘redrawing’ steps, make a model. With practice, you will soon learn to manipulate mental models in your head, and to see what happens
to substituents when bonds are rotated. Most importantly, don’t let all of this more subtle
stereochemical discussion cloud the simple message:



- **Bromine undergoes anti addition to alkenes.**

###### Bromonium ions as intermediates in stereoselective synthesis

You will not be surprised to learn that the other nucleophiles (water and alcohols) you saw
intercepting bromonium ions earlier in the chapter also do so stereospecifi cally. The following reaction can be done on a large scale and produces a single diastereoisomer of the product
(racemic, of course) because water opens the bromonium ion with inversion.

###### N-Bromosuccinimide, NBS

The reagent used to form the bromonium ion here is called N-bromosuccinimide, or NBS for short. Unlike the noxious
brown liquid bromine, NBS is an easily handled crystalline solid and is perfect for electrophilic addition of bromine to
alkenes when the bromonium ion is not intended to be opened by Br [−]. It works by providing a very small concentration
of Br2 in solution: a small amount of HBr is enough to get the reaction going and thereafter every addition reaction
produces another molecule of HBr, which liberates more Br2 from NBS. In a sense, NBS is a source of ‘Br[+]’. NBS is known
to act as a source of Br2 because the results of reactions of NBS and of Br2 in low concentration are identical.

The reagent NBS generates only a low concentration of Br2, so the concentration of Br [−] is
always low and alcohols compete with Br [−] to open the epoxide even if they are not the solvent. In the next example, the alcohol is ‘propargyl alcohol’, prop-2-yn-1-ol. It gives the
expected anti-disubstituted product with cyclohexene and NBS.

When 1-methylcyclohexene is used as the starting material, there is additionally a question
of regioselectivity. The alcohol attacks the more hindered end of the bromonium ion—the
end where there can be greatest stabilization of the partial positive charge in the ‘loose SN2’
transition state (see p. 437). This reaction really does illustrate the way in which a mechanism
can lie in between SN1 and SN2. Confi gurational inversion, indicative of an SN2 reaction, happens at a tertiary centre, where you would usually expect SN1.

###### Adding two hydroxyl groups: dihydroxylation

Many important compounds—the carbohydrates, for example—have two hydroxyl groups
on adjacent carbon atoms. They are called 1,2-diols. A good way of making a 1,2-diol is to add
two hydroxyl groups across a double bond. This can be done in two ways, each of which can
give a different diastereoisomer of the product.
The fi rst way uses chemistry you have already met. When a nucleophile opens an epoxide,
it generates an alcohol. If the nucleophile is water, the product is the diol. The epoxide opening in an SN2 reaction goes with stereochemical inversion, so in this example the two hydroxyl
groups end up on opposite sides of the six-membered ring: the product is an anti diol. The
epoxide opening reaction can be done in acid or in base.

To get the syn diol, a completely different method is used, involving the reagent osmium
tetroxide, OsO4. OsO4 reacts with alkenes to deliver two hydroxyl groups—one to each end of
the double bond—in a single step. Because both groups are delivered at the same time, they
are always syn to one another: OsO4 carries out a syn dihydroxylation of the double bond.
The mechanism of the reaction is different from ones you have met before and goes like
this: the Os starts as tetrahedral osmium(VIII) and ends up as osmium(VI). The immediate
product of the reaction is an osmate ester, but these reactions are carried out in the presence
of water, and hydrolysis always follows on fast, giving the diol.

- The mechanism of this
reaction, in which the arrows go
round in a ring and end where
they started, is termed pericyclic:
we shall discuss this in detail in
Chapter 34.


Because Os(VI) is produced in the reaction, and a simple oxidation will restore it to Os(VIII),
the most effective version of this reaction makes use of just a catalytic amount of Os(VIII) and
a stoichiometric amount of a reoxidant, often the compound NMO, or N-methylmorpholine_N-oxide. In the example below there is only one new chiral centre, so no possibility of_
diastereoisomers.

- There is more discussion of
this idea in the context of
bromination on p. 440. It is
worthwhile thinking about the
chirality of these two products
too: the fi rst is chiral, with no
plane of symmetry (we have
included the symbol (±) to remind
you that although we have
necessarily drawn just one
enantiomer here, it must be
racemic); the second is achiral,
with a plane of symmetry in the
fi rst conformation shown and a
centre of symmetry in the second.
If this is not clear to you, look
back at Chapter 15.


Because OsO4 adds two hydroxyl groups to an alkene in a syn fashion, the overall product
depends on the geometry of the alkene starting material: it is stereospecifi c. It is similar to
bromination (p. 439) in that respect, although of course bromination is an anti addition. You
can see how two different diastereoisomers are produced from different alkenes in these two
examples: both dihydroxylations are mechanistically syn, but redrawing the product from
the Z alkene in its more extended form reveals anti stereochemistry.

###### Breaking a double bond completely: periodate cleavage and ozonolysis

Sometimes it can be necessary to cleave a double bond completely, in other words to oxidize not
just its π bond (as you have seen with Br2 and OsO4) but its σ bond too, as shown in the margin.
This can be done in two steps using OsO4 in conjunction with the reagent sodium periodate,
NaIO4. The diol product forms a periodate ester, which decomposes to give two molecules of
aldehyde by a cyclic mechanism similar to that for the OsO4 step. The NaIO4 also reoxidizes the
Os(VI) to Os(VIII) so only a catalytic amount of Os is required.

The process proceeds by two successive oxidations—fi rst of the π, and then the σ bond—
with different reagents (which can be added in one step or in two—you can use NaIO4 to
cleave any diol, whether or not you made it using OsO4). But there is another reagent that will
achieve double oxidation in one step: ozone.
Ozone is a symmetrical bent molecule with a central positively charged oxygen atom and
two terminal oxygen atoms that share a negative charge. Ozone is unstable, and is generated
immediately before use from oxygen (using a device called an ‘ozonizer’) and bubbled into the
reaction mixture. Like OsO4, it adds to alkenes by a cyclic mechanism: the product is a fi vemembered ring with three oxygen atoms. It is extremely unstable and collapses by breaking a
weak O–O bond and a C–C σ bond, but gains two strong C=O bonds in the process.

mild reducing agent such as dimethyl sulfi de, Me2S, or triphenylphopshine, Ph3P, removes the
‘spare’ oxygen and reveals the two aldehydes.
This cleavage of an alkene by ozone is an important reaction and is known as ozonolysis.
Ozonolysis can be used to generate not only aldehydes, but also other functional groups.
Completing the reaction with oxidizing agents such as H2O2 will give carboxylic acids,
and more powerful reducing agents such as NaBH4 will give alcohols. Here are the overall
transformations:

Ozonolysis of cyclohexenes is particularly useful as it gives 1,6-dicarbonyl compounds that

a monomer for nylon manufacture.

###### Adding one hydroxyl group: how to add water across a double bond

In Chapter 17 you saw alkenes being made from alcohols by E1 elimination—dehydration—
under acid catalysis. The question we are going to answer in this section is: how can you make
this elimination run backwards—in other words, how can you hydrate a double bond?
It is possible on occasion simply to use aqueous acid to do this. The reaction works only if
protonation of the alkene can give a stable, tertiary cation. The cation is then trapped by the
aqueous solvent.


In general, though, it is diffi cult to predict whether aqueous acid will hydrate the alkene or
dehydrate the alcohol. The method we are about to show you is much more reliable. The key
is to use a transition metal to help you out. Alkenes are soft nucleophiles (p. 357) and interact
well with soft electrophiles such as transition metal cations. In the margin, for example, is the
complex formed between an alkene and mercury(II) cation. The complex should remind you
of a bromonium ion, and rightly so because its reactions are similar. Even relatively feeble
nucleophiles such as water and alcohols, when used as the solvent, open the ‘mercurinium’
ion and give alcohols and ethers. In the next scheme, the mercury(II) is supplied as mercury(II)
acetate, Hg(OAc)2, which we shall represent with two covalent Hg–O bonds. Unsurprisingly,
water attacks at the more substituted end of the positively charged mercurinium ion.

- The demercuration step
involves radical chemistry, which
is discussed in Chapter 37. You
will fi nd much more on
organometallic compounds and
their reactions in Chapter 40.


We’ve added OH and Hg(II) across the alkene, and the reaction is termed an ‘oxymercuration’. But a problem remains: how to get rid of the metal. The C–Hg bond is very weak and the
simplest way to replace Hg with H is by using a reducing agent: NaBH4 works fi ne.
Below is an example of oxymercuration–demercuration at work. The intermediate mercury
compound is not isolated.

But the product isolated from an alkyne oxymercuration is in fact a ketone. You can see why
if you just allow a proton on this initial product to shift from oxygen to carbon—fi rst protonate at C then deprotonate at O. C=O bonds are stronger than C=C bonds, and this simple
reaction is very fast.

We now have a ketone, but we also still have the mercury. That is no problem when there is
a carbonyl group adjacent because any weak nucleophile can remove mercury in the presence
of acid, as shown below. Finally, another proton transfer (from O to C again) gives the real
product of the reaction: a ketone.

###### Hydroboration

These methods for adding water across a double or triple bond involve cationic intermediates,
and always end up putting the new hydroxyl group at the position best able to stabilize a positive charge (see p. 433). By what about addition of water the other way round? How would you
do the reaction in the margin for example?
The answer is to make use of yet another element: boron. Boranes, including both BH3 itself
and analogues with one or two alkyl groups, HBR2 (an important example is shown in the
margin), add to alkenes to make a new C–H bond and a new C–B bond by a mechanism we
can write like this. The alkene pushes electrons into the boron’s empty p orbital, while the
hydrogen transfers onto the alkene.

- Why does B end up on the
less substituted carbon? This is
partly due to electronics—the
reaction is driven by donation of
the alkene’s π electrons into the
empty p orbital of the boron
atom, so positive charge builds
up at the other (more substituted)
end of the alkene—and partly
due to steric factors—BR2 is
bigger than H, so it ends up
where there is less steric
hindrance. One of the reasons for
using the borane 9-BBN above is
that the B atom is made very
bulky by the bicyclic ring system.


Importantly, if the alkene is unsymmetrical, the boron tends to end up on the less substituted carbon atom. This reaction can happen several times so, for example, if you start with
an alkene and BH3, you will typically end up with a trialkylborane:


So far so good, if you want to make boranes, but we started out this section posing ourselves
the problem of adding water across a double bond. This is where a quirk of boron chemistry
helps us out. The C–B bond(s) we have just created can be oxidized to C–O bonds by using a
mixture of NaOH and H2O2. The mixture generates the hydroperoxide anion HO–O[−], which
adds to that important empty p orbital on boron. The product is a negatively charged structure, shown below.

This is not stable, and it can decompose by a mechanism you should look at closely. It is not
one which is familiar to you, but it makes sense if you think about it. The O–O bond is weak
and can break, losing HO[−]. As it does so, one of the alkyl groups on boron can migrate from B
to O, relieving the boron atom of its negative charge, to give the structure shown below.

This mechanism, in which a
C–B bond is exchanged for another
C–X bond, is typical reactivity for
boron. It has some similarity also
with the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation,
Chapter 36.


We now have the C–O bond where we want it, and all that has to happen is for the hydroxide
anion to come back in and displace B from the alcohol product. The product, on protonation, is
our alcohol. How can we be sure the correct R group will migrate? Well, if we use BH3 we will get
a trialkyborane, where all three groups on boron are the same, and all three C–B bonds can be
oxidized one after another. If we use the HBR2 reagent 9-BBN, then only the non-cyclic substituent formed in the hydroboration reaction will migrate, selectively giving us the product we want.

###### To conclude...a synopsis of electrophilic addition reactions

Electrophilic addition to double bonds gives three-membered ring intermediates with Br2,
with Hg[2][+], and with peroxy-acids (in which case the three-membered rings are stable and are
called epoxides). All three classes of three-membered rings react with nucleophiles to give
1,2-difunctionalized products with control over (1) regioselectivity and (2) stereoselectivity.
Protonation of a double bond gives a cation, which also traps nucleophiles, and this reaction
can be used to make alkyl halides. Some of the sorts of compounds you can make by the methods of this chapter are shown below.

We make no apologies for the number of pages we have devoted to carbonyl chemistry. The
fi rst reactions you met, in Chapter 6, involved carbonyl compounds. Then in Chapters 9, 10,
and 11 we considered different aspects of nucleophilic attack on electrophilic carbonyl compounds. But carbonyl compounds have two opposed sides to their characters. They can be
nucleophilic as well: electrophilic attack on aldehydes, ketones, and acid derivatives is a useful
reaction too. How can the same class of compound be subject to both nucleophilic and electrophilic attack? The resolution of this paradox is the subject of this chapter, where we shall
see that most carbonyl compounds exist in two forms—one electrophilic and one nucleophilic. The electrophilic form is the carbonyl compound itself and the nucleophilic form is
called the enol.

###### Would you accept a mixture of compounds as a pure substance?

You can buy dimedone (5,5-dimethylcyclohexane-1,3-dione) from chemical suppliers. If, as is
wise when you buy any compound, you run an NMR spectrum of the compound to check on
its purity, you might be inclined to send the compound back. In CDCl3 solution it is clearly a
mixture of two compounds. Overleaf you can see [1]H and [13]C NMR spectra of the mixture,
with the peaks of the dione in red.

group, and importantly a sharp signal at δH 5.5 in the double-bond region. It also has two dif_ferent sp[2] carbon atoms. All this fi ts the enol structure below._

###### Tautomerism: formation of enols by proton transfer

An enol is exactly what the name implies: an ene-ol. It has a C=C double bond and an OH
group joined directly to it. In the case of dimedone, the enol must be formed by a transfer of
a proton from the central CH2 group of the keto form to one of the OH groups, a reaction
known as enolization.

tautomerism in a carboxylic acid tautomerism in an imidazole

This sort of chemistry was discussed in Chapter 8, where the acidity and basicity of atoms were the prime considerations.
In the fi rst case the two tautomers are the same and so the equilibrium constant must be exactly 1 (the mixture must be
exactly 50:50). In the second case (imidazole-containing compounds appear on p. 178) the equilibrium will lie on one
side or the other depending on the nature of R.

###### Why don’t simple aldehydes and ketones exist as enols?

When we were looking at the spectra of carbonyl compounds in Chapters 13 and 18 we saw
no signs of enols in IR or NMR spectra. Dimedone is exceptional (we will discuss why later)
and while any carbonyl compound with protons adjacent to the carbonyl group can enolize,
simpler carbonyl compounds like cyclohexanone or acetone have only a trace of enol present
under ordinary conditions. The equilibrium lies well over towards the keto form (the equilibrium constant K for acetone enolization is about 10[−][6]).
This is because the combination of a C=C double bond and an O–H single bond is (slightly)
less stable than the combination of a C=O double bond and a C–H single bond. The balance
between the bond energies is quite fi ne. On the one hand, the O–H bond in the enol is a
stronger bond than the C–H bond in the ketone but, on the other hand, the C=O bond of the
ketone is much stronger than the C=C bond of the enol. Some average values for these bonds
are shown on the right.
Typical amounts of enols in solution are about one part in 10[5] for normal ketones. So why
do we think they are important? Because enolization is just a proton transfer, it is occurring all the
_time even though we cannot detect the minute proportion of the enol. Let’s look at the evidence for_
this statement.

###### Evidence for the equilibration of carbonyl compounds with enols

If you dissolve a simple carbonyl compound (for example, 1-phenylpropan-1-one, ‘propiophenone’) in D2O and run a series of [1]H NMR spectra over a period of time, the signal for protons
next to the carbonyl group very slowly disappears. If the compound is isolated from the solution afterwards, the mass spectrum shows that those hydrogen atoms have been replaced by
deuterium atoms: there is a peak at (M + 1)[+] or (M + 2)[+] instead of at M[+]

Enolization usually means losing a proton from C and gaining one at O. But in D2O all of
the ‘protons’ are in fact ‘deuterons’ (D[+], or [2]H[+]), so initially an enol with an ‘OD’ group
forms. This doesn’t matter, though, because when the enol form reverts to the keto form, it
loses the D from O. But what does matter is that it also picks up a deuteron instead of a proton at C.



- Notice that the double bond
in this enol could be either E or
Z. It is drawn as Z here, but in
reality is probably a mixture of
both, although this is irrelevant
to the reaction. We shall not be
concerned with the geometry of
enols in this chapter, but there
are some reactions that you will
meet in later chapters where it
is important, and you need to
appreciate that the possibility
exists.

The process can now be repeated: either the D or the H could be lost this time, but eventually it is certain that the huge excess of D over H in the solvent will mean that both H atoms
adjacent to the carbonyl group are replaced by D.

- Something else will happen
to the proton NMR spectrum.
The signal for the CH3 group
was a triplet in the original
ketone, but when those two Hs
are replaced by Ds, it becomes a
singlet. In the carbon spectrum,
coupling to deuterium appears:
remember the shape of the
CDCl3 peak (Chapter 18).



- In Chapter 17 (p. 388) we
discussed the equivalence of
mechanisms showing protons just
‘falling off’ with those in which
basic solvent molecules are
involved to remove a proton. In
this chapter, and in the rest of the
book, you will see both variants in
use according to the context. They
mean exactly the same thing.


We can detect this exchange by the slow disappearance of the 2H signal for the protons on
the carbon next to the carbonyl group. There are, of course, eight other hydrogen atoms in the
molecule but they are not affected by enolization.

###### Enolization is catalysed by acids and bases

Enolization is, in fact, quite a slow process in neutral solution, even in D2O (the exchange
described above might take place over a period of hours to days at room temperature), and we
would catalyse it with acid or base if we really wanted it to happen fast. In the acid-catalysed
reaction, the molecule is fi rst protonated on oxygen and then loses a proton from C in a second step. We shall use a different example here to show that aldehydes form enols too, but
acid or base will catalyse enolization of any carbonyl compound in the same way.

This is a more detailed mechanism for enolization than those we have been drawing because
it shows that something (here a water molecule) must actually be removing the proton from
carbon. Although this reaction will occur faster than the uncatalysed enolization, the equilibrium is not changed and we still cannot detect the enol spectroscopically.
In the base-catalysed reaction the C–H proton is removed fi rst by the base, say a hydroxide
ion, and the proton added to the oxygen atom in a second step.

This is a good mechanism too because it shows that something must remove the proton
from carbon and something (here a water molecule—we don’t, of course, have protons available in basic solution) must put the proton on the oxygen atom.
Notice that both of these reactions are genuinely catalytic. You get the proton back again (in
the form of H3O[+]) at the end of the acid-catalysed mechanism, and you get the hydroxide ion
back again at the end of the base-catalysed mechanism.

###### The intermediate in the base-catalysed reaction is an enolate ion

There are some more insights to be gained from the base-catalysed reaction. The intermediate
anion is called the enolate ion. It is the conjugate base of the enol and can be formed either

simple heteroatom-based electrophiles.

###### Summary of types of enol and enolate

Time to recap and summarize the various kinds of enol and enolate that can form from carbonyl compounds. You have already seen that ketones and aldehydes enolize. With an
unsymmetrical ketone, more than one enol or enolate ion is possible.

The carbonyl group is accepting electrons in both the enolization step and the nucleophilic attack. The same compounds that are the most electrophilic are also the most easily
enolizable. This makes acyl chlorides very enolizable. To avoid nucleophilic attack, we cannot use chloride ion as base since chloride is not basic, so we must use a non-nucleophilic
base such as a tertiary amine. The resulting enolate is not stable as it can eliminate chloride
ion, a good leaving group, to form a ketene. This works particularly well in making dichloroketene from dichloroacetyl chloride as the proton to be removed is very acidic.

**Amides (unless they are tertiary) also have rather acidic protons, though not, of course, as**

of all acid derivatives, and their enols and enolates are rarely used in reactions.

With a primary amine (here PhNH2) a reasonably stable imine is formed, but with a secondary amine (here a simple cyclic amine) the imine itself cannot be formed and the iminium salt
is less stable than the enamine.
Just as enamines are the nitrogen analogues of enols, aza-enolates are the nitrogen analogues of enolates. They are made by deprotonating enamines with strong base. Nitroalkanes
are much more acidic and form enolate-like anions in quite weak base.


You will see both enamines
and aza-enolates in action in
Chapters 25 and 26. Deprotonation
of nitroalkanes is discussed in

- **Requirement for enolization**

**Any organic compound with an electron-withdrawing functional group, with at least one π bond**
**joined to a saturated carbon atom having at least one hydrogen atom, may form an enol in**
**neutral or acid solution. Many also form enolates in basic solution (exceptions being carboxylic**
**acids, and primary and secondary amides).**


The enols will probably not be detectable in solution (only about one part in 10[4]–10[6] is enol
for most compounds). Some compounds by contrast form stable enols, and we’ll look at these
next, before coming back to how enols and enolates react.

###### Stable enols

We have established that the enol is, in general, less stable than the keto form of the molecule.
We might hope to see stable enols if we changed that situation by adding some feature to the
molecule that stabilized the enol thermodynamically. Or we might try to create an enol that
would revert only slowly to the keto form—in other words, it would be kinetically stable. We
shall look at this type fi rst.

###### Kinetically stable enols

The formation of enols is catalysed by acids and bases. The reverse of this reaction—the formation of ketone from enol—must therefore also be catalysed by the same acids and bases. If
you prepare simple enols in the strict absence of acid or base they have a reasonably long
lifetime. A famous example is the preparation of the simplest enol, vinyl alcohol, by heating
ethane-1,2-diol (glycol—antifreeze) to very high temperatures (900 °C) at low pressure. Water
is lost and the enol of acetaldehyde is formed. It survives long enough for its proton NMR
spectrum to be run, but gives acetaldehyde slowly.

The spectrum illustrates the electronic effect of the oxygen atom on the double bond. The
alkene proton next to OH (in green) is deshielded and the two alkene protons on the other
carbon atom (in orange) are shielded as you would expect from the feeding of electrons into
the double bond by the OH group. The coupling constants across the double bond are as
expected too: a large trans coupling (14.0 Hz) and a smaller cis coupling (6.5 Hz). The very
small geminal coupling is typical of a terminal double bond CH2 group.
Other enols can be made that are stable because it is very diffi cult for the carbon atom to be
protonated. In the example on the right, the two substituted benzene rings crowd the enol
and prevent approach of a protonating agent. The rings twist out of the plane of the double
bond and shield both faces of the enol from attack by a proton.

###### Thermodynamically stable enols: 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds

We started this chapter by looking at a molecule that contained about 33% enol in solution—
dimedone (shown on the right). In fact, this is just one example of the class of 1,3-dicarbonyl
compounds (also called β-dicarbonyls), many of which contain substantial amounts of enol
and may even be completely enolized in polar solvents.
We need now to examine why these enols are so stable. The main reason is that this unique
(1,3) arrangement of the two carbonyl groups leads to enols that are conjugated—rather like a
carboxylic acid.

Look back at the NMR spectrum of dimedone (p. 450) and you’ll see that the two CH2
groups within the ring seem to be the same, although they are different (a and b)—even the
delocalization we have just proposed does not make them equivalent. This must mean that
the enol is in rapid equilibrium with another identical enol. This is _not delocalization—a_
proton is moving—so it is tautomerism.

- Again, note carefully the
difference between this
**tautomerism, in which a proton**
is moved around the molecule
and the structures are linked by
equilibrium arrows, and
**delocalization (conjugation),**
where only electrons are ‘moved’
(no actual movement occurs, of
course) and the two structures
are linked by one double-headed
arrow as they are just two ways
of drawing the same thing.


Once again, this is very like the situation in a carboxylic acid. The two enols equilibrate
(tautomerize) so fast in CDCl3 solution that the NMR spectrometer records an ‘averaged’ spectrum. By contrast, equilibration between the enol and keto forms is suffi ciently slow that the
NMR spectrometer records separate signals for the keto and enol forms.
Other 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds also exist largely in the enol form. In some examples
there is an additional stabilizing factor, intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Acetylacetone
(propane-2,4-dione) has a symmetrical enol stabilized by conjugation. The enol form is also
stabilized by a very favourable intramolecular hydrogen bond in a six-membered ring.

The hydrogen-bonded enol structure looks unsymmetrical, but in fact, as with dimedone, the
two identical enol structures interconvert rapidly by proton transfer, that is, by tautomerism.
The 1,3-dicarbonyl compound need not be symmetrical, and if it is not then two different
enol forms will interconvert by proton transfer. Below is a cyclic keto-aldehyde that exists
entirely as a pair of rapidly equilibrating enols. The proportions of the three species can be
measured by NMR: there is <1% keto-aldehyde, 76% of the fi rst enol, and 24% of the second.

The ultimate in stable enols has to be the Ph-enol. Aromatic alcohols, or phenols, which
prefer the substantial advantage of aromaticity to the slight advantage of a C=O over a C=C
double bond. They exist entirely in the phenol form. Like ascorbic acid, phenol is also quite
acidic (pKa 10)—it used to be called carbolic acid.



- You will see in Chapter 21,
however, that intermediates with
this ‘keto’ structure are formed in
reactions on the benzene ring of
phenols.

###### Consequences of enolization

 Unsaturated carbonyl compounds prefer to be conjugated

It is diffi cult to keep a β,γ-unsaturated carbonyl compound because the double bond tends to
move into conjugation with the carbonyl group in the presence of traces of acid or base. The
intermediate is, of course, an enol in acid solution but an enolate ion in base.

Protonation at the α position takes the molecule back to the unconjugated ketone, but

###### Racemization


Any stereogenic centre next to a carbonyl group is precarious because enolization will destroy
it. It would be foolish to try and make optically active β-keto esters whose only stereogenic
centre was between the two carbonyl groups. Although the keto-ester is chiral, the enol is fl at
and cannot be chiral. The two forms are in rapid equilibrium so all optical activity would
quickly be lost.

Compounds with one carbonyl group next to the stereogenic centre can be made but care
still needs to be taken. The α amino acids, the component parts of proteins, are like this.
They are perfectly stable and do not racemize in aqueous acid or base. In base they exist as
carboxylate anions that do not enolize, as explained above. Enolization in acid is prevented
by the –NH3+ group, which inhibits the protonation of the carbonyl group necessary for enol
formation.
Amino acids can be converted into their N-acetyl derivatives with acetic anhydride. These
_N-acetyl amides can be racemized on recrystallization from hot acetic acid, no doubt by enoli-_
zation. The amino group is no longer basic, and is not protonated in acid, so protonation on
the carbonyl group and hence enolization is now possible.

- We discussed resolution, the
separation of enantiomers by the
formation of diastereoisomers
with an optically active resolving
agent, in Chapter 14.


You may think it a crazy idea to want to racemize an amino acid. Supposing, however, that
you are preparing a pure (S)-amino acid from a racemate by resolution. Half your material
ends up as the wrong (R)-enantiomer and you don’t want just to throw it away. If you racemize
it you can put it back into the next resolution and convert half of it into the (S)-acid. Then you
can racemize what remains and so on.

###### Racemization in vivo

Some compounds may be racemized inside the human body. Bacterial cell walls are built partly from ‘unnatural’
(R)-amino-acids, which humans can’t digest. But we can use enzymes to racemize them.
There is an important group of analgesic (pain-killing) drugs, such as ibuprofen, based on the aryl-propionic acid
structure. Ibuprofen can be bought over the counter in chemists’ shops as Nurofen. Only the (S)-enantiomer of ibuprofen is an effective painkiller but the compound is administered as the racemate. The body does the rest, racemizing the
compound by enolizing it.

###### Reaction with enols or enolates as intermediates

We have already seen that exchange of hydrogen for deuterium, movement of double bonds
into conjugation, and racemization can occur with enols or enolates as intermediates. These
are chemical reactions of a sort, but it is time to look at some reactions that make signifi cant
changes to the carbonyl compound.

###### Halogenation

Carbonyl compounds can be halogenated in the α position by halogens (such as bromine, Br2)
in acidic or basic solutions. We shall look at the acid-catalysed reaction fi rst because it is
simpler. Ketones can usually be cleanly brominated using acetic acid as solvent.


**O** **Br2** **O**

**HOAc**

The fi rst step is acid-catalysed enolization and the electrophilic bromine molecule then
attacks the nucleophilic carbon of the enol. The arrows show why this particular carbon is the
one attacked.

Notice that the acid catalyst is regenerated at the end of the reaction. The reaction need not
be carried out in an acidic solvent, or even with a protic acid at all. Lewis acids make excellent
catalysts for the bromination of ketones. This example with an unsymmetrical ketone gives
100% yield of the bromoketone with catalytic AlCl3 in ether as solvent.

**O** **O**

**Br2,** 100% yield

Bromination occurs nowhere else in the molecule—not on the benzene ring (which, as you
will see in the next chapter, it easily might under these conditions), nor on any other atom of
the aliphatic side chain. This is because only one position can form an enol and the enol is
more reactive towards bromine than the aromatic ring.

- We have introduced a slight
but unimportant variation to this
mechanism. In the previous
mechanism, we used the lone
pairs on oxygen to assist attack
on Br2 and then lost the acid
catalyst in a separate step. Here,
we have written AlCl3 leaving as
the Br2 is attacked. The difference
is not signifi cant, and you will see
mechanisms written in both ways.
The second way saves a step, of
course.

These mechanisms should remind you of alkene bromination (p. 427)—except that here the
attack on the bromine is assisted by an electron pair on oxygen. Enols are more nucleophilic
than simple alkenes—the HOMO is raised by the interaction with the oxygen’s lone pairs and
looks not unlike the HOMO of the enolate anion we discussed on p. 453. The product, instead
of being a bromonium ion (which would undergo further reactions), loses a proton (or the
Lewis acid) to give a ketone.

Bromination of acid derivatives is usually carried out not on the acid itself but by converting
it to an acyl bromide or chloride, which is not isolated but gives the α-bromoacyl halide via
the enol. This used to be done in one step with red phosphorus and bromine, but a two-step


-----

- In the reaction of the
bromoacyl chloride with
methanol, attack occurs at the
carbonyl group with an alcohol
because oxygen nucleophiles are
‘hard’ nucleophiles (controlled by
charge interactions). If we want
to displace the σ-bromo group
we can use any ‘soft’ (orbitaldominated) nucleophile.
Triphenylphosphine (Ph3P) is
particularly important—the
product is a phosphonium salt,
employed in Wittig reactions and
discussed in Chapters 11 and 27.

substitution reactions are
discussed in Chapter 15.

- Notice that the hydroxide ion
is not regenerated in this
reaction—bromide ion is not
basic and does not react with
water to regenerate hydroxide ion
(Chapter 8). We therefore need to
add a whole equivalent of
hydroxide.


The formation of the acyl chloride with SOCl2 and the conversion of the α-bromoacyl chloride into the bromoester with MeOH are simple nucleophilic substitutions at the carbonyl
group, as described in Chapter 10. The intermediate stage, the bromination of the very easily
enolized acyl chloride, is a typical enol bromination.

###### Base-promoted halogenation

In base, bromination is different and more complicated because it usually won’t stop with the
introduction of one halogen atom. We’ll use the bromination of acetone as our example: the
fi rst step will now be a base-catalysed enolization to give the enolate ion instead of the enol.
The enolate ion can attack a bromine molecule in a very similar way to the attack of the enol
on bromine. The enolate will, of course, be even more reactive than the enol (the enolate
carries a negative charge).

The problem is that the reaction does not stop at this point. The fi rst step was the removal
of a proton and the protons between the carbonyl group and the bromine atom in the product
are _more acidic than those in the original acetone because of the electron-withdrawing_
bromine atom. Bromoacetone forms an enolate faster than acetone does.

more quickly. The fi rst product observable in any amount is tribromoacetone.

But even this is not the end of the story. To see why, we need to backtrack a bit. You may
already have asked yourself, ‘Why doesn’t the hydroxide ion, being a nucleophile, attack the
carbonyl group?’ This is a general question you might ask about all enolizations in base. The
answer is that it does. The reaction is shown in the margin. A tetrahedral intermediate forms.
What can happen now? This tetrahedral intermediate will revert to a carbonyl compound
by expelling the best leaving group. Me[−] can never act as a leaving group: the only possible
leaving group is the hydroxide ion (pKa of water = 15.7), so it just drops out again.
This state of affairs continues until we reach the tribromoketone. The CBr3− group now has a
chance to be a leaving group since the carbanion is stabilized by three bromine atoms. A real
reaction occurs:

The same thing happens with iodine, and we can summarize the whole process with iodine
using a general structure for a carbonyl compound bearing a methyl group. It must be a methyl
group because three halogens are necessary to make the carbanion into a leaving group.
This reaction is often called the ‘iodoform’ reaction. Iodoform was an old name for triiodomethane, just as chloroform is still used for trichloromethane. It is one of the rare
cases where nucleophilic substitution at a carbonyl group results in the cleavage of a C–C
single bond.

###### Nitrosation of enols

Now for a reaction with nitrogen as an electrophile that illustrates enol reactivity and reminds
us that tautomerism happens with functional groups other than the carbonyl. Let us suppose
you have a carbonyl compound and wish to introduce another carbonyl group next to the
fi rst. One way you might go about it is like this:

The fi rst step involves the formation of the weak acid nitrous acid (HNO2 or, more helpfully,
HONO) from the sodium salt and the strong acid HCl. Nitrous acid is itself protonated and
then loss of water creates the reactive electrophile NO[+].

The nitroso compound is unstable because it can tautomerize with the transfer of a proton
from carbon to the oxygen of the nitroso group. This process is exactly like enolization but
with N=O in the place of the C=O group. It gives an oxime as the stable ‘enol’. The oxime’s
O–H can form an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the ketone carbonyl group. Hydrolysis
of the oxime reveals the second ketone.

Before we move on to any more reactions, we want you to take away this message from the
reactions of enols and enolates with Br2 and with NO[+]:



- **Enols and enolates generally react with electrophiles at carbon.**


###### Stable equivalents of enolate ions

 Lithium enolates

Even with fairly strong bases such as hydroxides or alkoxides, most carbonyl compounds are
converted to their enolates only to a very small extent. A typical value for the pKa of protons
adjacent (α) to a carbonyl group is 20–25, while the pKa of methanol is around 16, so we can
only hope for about 1 part enolate in 10[4] parts carbonyl compound. With a much stronger
base this all changes, and the enolate is formed quantitatively from the carbonyl compound.
This is a very important result that we shall capitalize on in Chapters 25 and 26. The base
usually used is LDA (lithium diisopropylamide), and it works like this.



- You have already met LDA in
Chapter 17, promoting
elimination reactions (p. 398),
but no other use of this base
compares in importance with
what we are telling you now. By
far the most important use of
LDA is for making lithium
enolates.

- Never try to use BuLi to
deprotonate a carbonyl
compound! BuLi almost invariably
adds to carbonyl groups as a
nucleophile.


LDA is bulky, so it does not take part in nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl group, and it is
basic—the pKa of diisopropylamine is about 35, which is plenty basic enough to deprotonate
next to any carbonyl group. The lithium enolate is stable at low temperature (–78 °C) but reactive enough to be useful. Lithium enolates are the most commonly used stable enolate equivalents in chemistry.

###### Silyl enol ethers

Second only to lithium enolates in usefulness are silyl enol ethers. Silicon is less electropositive than lithium, and silyl enol ethers are more stable, and less reactive, than lithium
enolates. They are made by treating an enolate with a silicon electrophile. Silicon electrophiles invariably react with enolates at the oxygen atom fi rstly because they are hard (see
pp. 357 and 467) and secondly because of the very strong Si–O single bond. The most common silicon electrophile is trimethylsilyl chloride (Me3SiCl), an intermediate made industrially in bulk and used to make the NMR standard tetramethylsilane (Me4Si).
Silicon–oxygen bonds are so strong that silicon reacts with carbonyl compounds on oxygen
even without a strong base to form the enolate: the reaction probably goes through the small
amount of enol present in neutral solution and just needs a weak base (Et3N) to remove the
proton from the product. An alternative view is that the silicon reacts with oxygen fi rst, and
the base just converts the oxonium ion to the silyl enol ether. Both mechanisms are given
below—either might be correct. This is one of the two best ways to make a stable enol derivative from virtually any enolizable carbonyl compound.

Occasionally, it can be useful to run this reaction in reverse, generating the lithium enolate
from the silyl enol ether. This can be done with methyllithium, which takes part in nucleophilic substitution at silicon to generate the lithium enolate plus tetramethylsilane.

We shall be returning to silyl enol ethers and lithium enolates later in the book, but for the
moment you should view them simply as enol derivatives that are stable enough to be formed
quantitatively from carbonyl compounds before being used in further reactions.

###### Enol and enolate reactions at oxygen: preparation of enol ethers

You have just seen that silyl enol ethers are easy to make. But, if enolate ions have most of their
negative charge on the oxygen atom, it ought to be possible to make ordinary, carbon-based
ethers from them too. It is—but only under strange conditions. Normally, enols and enolate
ions prefer to react with alkylating agents (such as alkyl halides) at carbon, as we shall see in
Chapter 25. If enolate ions are prepared with potassium bases in dipolar aprotic solvents (such
as dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) that cannot solvate the oxygen anion, and are treated with
dimethylsulfate or trimethyloxonium ion—powerful methylating agents that react best with
charged atoms—some at least of the enol ether is formed. The Me3O[+] ion is found in the stable
(though reactive) compound trimethyloxonium tetrafl uoroborate, or Meerwein’s salt,
Me3O[+]BF4−. This compound and dimethylsulfate, Me2SO4, are hard electrophiles with highly
polarized C–O bonds which therefore react with the enolate at hard O rather than soft C.

The yield in this reaction is about 60–70% of enol ether, the rest being mainly C-alkylated

These enol ethers are rather unstable, particularly towards acid-catalysed hydrolysis (as
described in the next section) and are not as useful as the silyl enol ethers. We shall next look
at the enol-like reactions of both groups of enol ethers.

###### Reactions of enol ethers

 Hydrolysis of enol ethers

Enols have an OH group and are alcohols of a sort. Normal alcohols form stable ethers that are
diffi cult to convert back to the alcohol. Powerful reagents such as HI or BBr3 are required and
these reactions were discussed in Chapter 15. The reaction with HI is an SN2 attack on the
methyl group of the protonated ether and that is why a good nucleophile for saturated carbon,
such as iodide or bromide, is needed for the reaction. Enol ethers, by contrast, are relatively
unstable compounds that are hydrolysed back to the carbonyl compound simply with aqueous acid—dilute HCl or H2SO4, for example.

A similar reaction occurs when enol ethers react with alcohols in acid solution and in the
absence of water, but now we are starting in the middle of the acetal hydrolysis mechanism
and going the other way, in the direction of the acetal. A useful example is the formation of
THP (tetrahydropyranyl) derivatives of alcohols from the enol ether dihydropyran. You will

Silyl enol ethers hydrolyse by a slightly different mechanism, although the fi rst step is the
same—protonation at carbon using the lone pair on oxygen. We have already seen how easy
it is to attack silicon with nucleophiles, especially those with oxygen or a halogen as the
nucleophilic atom. This tips the balance towards attack by water at silicon for the next step.

###### Reactions of silyl enol ethers with halogen and sulfur electrophiles

In comparison with other ethers, enol ethers of all kinds are rather unstable. As alkenes they
are also more reactive than normal alkenes because of the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen
atom. They react with electrophiles like bromine or chlorine on the α carbon atom, behaving
like enol derivatives and not like alkenes.
Electrophilic attack occurs at the α carbon atom and the halide ion released in this step then
attacks the silicon atom to release the product and a molecule of Me3SiX, which will be hydrolysed during the work-up.

This procedure avoids the diffi culties we outlined earlier in the direct halogenation of aldehydes and ketones. It allows the preparation of haloketones on the less substituted side of the
carbonyl group, for instance.

mechanism of this reaction,
although you should be able to
work it out without looking there!

###### Pyrans

Pyran is a six-membered oxygencontaining heterocyclic ring
system with two double bonds.
It is not aromatic although compounds like pyrones are. The
compound with only one double
bond is therefore dihydropyran,
and the saturated ring system is
tetrahydropyran.

###### To conclude

You have now seen how enols and enolates react with electrophiles based on hydrogen (deuterium), carbon, halogens, silicon, sulfur, and nitrogen. What remains to be seen is how new
carbon–carbon bonds can be formed with alkyl halides and carbonyl compounds in their
normal electrophilic mode. These reactions are the subject of Chapters 25–26, but next we
look at the ways aromatic compounds react with electrophiles. You will see similarities with
the behaviour of enols.

###### Introduction: enols and phenols

In the last chapter you saw that many ketones have a nucleophilic ‘alter ego’ known as an enol
tautomer. Formation of the enol tautomer is catalysed by acid or by base, and because the
ketone and enol are in equilibrium, enolization in the presence of D2O can lead to replacement of the protons in the α positions of ketones by deuterium atoms. This is what happens
to pentan-3-one in acidic D2O:

enol

Because the enolization and deuteration process can be repeated, eventually all of the
α-protons are replaced by deuterium.
The way this ketone is deuterated provides evidence that its enol form exists, even though
the keto/enol equilibrium greatly favours the ketone form at equilibrium. In this chapter we
shall be discussing similar reactions of a compound that exists entirely in its enol form.
That very stable enol is phenol and its stability is a consequence of the aromaticity of its
benzene ring.

The proton NMR spectrum for phenol is shown below. Before reading any further cover up
the rest of this page and make sure you can assign the spectrum.

The next spectrum is the proton NMR after shaking phenol with acidic D2O. Most of the
peaks have almost disappeared because the H atoms have been replaced with D. Only one
signal remains the same size, and even that is simplifi ed because it has lost any coupling to
adjacent protons it may have had previously.

The signal that remains is the 2H signal for the protons in the 3 and 5 positions of the aromatic ring, so the product must be the one shown in the margin. We can explain why by using
the same mechanism we used with the ketone on the previous page. Phenol is deuterated in
the same way as other enols, except that the fi nal product remains in the very stable, aromatic, enol form rather than reverting to the keto form. The fi rst step (after initial replacement of the OH with OD) is addition of D3O[+] to the enol.


This equilibrium was discussed
on p. 456.

Now this cation could lose the D from oxygen to leave a ketone (brown arrow below), or it
could lose the proton from carbon to leave the phenol (orange arrows below). Alternatively, it
could just lose the D and go back to the starting material, which is why there is an equilibrium
arrow in the scheme above.

Our spectrum tells us that three ring protons are replaced by D—the ones at the 2, 4, and 6
positions. It’s not hard to see how the same process on the other side of the OH group replaces
the proton at C-6. But how does the D at position 4 get there? The enol of phenol is conjugated, and we can push the curly arrows one stage further, like this:

The end product on treating phenol with D3O[+] has the protons in the 2, 4, and 6 positions (that is, the ortho and para positions) substituted by deuterium. D3O[+] is an electrophile, and the overall process is called electrophilic substitution. It is a reaction characteristic
of not only phenol but of other aromatic compounds, and it forms the subject of this
chapter.



- **When aromatic compounds react with electrophiles they generally do so by electrophilic**
**aromatic substitution.**


###### Benzene and its reactions with electrophiles

We’ll start with the most straightforward aromatic compound: benzene. Benzene is a planar symmetrical hexagon with six trigonal (sp[2]) carbon atoms, each having one hydrogen
atom in the plane of the ring. All the bond lengths are 1.39 Å (compare C–C 1.47 Å and
C=C 1.33 Å). All the [13]C shifts are the same (δC 128.5).



- The concept of aromaticity is
central to this chapter: we will
elaborate considerably on the
introduction to aromatic
compounds we presented in
Chapter 7.

two ways of drawing benzene the π system NMR data

The special stability of benzene (aromaticity) comes from the six π electrons in three molecular orbitals formed by the overlap of the six atomic p orbitals on the carbon atoms. The
energy levels of these orbitals are arranged so that there is exceptional stability in the molecule (a notional 140 kJ mol[−][1] over a molecule with three conjugated double bonds), and the
shift of the six identical hydrogen atoms in the NMR spectrum (δH 7.2) is evidence of a ring
current in the delocalized π system.


-----

In substituted aromatic molecules such as phenol, the C–C bond lengths in the ring are no longer exactly the same.
However, it is still all right to use either representation, depending on the purpose of the drawing. With some aromatic
compounds, such as naphthalene, it does matter which Kekulé structure you use as there is some alternation of bond
lengths. Only the fi rst Kekulé representation shows that the central bond is the strongest and shortest in the molecule
and that the C1–C2 bond is shorter than the C2–C3 bond. And if a circle in a ring indicates six π electrons, then two
circles suggests 12, even though naphthalene has only 10, making this representation less satisfactory too.

###### Electrophilic attack on benzene and on cyclohexene

Simple alkenes, including cyclohexene, react rapidly with electrophiles such as bromine or
peroxy-acids (Chapter 19). Bromine gives the product of trans addition, peracids give epoxides
by cis addition. Under the same conditions benzene reacts with neither reagent.

Benzene can, however, be persuaded to react with bromine if a Lewis acid catalyst such as
AlCl3 is added. The product contains bromine but is not from either cis or trans addition.


**Br2**

**AlCl3**

The bromine atom has replaced an atom of hydrogen, so this is a substitution reaction.

The intermediate in both reactions is a cation but the fi rst (from cyclohexene) adds an anion
while the second (from benzene) loses a proton so that the aromatic system can be restored.
Notice also that neutral bromine reacts with the alkene but the cationic AlCl3 complex is
needed to get reaction with benzene. Bromine itself is a very reactive electrophile. It is indeed
a dangerous compound and should be handled only with special precautions. Even so it does
not react with benzene. It is diffi cult to get benzene to react with anything.



- **Benzene is very unreactive**

**•** **It combines only with very reactive (usually cationic) electrophiles.**

**•** **It gives substitution and not addition products.**


###### The intermediate in electrophilic aromatic substitution is a delocalized cation

We will return again and again to this mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution during this chapter. In its most general form the mechanism has two stages: attack by an electrophile to give an intermediate cation and loss of a proton from the cation to restore the
aromaticity.

The cationic intermediate is, of course, unstable compared with the starting materials or the
product. But it is nonetheless stabilized by delocalization. The arrows below show how the
positive charge can be delocalized to the two ortho positions and to the para position, or can
be drawn as a single delocalized structure with partial (dotted) bonds and about one-third of
a positive charge (+) at three atoms.

the brown H is drawn in to emphasize the
non-aromaticity of this delocalized cation

It’s very important to note that although it is delocalized, this cation is not aromatic: there
is no cyclic array of p orbitals because the ring contains a single tetrahedral (sp[3] hybridized)
carbon atom. We have emphasized this tetrahedral atom by drawing in the hydrogen atom at
the point of substitution—the one that will be lost when aromaticity is regained. We suggest
that when you write mechanisms for electrophilic aromatic substitution you do the same.
Given this loss of aromaticity, it is not surprising that formation of the cationic intermediate
is the rate-determining step of an electrophilic aromatic substitution.

###### How do we know the cationic intermediate exists?

In strong acid, the electrophile is a proton and it is actually possible to observe this cationic intermediate. The trick is
to pick a non-nucleophilic and non-basic counterion X[−], such as SbF6–. In this octahedral anion, the central antimony
atom is surrounded by the fl uorine atoms with the negative charge spread over all seven atoms. The protonation is
carried out using FSO3H and SbF5 at –120 °C. A similar trick was described in Chapter 15 as a means to show the
existence of simple carbocations as intermediates in the SN1 mechanism.

Under these conditions it is possible to record the [1]H and [13]C NMR spectra of the cation. The shifts show that the positive charge is spread over the ring but is greatest (i.e. the electron density is least) at the ortho and para positions. Using
the data for the [1]H and [13]C NMR shifts (δH and benzene δC, respectively), a charge distribution can be calculated that
closely matches the predictions of the curly arrrows.

###### Nitration of benzene

Now we’ve introduced to you the general principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution we
need to delve into the details a little more and show you some real reactions of benzene. In
each case, a powerful cationic electrophile is needed to persuade the unreactive benzene to
act as a nucleophile.


-----

We’ll start with nitration, the introduction of a nitro (NO2) group. Nitration requires very
powerful reagents, the most typical being a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids.

**HNO3** **NO2**

**H2SO4**

Sulfuric acid is the stronger acid and it produces the powerful electrophile NO2+ by protonating the nitric acid so that a molecule of water can leave.

The nitronium ion (NO2+) is linear—it’s isoelectronic with CO2, with an sp-hybridized nitrogen atom at the centre. It’s this nitrogen that is attacked by benzene, breaking one of the N=O

**HNO3** + H2SO4.


###### Sulfonation of benzene

Benzene reacts slowly with sulfuric acid alone to give benzenesulfonic acid. One molecule of
sulfuric acid protonates another and loses a molecule of water. Notice the similarity with the
fi rst step of the nitration above.

###### Alkyl and acyl substituents can be added to a benzene ring by the Friedel–Crafts reaction

So far we have added heteroatoms only—bromine, nitrogen, or sulfur. Adding a carbon substituent to a reluctant aromatic nucleophile requires reactive carbon electrophiles and that
means carbocations. In Chapter 15 you learned that any nucleophile, however weak, will react
with a carbocation in the SN1 reaction: benzene rings are no exception. The classic SN1 electrophile is the t-butyl cation, which is generated from tert-butanol with acid.

**H**

**H**

**OH** **OH2**

This is, in fact, an unusual way to carry out such reactions. The Friedel–Crafts alkylation,
as this is known, usually involves treating benzene with a tertiary alkyl chloride and the
Lewis acid AlCl3. Rather in the manner of the reaction with bromine, AlCl3 removes the chlorine atom from t-BuCl and releases the t-Bu cation for the alkylation reaction.


Charles Friedel (1832–1899), a
French chemist, and James Crafts
(1839–1917), an American mining engineer, both studied with
Wurtz and then worked together
in Paris, where in 1877 they discovered the reaction which now
carries their names.


**AlCl3**

**Cl** **Cl**


**–HCl**


**AlCl3**


We have not usually bothered with the base that removes the proton from the intermediate.
Here it is chloride ion as the by-product is HCl, so you can see that even a very weak base will
do. Anything, such as water, chloride, or other counterions of strong acids, will do this job
well enough and you need not in general be concerned with the exact agent.
A more important variation of this reaction is the Friedel–Crafts acylation with acid chlorides and AlCl3. Aluminium chloride behaves with acyl chlorides much as it does with alkyl
chlorides—it removes chloride to leave behind a cation. In this case the cation is a linear
acylium ion, with the carbocation stabilized by the adjacent oxygen lone pair. When the acylium ion attacks the benzene ring it gives an aromatic ketone: the benzene ring has been
acylated.

-----

The acylation is better than the alkylation because it does not require any particular structural feature in the acyl chloride—R can be almost anything. In the alkylation step it is essential that the alkyl group can form a cation, otherwise the reaction does not work very well. In
addition, for reasons we are about to explore, the acylation stops cleanly after one reaction
whereas the alkylation often gives mixtures of products.



- **Friedel–Crafts reactions**

**Friedel–Crafts alkylation with t-alkyl chlorides and Lewis acids (usually AlCl3) gives t-alkyl**
**benzenes. The more reliable Friedel–Crafts acylation with acid chlorides and Lewis acids (usually**
**AlCl3) gives aryl ketones.**

###### Summary of electrophilic substitution on benzene

This completes our preliminary survey of the most important reactions in
aromatic electrophilic substitution. We shall switch our attention to the
benzene ring itself now and see what effects various types of substituent
have on these reactions. During this discussion we will return to each of
the main reactions and discuss them in more detail. Meanwhile, we conclude this introduction with an energy profi le diagram for a typical
substitution.
Since the fi rst step involves the temporary disruption of the aromatic
π system, and is therefore rate determining, it must have the higher-energy
transition state. The intermediate is unstable and has a much higher energy
than either the starting material or the products, close to that of the transition states for its formation and breakdown. The two transition states will
be similar in structure to the intermediate and we shall use the intermediate as a model for the important fi rst transition state.


reaction coordinate



- This argument is based on the Hammond postulate, which suggests that structures close
in energy that transform directly into each other are also similar in structure. For more on this,
see Chapter 39.

###### Electrophilic substitution on phenols

We started this chapter by comparing phenols with enols and now we return to phenols and
look at electrophilic substitution in full detail. You will fi nd that the reaction is much easier
than it was with benzene itself because phenols are like enols and the same reactions (bromination, nitration, sulfonation, and Friedel–Crafts reactions) occur more easily. There is a new
question too: the positions round the phenol ring are no longer equivalent—so where does
substitution take place?

###### Phenols react rapidly with bromine

Benzene does not react with bromine except with Lewis acid catalysis. Phenols react in a
very different manner: no Lewis acid is needed, the reaction occurs very rapidly, and the
product contains three atoms of bromine in specifi c positions. All that needs to be done is
to add bromine dropwise to a solution of phenol in ethanol. Initially, the yellow colour of
the bromine disappears but if, when the colour just remains, water is added, a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol is formed.

The product shows that bromination has occurred at the para position and at both ortho
positions. What a contrast to benzene! Phenol reacts three times, without catalysis, at
room temperature. Benzene reacts once, and needs a Lewis acid to make the reaction go at
all. The difference is, of course, the enol nature of phenol. The non-bonding lone pair of
electrons at oxygen contribute to a much higher-energy HOMO than the low-energy bonding electrons in a benzene ring. We should let our mechanism show this. Starting in the
_para position:_

**OH** **OH** **OH**

**+ HBr**


Why do we use numbers for
some descriptions, such as 2,4dibromophenol, but also use
ortho and para in others? The
numbers are best in naming
compounds but we need ortho
and para to describe the relationship between substituents.
Phenol brominates in both ortho
positions. In this molecule they
happen to be positions 2 and 6.
In other molecules, where the
OH group is not at C1, they will
have other numbers, but they
will still be ortho to the OH
group. Use whichever description
suits the point you are making.

_para-bromophenol_

- This mechanism should
remind you of the bromination
of enols in Chapter 20.


**Br**

**H** **Br**


Notice that we start the chain of arrows with the lone pair electrons on the OH group and
push them through the ring so that they emerge at the para position to attack the bromine
molecule. The benzene ring is acting as a conductor, allowing electrons to fl ow from the OH
group to the bromine molecule.
Now the reaction is repeated, but this time at one of the two equivalent ortho positions:

repeat

Again the lone pair electrons on the OH group are fed through the benzene ring to emerge
at the ortho position. A third bromination in the remaining ortho position—you could draw
the mechanisms for this as practice—gives the fi nal product 2,4,6-tribromophenol.


-----

If you want to put just one bromine atom into a phenol, you must work at low temperature (<5 °C) and use just one equivalent of bromine. The best solvent is the rather dangerously infl ammable carbon disulfi de (CS2), the sulfur analogue of CO2. Under these
conditions, para-bromophenol is formed in good yield as the main product (which is why
we started the mechanism for bromination of phenol in the para position). The minor product is ortho-bromophenol.

The OH group is said to be ortho, para-directing towards electrophiles. No substitution
occurs in either meta position. We can understand this by looking at the curly arrow mechanisms or by looking at the molecular orbitals. In Chapter 20 (p. 453) we looked at the π system
of an enolate and saw how the electron density is located mainly on the end atoms (the oxygen and the carbon). In phenol it is the ortho and para positions that are electron-rich (and, of
course, the oxygen itself). We can show this using curly arrows.

**OH** **OH** **OH** **OH**

The curly arrows actually give an indication of the electron distribution in the HOMO of
the molecule. The reason is that the HOMO has large coeffi cients at alternate atoms, just as the
allyl anion had large coeffi cients at its ends but not in the middle (Chapter 7).

###### NMR can give us some confi rmation of the electron distribution

The [1]H NMR shifts of phenol give us an indication of the electron distribution in the π system.
The more electron density that surrounds a nucleus, the more shielded it is and so the smaller
the shift (see Chapter 13). All the chemical shifts for the ring protons in phenol are smaller
than those for benzene (7.26 ppm), which means that overall there is greater electron density
in the ring. There is little difference between the ortho and the para positions: these are where
the electron density is greatest and hence these are the sites for electrophilic attack. The
chemical shift at the meta positions is not signifi cantly different from those in benzene—this
is where the electron density is lowest.


###### Oxygen substituents activate a benzene ring

To brominate phenol, all we had to do was to mix bromine and phenol—if we do this with
benzene itself, nothing happens. We therefore say that, relative to benzene, the OH group in
phenol activates the ring towards electrophilic attack. The OH group is both activating and
_ortho, para-directing. Other groups that can donate electrons also activate and direct ortho,_
_para. Anisole (methoxybenzene) is the ‘enol ether’ equivalent of phenol. It reacts faster than_
benzene with electrophiles.



- **Electrophilic attack on phenols**

**OH groups on benzene rings are ortho, para-directing and activating.**

**You will get the right product if you start your arrows at a lone pair on the OH group.**


-----

Nitration of phenol is also very fast and can be problematic under the usual nitration conditions (conc. HNO3, conc. H2SO4) because concentrated nitric acid oxidizes phenols. The solution is to use dilute nitric acid. The concentration of NO2+ will be small but that does not
matter with such a reactive benzene ring.

The product is a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrophenol from which the ortho compound
can be separated by steam distillation. A strong intramolecular hydrogen bond reduces the
availability of the OH group for intermolecular hydrogen bonding so the ortho compound has
a lower boiling point.

The phenoxide ion is even more reactive towards electrophilic attack than phenol. It manages to react with such weak electrophiles as carbon dioxide. This reaction, known as the

###### A nitrogen lone pair activates even more strongly

Aniline (phenylamine) is even more reactive towards electrophiles than phenols, phenyl
ethers, or phenoxide ions. Because nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen, the lone pair
is higher in energy and so even more available to interact with the π system than is the lone
pair on oxygen. Reaction of aniline with bromine is very vigorous and rapidly gives 2,4,6-tribromoaniline. The mechanism is very similar to the bromination of phenol so we show only
one ortho substitution to remind you of how it goes.

###### Making aromatic amines less reactive

The high reactivity of aniline can actually be a problem. Suppose we wanted to put just one
bromine atom onto the ring. With phenol, this is possible (p. 480)—if bromine is added slowly
to a solution of phenol in carbon disulfi de solution and the temperature is kept below 5 °C,
the main product is para-bromophenol. Not so if aniline is used—the main product is the
triply substituted product.

How then could we prevent oversubstitution from occurring? What we need is a way to
make aniline less reactive by preventing the nitrogen lone pair from interacting so strongly
with the π system of the ring. Fortunately, it is very simple to do this. In Chapter 8 (p. 175) we
saw how the nitrogen atom in an amide is much less basic than a normal amine because it is
conjugated with the carbonyl group. This is the strategy that we will use here—simply acylate
the amine to form an amide. The lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom of the amide are
conjugated with the carbonyl group as usual but their delocalization into the benzene ring is
weaker than in the amine. The amide nitrogen donates less electron density into the ring, so
the electrophilic aromatic substitution is more controlled. The lone pair is still there, but its
power is tamed. Reaction still occurs in the ortho and para positions (mainly para) but it occurs
once only.

###### Selectivity between ortho and para positions

Phenols and anilines react in the ortho and/or para positions for electronic reasons. These are
the most important effects in deciding where an electrophilic substitution will occur on
a benzene ring. When it comes to choosing between _ortho and_ _para positions we need to_
consider steric effects as well. You will have noticed that we have seen one ortho selective
reaction—the formation of salicylic acid from phenol—and several para selective reactions
such as the bromination of an amide just discussed.
If the reactions occurred merely statistically, we should expect twice as much ortho as para
product because there are two ortho positions. However, we should also expect more steric
hindrance in _ortho substitution since the new substituent must sit closely beside the one_
already there. With large substituents, such as the amide, steric hindrance will be signifi cant
and it is not surprising that we get more para product.
There is another effect that decreases the amount of ortho substitution, and that is the induc_tive electron-withdrawing effect of an electronegative substituent. As you’ve seen, oxygen and_
nitrogen, although they are electronegative, activate the ring towards attack by donating
π electron density from their lone pairs. At the same time, the C–O or C–N σ bond is polarized back towards the O or N atom—in other words, they _donate electron density to the_
π system but withdraw electron density from the σ framework. This is inductive electron withdrawal—it affects the atoms nearest the O or N atom the most, and has the effect of decreasing
the likelihood that attack will happen in the ortho positions.

Toluene reacts 4000 times faster than benzene (this may sound like a lot, but the rate constant for N,N-dimethylaniline is 10[14] times greater), and the electrophile attacks mostly the
_ortho and para positions. These two observations together suggest that the methyl groups may_
be increasing the electron density in the π system of the benzene ring, specifi cally in the ortho
and para positions, rather like a weaker version of an OR group. The [1]H NMR chemical shifts
for toluene (see margin) do suggest that there is slightly more electron density in the para position than in the meta positions. All the shifts are smaller than those of benzene (but not by
much) and the shielding is much less than it is in phenols or anilines.
The methyl group donates electrons weakly by conjugation. In phenol, a lone pair on oxygen is conjugated with the π system. In toluene there is no lone pair but one of the C–H σ
bonds can still interact with the π system in a similar way. This interaction is known as σ
**conjugation. Just as the conjugation of the oxygen lone pair increases the electron density at**
the ortho and para positions, so too does σ conjugation, but far less so.
σ conjugation also means toluene’s π electrons—its HOMO—become slightly higher in
energy than those of benzene. It is best to regard alkyl benzenes as rather reactive benzenes,
and to draw mechanisms using their π electrons as the nucleophile, like this:

Electrophilic attack occurs on alkyl benzenes so that the positive charge ends up on the
carbon bearing the alkyl group. This carbon is tertiary, making the cation there more stable.
This condition is fulfi lled if toluene is attacked at the ortho position, as shown above, but also
at the para position, because in both cases the positive charge is delocalized onto the same
three carbons atoms.

If, on the other hand, the electrophile were to attack at the meta position, the charge would

the alkyl group is possible. The situation is no worse than that of benzene, but given that toluene reacts some 10[3] times faster than benzene at the ortho and para positions these reactions
win out. Nonetheless, unlike phenol, toluene does give trace amounts of _meta-substituted_
products.

way (p. 215) with PCl5. It can also be made directly from toluene by sulfonation with chlorosulfonic acid ClSO2OH. This reaction favours the ortho sulfonyl chloride, which is isolated by

- The preference for para

chlorosulfonation is the fi rst hint
that sulfonation is reversible.
This point is discussed, and
exploited, in Chapter 24
(p. 566).


In drawing the mechanism we can again get the positive charge onto the tertiary ipso atom.
No treatment with NaCl is needed in this reaction as the major product (the ortho acid chloride) is isolated by distillation.


It is fortunate that the ortho acid chloride is the major product in the chlorosulfonation
because it is needed in the synthesis of saccharin, the fi rst of the non-fattening sweeteners.
The formation of the sulfonamide is like that of an ordinary amide, but the oxidation
of the methyl group with potassium permanganate is probably new to you. It’s a rather

###### Electron-withdrawing substituents give meta products

So far, all of the substituted benzene rings we have considered have carried substituents capable of donating electron density to the ring: despite being electronegative atoms, oxygen and
nitrogen have lone pairs which conjugate with the ring’s π system; a similar but weaker effect
results from σ conjugation from a methyl group. Two consequences arise from these substituents: the ring becomes more reactive than benzene, and substitution takes place in the ortho
and para positions.
So what happens with groups which pull electron density away from the ring? Such a group
is the trimethylammonium substituent: the nitrogen is electronegative but unlike in aniline
this electronegativity is not offset by donation of a lone pair—the nitrogen is tetrahedral and
no longer has one to donate. Nitration of the phenyltrimethyl ammonium ion yields mainly

slowly than that of benzene.

If, on the other hand, the electrophile were to attack the ortho or para position (the hypothetical reaction para to CF3 is shown below) then the carbon next to CF3 would have to carry
a positive charge, which would be destabilized by the electron withdrawal, making this a
high-energy intermediate.

Think of it this way: the electron-defi cient ring would really rather not react with an electrophile (hence the slower rate) but if it has to (because the electrophile is so reactive) then it takes
the least bad course of keeping the positive charge away from the electron-withdrawing
groups—and that means meta substitution.

###### Some substituents withdraw electrons by conjugation

Aromatic nitration is important because it is a convenient way of adding a nitrogen substituent to the ring and because it stops cleanly after one nitro group has been added.
Double nitration of benzene is possible but stronger conditions must be used—fuming
nitric acid instead of normal concentrated nitric acid—and the mixture must be refl uxed at
around 100 °C.

The second nitro group is introduced meta to the fi rst: evidently the nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing.
The nitro group is conjugated with the π system of the benzene ring and is strongly electron
_withdrawing—and it withdraws electrons specifi cally from the ortho and para positions. We_
can use curly arrows to show this:

**O** **O** **O** **O**

**N** **N** **N** **N**

**O** **O** **O** **O**

The nitro group withdraws electron density from the π system of the ring thereby making
the ring less reactive towards an electrophile. Since more electron density is removed from the
_ortho and para positions, the least electron-defi cient position is the meta position. Hence the_
nitro group is meta directing. In the nitration of benzene, it is much harder to nitrate a second
time and, if we insist, the second nitro group goes in meta to the fi rst.
Other reactions go the same way: bromination of nitrobenzene gives _meta-bromonitro-_
benzene in good yield. The combination of bromine and iron powder provides the necessary
Lewis acid catalyst (FeBr3) while the high temperature needed for this unfavourable reaction
is easily achieved as the boiling point of nitrobenzene is over 200 °C.

Points to note:

 - Each of the compounds contains the unit Ph–X=Y, where Y is an electronegative
element, usually oxygen.

 - In each compound, all the protons have larger chemical shifts than benzene because
the electron density at carbon is less.

 - The protons in the meta position have the smallest shift and so the greatest electron
density.

Nitro is the most electron-withdrawing of these groups and some of the other compounds
are nearly as reactive (in the meta position, of course) as benzene itself. It is easy, for example,
to nitrate methyl benzoate and the m-nitro ester can then be hydrolysed to meta-nitrobenzoic
acid very easily.

One group of substituents remains and they are slightly odd. They are ortho, para-directing
but they are also deactivating. They are the halogens.

###### Halogens show evidence of both electron withdrawal and donation

So far we have steered clear of the reactions of halogenated derivatives of benzene. Before we
explain their reactions, have a look at the table, which shows the rates of nitration of fl uoro,
chloro, bromo, and iodobenzene relative to benzene itself, and also gives an indication of the
products formed in each case.

We’ll come back to this table a few times in the next page or so, but the fi rst thing to note is
that all the halobenzenes react more slowly than benzene itself. Evidently, electron withdrawal by the electronegative halogen deactivates the ring towards attack. But the second
thing that should strike you is that, unlike the deactivating groups we have just been discussing, halogens are **ortho, paradirecting—very few meta-nitrated products are formed.**
The only way this makes sense is if there are two opposing effects: electron donation by
conjugation and electron withdrawal by induction. The halogen has three lone pairs, one of
which may conjugate with the ring just like in phenol or aniline. Yet the conjugation is much
less good than in phenol or aniline, for one of two reasons. When Cl, Br, or I is the substituent,
the problem is size: the 2p orbitals from the carbon atoms overlap poorly with the bigger
p orbitals from the halogen (3p for chlorine, 4p for bromine, and 5p for iodine). This size
mismatch is clearly illustrated by comparing the reactivities of aniline and chlorobenzene:


-----

**F** **F**

**Br2**
**FeBr3**

**–20 °C**

95% **Br**

We mentioned inductive
effects as a factor controlling ortho
vs para reactivity on p. 483.


chlorine and nitrogen have approximately the same electronegativity, but aniline is much
more reactive than chlorobenzene because of the better overlap between the carbon and
nitrogen 2p orbitals. Fluorine 2p orbitals are the right size to overlap well with the carbon 2p
orbitals, but now there is another problem: the orbitals of fl uorine are much lower in energy
than the orbitals of carbon since fl uorine is so electronegative.
So, all four halogens are less good at donating electrons to the ring than an OH or NH2
group, but not only are the halobenzenes less reactive than phenol or aniline, they are even
less reactive than benzene itself. Now, when we looked at aniline and phenol, we didn’t
worry about any electron withdrawal by induction, even though both oxygen and nitrogen
are of course rather electronegative. Electron donation from their N and O lone pairs is
evidently much more important. But with the conjugation in the halobenzenes already
weak, inductive electron withdrawal takes over as the dominant factor in determining
reactivity.
With all this in mind, how would you expect fl uorobenzene to react? Most electron density
is removed fi rst from the ortho positions by induction, then from the meta positions, and then
from the para position. Any conjugation of the lone pairs on fl uorine with the π system would
increase the electron density in the ortho and para positions. Both effects favour the para position and this is where most substitution occurs. But is the ring more or less reactive than benzene? This is hard to say and the honest answer is that sometimes fl uorobenzene is
more reactive in the _para position than benzene (for example, in proton exchange and in_
acetylation—see later) and sometimes it is less reactive than benzene (for example, in nitration,
as shown by the table above). In all cases, fl uorobenzene is signifi cantly more reactive than the
other halobenzenes. We appreciate that this is a rather surprising conclusion, but the evidence
supports it. For example, fl uorobenzene reacts with bromine and an iron catalyst (it does need
a catalyst: it is not as reactive as phenol) at only –20 °C to give the para-bromo derivative.
Let’s now look back in bit more detail at the table above. We can now also explain two other
features of the results:

 - The percentage of the ortho product increases from fl uorobenzene to iodobenzene.
We might have expected the amount to decrease as the size of the halide increases
because of increased steric hindrance at the ortho position but this is clearly not the
case. Instead the greater inductive effect of the more electronegative atoms (F, Cl)
withdraws electron density mostly from the ortho positions, lessening their
reactivity.

 - The rates of the reactions fall into two pairs and follow a ‘U-shaped’ sequence:
fl uorobenzene nitrates most quickly, followed closely by iodobenzene; chloro-, and
bromobenzene nitrate at around half these rates. Chlorine and bromine suffer because
both are quite electronegative and neither has good lone pair overlap: in fl uorine,
overlap is good; in iodine, electronegativity is much less.

In practical terms, it is usually possible to get high yields of para products from electrophilic
substitution reactions of halobenzenes. Both nitration and sulfonation of bromobenzene give
enough material to make the synthesis worthwhile. Although mixtures of products are always
bad in a synthesis, electrophilic aromatic substitution is usually simple to carry out on a large
enough scale to make separation of the major product, ideally by crystallization, a workable
method. A 68% yield of sodium p-bromobenzenesulfonate can be achieved by recrystallization of the sodium salt from water and a 70% yield of p-bromonitrobenzene by separation
from the ortho isomer by recrystallization from EtOH.

###### Two or more substituents may cooperate or compete

The directing effects of two or more substituents can work with or against one another.
Bromoxynil and ioxynil are contact herbicides especially used in spring cereals to control weeds resistant to other weedkillers, and both are synthesized from _p-hydroxybenz-_
aldehyde by double halogenation. The aldehyde directs meta and the OH group directs
_ortho: both effects work together to promote bromination or iodination at the same two_
positions.

In other cases substituents compete by directing to different positions. The antioxidant
BHT (p. 58) is made from 4-methylphenol (known as p-cresol) by a Friedel–Crafts alkylation.
Usually, both the methyl and OH groups are ortho, para directors. The para positions are obviously both blocked, but the positions ortho to each of the groups are different. Since the –OH
group is much more powerfully directing than the methyl group it ‘wins’ and directs the
electrophile (a t-butyl cation) ortho to itself.



- The reaction with NH2OH is
the formation of an oxime from
the aldehyde and hydroxylamine
and was dealt with in
Chapter 11. The reaction with
P2O5 is a dehydration—
phosphorus is used to form the
nitrile by removing water from
the oxime.

In this case the t-butyl cation is made from the alkene and protic acid; alternative reagents
would be t-butanol with protic acid or t-butyl chloride with AlCl3.
Even a ‘watered-down’ activating group like the amide –NHCOMe, which provides an extra
pair of electrons, will ‘win’ over a deactivating group or an activating alkyl group. Bromination
of this amide goes ortho to the –NHCOMe group but meta to the methyl group.

When looking at any compound where competition is an issue it is sensible to consider
electronic effects fi rst and then steric effects. For electronic effects, in general, any activating
effects are more important than deactivating ones. For example, the aldehyde below has three
groups—two methoxy groups that direct ortho and para and an aldehyde that directs meta.

- If you are in a bar and
someone picks a fi ght with you,
it is no help that an inoffensive
little man in the corner would
prefer not to pick a fi ght.
Aggressive –NR2 and –OR
groups are not much affected
by inoffensive –Br or carbonyl
groups in another corner of the
molecule.


Despite the fact that the aldehyde group withdraws electron density from positions 2 and 6,
C6 is still the position for nitration. The activating methoxy groups dominate electronically
and the choice is really between C2, C5, and C6. Now consider steric factors: reaction at C2 or
C5 would lead to three adjacent substituents. Substitution occurs at position 6.

###### Some problems and some opportunities

You’ve seen plenty of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions in this chapter that are
reliable and widely used—bromination and nitration, for example. But others pose
problems:

 - Friedel–Crafts alkylation works only when the intermediate cation is stable, so how
do we add an n-alkyl chain to an aromatic ring?

 - There is no good way of introducing an oxygen electrophile to an aromatic ring, so
how do we make Ar–O bonds?

 - Electron-donating groups always direct ortho, para, so how do we put in a group meta
to, for example, an amino group?

We will consider some answers to these questions in this last section of this chapter.

###### A closer look at Friedel–Crafts chemistry

Reactions such as nitration and sulfonation add a very deactivating substituent. They usually
stop cleanly after a single substitution unless there is also a strongly activating substituent.
Even then it may be possible to stop after a single substitution. Weakly electron-withdrawing
substituents like the halogens can be added once, but multiple substitution is common when
the starting arene carries strongly activating substituents like OH and NH2.

###### Two reasons to avoid a Friedel–Crafts alkylation

When electron-donating substituents are added, multiple substitution is always a threat. The
principal reaction where multiple substitution is a genuine problem is the Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction. Here’s an example: preparation of diphenylmethane from benzene and benzyl
chloride is a useful reaction but the product has two benzene rings, each more reactive than
benzene itself. A 50% yield is the best we can do and that requires a large excess of benzene to
ensure that it competes successfully for the reagent with the reactive, electron-rich product.

Multiple substitution is just one of the potential pitfalls of Friedel–Crafts alkylations. The
other is important to be aware of too: Friedel–Crafts alkylations work well only with stable

So where does the major product of the reaction come from? The three carbons are arranged
not as an n-propyl group but as an iso-propyl group: a rearrangement has occurred. This is the
mechanism:

The green hydrogen migrates to allow a secondary rather than a primary alkyl cation to be
formed, and iso-propylbenzene results. This leaves us with a problem: how can you add primary alkyl groups to benzene rings?

###### The solution: use Friedel–Crafts acylation instead

We can kill two birds with one stone here: both problems common to the Friedel–Crafts
alkylation are solved when the acylation is used instead. Firstly, the product of the acylation
is a ketone: the reaction introduces a deactivating, electron-withdrawing, conjugating carbonyl group to the ring, so the product is less reactive than the starting material. Reaction will
stop cleanly after one acylation. Here’s benzene reacting with propionyl chloride.

The reduction of a Friedel–Crafts acylation product like this always gives an n-alkylbenzene, exactly the sort of compound that causes the problems in Friedel–Crafts alkylation.
Friedel–Crafts acylations also work well when anhydrides are used in the place of acid chlorides. The acylium ion is formed in the same way:

- Notice how much AlCl3 is

alkylations using an alkyl

in catalytic quantities. In an
acylation, however, the Lewis
acid can also complex to any
oxygen atoms present, to the
carbonyl in the product, for
example. As a result, in
acylation reactions more Lewis
acid is required—just over one
equivalent per carbonyl group.

Reduction of the ketone can give a simpler carboxylic acid, but we can go one step further
and do another acylation—because the reaction is intramolecular, it goes even with just a
strong acid (phosphoric acid): the strong acid makes the OH into a good leaving group (water)

- **The advantages of acylation over alkylation**

**Two problems in Friedel–Crafts alkylation do not arise with acylation.**

**•** **The acyl group in the product withdraws electrons from the π system, making multiple**
**substitutions harder. Indeed, if the ring is too deactivated to start off with, Friedel–Crafts**
**acylation may not be possible at all—nitrobenzene is inert to Friedel–Crafts acylation and**
**is often used as a solvent for these reactions.**

**•** **Rearrangements are also no longer a problem because the electrophile, the acylium cation,**
**is already relatively stable.**

**•** **The acyl groups of the products can be reduced to primary alkyl groups, which are**
**impossible to introduce cleanly by Friedel–Crafts alkylation.**


###### Exploiting the chemistry of the nitro group

The nitro group is remarkably useful in a number of ways:

 - It is easy to introduce by nitration chemistry (p. 476).

 - Unlike most N- or O-based functional groups, it is a meta director (p. 488).

 - It can be reduced to an amino group.

 - It can be replaced with other substituents using diazonium chemistry.


-----

You have met the fi rst two of these features, but the last two may be new to you. An aromatic
nitro group is easy to turn into an amino group—a number of reagents will do this, but the
most common are tin in dilute HCl or hydrogenation with a palladium catalyst supported on
charcoal (written as Pd/C).

**NO2** **H2, Pd/C** **NH2**

**or Sn,**
**dil. HCl**

This simple transformation is extremely important because it turns the meta-directing nitro
group into an ortho, para-directing amino group (although as you saw on p. 483, the amino
group may need ‘taming’ to make its reactivity useful). The sequence of nitration–reduction
allows us to introduce a useful NH2+ equivalent into an aromatic molecule, and can let us make
otherwise diffi cult-to-form meta-substituted amino compounds.

The reduction to an amino group also opens up the possibility of replacing the nitrogen
substituent completely, by converting it fi rst to a diazonium group. Treatment of an amine
with nitrous acid converts it to an unstable diazonium salt, whose mechanism of formation
and chemistry we will discuss in the next chapter. Not surprisingly, diazonium salts very readily lose nitrogen gas, and this substitution of N2 by a nucleophile opens yet more opportunities
to compounds derived from nitrobenzene derivatives. It also involves nucleophilic substitution
at the aromatic ring, which forms the subject of the next chapter.

###### Alkenes conjugated with carbonyl groups

To start this chapter, let us take you back to one of the fi rst reactions we introduced: nucleophilic addition to carbonyl groups. Here are two examples, both of which give products
which you should fully expect. We’ve included details of the IR spectra of the products to
confi rm fi rstly that the product has no carbonyl group and secondly that the alkene is still
there.

spectroscopy, turn back to
Chapter 3. Any C=O peak
would appear near 1700 cm[−1],
but there isn’t one. Instead
there’s an O–H peak at
3600 cm[−1]. The 2250 cm[−1] peak
is C≡N; C=C is at 1650 cm[−1].


Now let’s tweak the conditions: we repeat the fi rst reaction at a higher temperature, and we
add to the second a small amount of a copper salt. Now the products are different:

Both products A and B have kept their carbonyl group (IR peak at 1710–1715 cm[−][1]) but have
lost the C=C. Yet A, at least, is unquestionably an addition product because it contains a C≡N
peak at 2250 cm[−][1].
Well, the identities of A and B are revealed here: they are the products of addition, not to the
carbonyl group, but to the C=C bond. Here’s a mechanism, for both reactions of cyanide:
fi rstly the direct addition to C=O and secondly addition to the C=C bond.

This type of reaction, where a nucleophile adds to a C=C double bond, is called conjugate
**addition, and this chapter is about the sorts of alkenes (and arenes) that do this kind of thing.**
We will also explain how such small differences in reaction conditions (temperature, or the
presence of CuCl) manage to change the outcome so dramatically.
But fi rst we need to place these conjugate additions into context. As you found out in
Chapter 19, alkenes are nucleophilic. Almost regardless of their substituents, they react with
electrophiles such as bromine to form adducts in which the π bond of the alkene has been
replaced by two σ bonds.

But as we have just seen, this last type of alkene also reacts with nucleophiles (such as cyanide,
Grignard reagents, and, as you see below, more besides), and we now need to consider why.

###### Conjugated alkenes can be electrophilic

Conjugate additions occur only when the C=C double bond is immediately adjacent to the
C=O group. They don’t occur to C=C bonds that aren’t conjugated (see the box on p. 501 for
an illustration of this).
Compounds with double bonds adjacent to a C=O group are known as α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl compounds. Many α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds have trivial names, and
some are shown here. Some classes of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds also have names
such as ‘enone’, made up of ‘ene’ (for the double bond) + ‘one’ (for ketone).

Most types of nucleophiles can be made to undergo conjugate additions with α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl compounds, and seven examples are shown below. Note that many of these nucleophiles would not add to a simple carbonyl group: we will explain why shortly. Conjugate addition is also known as Michael addition, and the reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds
shown here are often known as Michael acceptors.

The reason that α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds react differently is conjugation, the
phenomenon we discussed in Chapter 7. There we introduced you to the idea that bringing
two π systems (two C=C bonds, for example, or a C=C bond and a C=O bond) close together
leads to a stabilizing interaction. It also leads to modifi ed reactivity, because the π bonds no
longer react as independent functional groups but as a single, conjugated system.


-----

###### Alkenes conjugated with carbonyl groups become polarized

To show why alkenes conjugated with carbonyl groups behave differently from unconjugated
alkenes, we use curly arrows to indicate delocalization of the π electrons over the four atoms
in the conjugated system. Both representations are extremes, and the true structure lies somewhere in between, but the polarized structure indicates why the conjugated C=C bond is
electrophilic and why the β carbon is attacked by nucleophiles.

**O** **O**


**Me**


β **Me** β

###### Polarization is detectable spectroscopically

IR spectroscopy provides us with evidence for polarization in C=C bonds conjugated to
C=O bonds. An unconjugated ketone C=O absorbs at 1715 cm[−][1] while an unconjugated
alkene C=C absorbs (usually rather weakly) at about 1650 cm[−][1]. Bringing these two groups
into conjugation in an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound leads to two peaks at 1675 and
1615 cm[−][1], respectively, both quite intense. The lowering of the frequency of both peaks is
consistent with a weakening of both π bonds (notice that the polarized structure has only
single bonds where the C=O and C=C double bonds were). The increase in the intensity of
the C=C absorption is consistent with polarization brought about by conjugation with
C=O: a conjugated C=C bond has a signifi cantly larger dipole moment than its unconjugated cousins.
The polarization of the C=C bond is also evident in the [13]C NMR spectrum, with the signal
for the sp[2] carbon atom furthest from the carbonyl group moving downfi eld relative to an
unconjugated alkene to about 140 ppm, and the signal for the other double bond carbon atom
staying at about 120 ppm.

###### Molecular orbitals control conjugate additions

We have spectroscopic evidence that a conjugated C=C bond is polarized, and we can explain
this with curly arrows, but the actual bond-forming step must involve movement of electrons
from the HOMO of the nucleophile to the LUMO of the unsaturated carbonyl compound.
This example is an effi cient (the reaction happens even at 0 °C) addition to acrolein (propenal) with methoxide as the nucleophile.

- In acrolein, the HOMO is in
fact not the highest fi lled π
orbital you see here, but the
lone pairs on oxygen. This is not
important, however, because
here we are considering acrolein
as an electrophile, so we are
interested only in its LUMO.


But what does this LUMO look like? It will certainly be more complicated than the π* LUMO
of a simple carbonyl group. The nearest thing you have met so far (in Chapter 7) are the orbitals of butadiene (C=C conjugated with C=C), which we can compare with the α,β-unsaturated
aldehyde acrolein (C=C conjugated with C=O). The orbitals in the π systems of butadiene and
acrolein are shown here. They are different because acrolein’s orbitals are perturbed (distorted) by the oxygen atom (Chapter 4). You need not be concerned with exactly how the sizes
of the orbitals are worked out, but for the moment just concentrate on the shape of the LUMO,
the orbital that will accept electrons when a nucleophile attacks.

In the LUMO, the largest coeffi cient is on the β carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system, shown

just seen, the HOMO is the methoxide oxygen’s lone pair, so this will be the key orbital interaction that gives rise to the new bond.

The second largest coeffi cient is on the C=O carbon atom, so it’s not surprising that some
nucleophiles attack here as well—remember the example right at the beginning of the chapter
where you saw cyanide attacking either the double bond or the carbonyl group depending on
the conditions of the reaction. We shall next look at some conjugate additions with alcohols
and amines as nucleophiles, before reconsidering the question of where the nucleophile attacks.


-----

###### Conjugate additions have enolates or enols as intermediates

So much for the addition step of the reaction. But the product of this step is of course not the
fi nal product of the reaction—it is in fact an enolate. We hope you recognize these species
from Chapter 20, where you saw them being made by treating carbonyl compounds with
base. Conjugate addition is another way of generating an enolate, and as with all enolates,
protonation gives back a carbonyl compound. The proton has to come from somewhere, so
conjugate additions are usually done in protic solvents (such as alcohols or water). Here is
another example with an alcohol as the nucleophile:


**O**


**O**

In alkaline solution, a small amount of alkoxide is produced (the pKa of an alcohol is slightly
higher than that of water), which attacks the C=C double bond in a conjugate addition. The
product is an enolate, which is protonated by water to give the fi nal aldehyde, and regenerates
hydroxide as it does so: only a catalytic amount of base is required for this type of reaction.

If you survey the initial overview of conjugate additions on p. 500 you will see that several
take place under acidic conditions. Treatment of this α,β-unsaturated ketone with HCl, for
example, gives a chloroketone. The fi rst step must be protonation of the carbonyl group, which
makes the enone even more electrophilic by giving it a positive charge. Chloride attacks the β
carbon to give an enol.

###### Conjugate addition or direct addition to the carbonyl group?

We have shown you several examples of conjugate additions using various nucleophiles and
α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, but we haven’t yet addressed one important question.
When do nucleophiles do conjugate addition (also called 1,4-addition) and when do they add
directly to the carbonyl group (1,2-addition)? Several factors are involved—they are summarized here, and we will spend the next section of this chapter discussing them in turn.

**The way that nucleophiles react depends on:**

###### Reaction conditions

The very fi rst conjugate addition reaction in this chapter depended on the conditions of the
reaction. Treating an enone with cyanide and an acid catalyst at low temperature gives a
cyanohydrin by direct attack at C=O, while heating the reaction mixture leads to conjugate
addition. What is going on?

cyanohydrin conjugate addition
(direct addition to carbonyl) product

We’ll consider the low-temperature reaction fi rst. As you know from Chapter 6, it is quite
normal for cyanide to react with a ketone under these conditions to form a cyanohydrin. You
also know from Chapter 6 that cyanohydrin formation is reversible. Even if the equilibrium
for cyanohydrin formation lies well over to the side of the products, there will always be a
small amount of starting enone remaining. Most of the time, this enone will react to form
more cyanohydrin and, as it does, some cyanohydrin will decompose back to enone plus
cyanide—such is the nature of a dynamic equilibrium. But every now and then—at a much
slower rate—the starting enone will undergo a conjugate addition with the cyanide.

conjugate addition product irreversible reversible cyanohydrin


thermodynamic product: kinetic product:
more stable forms faster


-----

Now we have a different situation: conjugate addition is essentially an irreversible reaction,
so once a molecule of enone has been converted to conjugate addition product, its fate is
sealed: it cannot go back to enone again. Very slowly, therefore, the amount of conjugate addition product in the mixture will build up. In order for the enone–cyanohydrin equilibrium to
be maintained, any enone that is converted to conjugate addition product will have to be
replaced by reversion of cyanohydrin to enone plus cyanide. Even at room temperature, we
can therefore expect the cyanohydrin to be converted bit by bit to conjugate addition product. This may take a very long time, but reaction rates are faster at higher temperatures, so at
80 °C this process does not take long at all and, after a few hours, the cyanohydrin has all been
converted to conjugate addition product.
The contrast between the two products is this: the cyanohydrin is formed faster than the
conjugate addition product, and is known as the product of kinetic control (or the kinetic
product), but the conjugate addition product is the more stable compound and is the product
of thermodynamic control (or the thermodynamic product). Typically, kinetic control involves
lower temperatures and shorter reaction times, which ensures that only the fastest reaction has
the chance to occur. And, typically, thermodynamic control involves higher temperatures and
long reaction times to ensure that even the slower reactions have a chance to occur, and all the
material is converted to the more stable compound.



- **Kinetic and thermodynamic control**

**•** **The product that forms faster is called the kinetic product.**

**•** **The product that is the more stable is called the thermodynamic product.**

**Similarly,**

**•** **Conditions that give rise to the kinetic product are called kinetic control.**

**•** **Conditions that give rise to the thermodynamic product are called thermodynamic control.**


Why is direct addition faster than conjugate addition? Well, although the carbon atom β to
the C=O group carries some positive charge, the carbon atom of the carbonyl group carries
more, and so electrostatic attraction for the charged nucleophiles will encourage it to attack
the carbonyl group directly rather than undergo conjugate addition.
And why is the conjugate addition product the more stable? In the conjugate addition product, we gain a C–C σ bond, losing a C=C π bond, but keeping the C=O π bond. With direct
addition, we still gain a C–C bond, but we lose the C=O π bond and keep the C=C π bond. C=O
π bonds are stronger than C=C π bonds, so the conjugate addition product is more stable.
Practically, then, to get conjugate addition to occur you just have to give the reaction plenty
of energy and maybe plenty of time to fi nd its way to the most stable product. Here’s an example: note the temperature!

###### Structural factors

So far we have shown you conjugate additions mainly of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and
unsaturated α,β-ketones. You won’t be at all surprised to learn, however, that unsaturated
acids, esters, amides, and nitriles—in fact all carboxylic acid derivatives—can also take part
in conjugate addition reactions. Two examples, an amide and an ester, are shown on the right
below. But notice how the selectivity of these reactions depends on the structure of the unsaturated compound: compare the way butyllithium adds to this α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and
α,β-unsaturated amide. Both additions are irreversible, and BuLi attacks the reactive carbonyl
group of the aldehyde, but prefers conjugate addition to the less reactive amide. Similarly,
ammonia reacts with this acyl chloride to give an amide product that derives from direct

In both of these cases, the site of nucleophilic attack is determined simply by reactivity: the
more reactive the carbonyl group, the more direct addition to C=O will result. The most reactive carbonyl groups, as you saw in Chapter 10, are those that are not conjugated with O or N
(as they are in esters and amides), and particularly reactive are acyl chlorides and aldehydes.
In general, the proportion of direct addition to the carbonyl group follows the reactivity
sequence in the margin.
Sodium borohydride is a nucleophile that you have seen reducing simple aldehydes and
ketones to alcohols, but it will also do conjugate addition reactions. Which of the alternatives
actually takes place depends on the reactivity of the C=O group. NaBH4 usually reacts with
α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to give alcohols by direct addition to the carbonyl group.

It is possible to force NaBH4 to

The borohydride has reduced not only the carbonyl group but the double bond as well. In
fact, it’s the double bond that’s reduced fi rst in a conjugate addition, followed by addition to
the carbonyl group.

###### The nature of the nucleophile: hard or soft

Among the best nucleophiles of all at doing conjugate addition are thiols, the sulfur analogues
of alcohols. In this example, the nucleophile is thiophenol (phenol with the O replaced by S).

a thiol thiophenol


So what’s so special about a thiol? As you’ve seen already, attraction between nucleophiles
and electrophiles is governed by two related interactions—electrostatic attraction between
positive and negative charges and orbital overlap between the HOMO of the nucleophile and
the LUMO of the electrophile. Successful reactions usually result from a combination of both,
but sometimes reactivity can be dominated by one or the other. The dominant factor, be it
electrostatic or orbital control, depends on the nucleophile and electrophile involved.
Nucleophiles containing small, electronegative atoms (such as O or Cl), which we call ‘hard’,
tend to react under predominantly electrostatic control, while ‘soft’ nuclophiles containing
larger atoms (including the sulfur of thiols, but also P, I, and Se) are predominantly subject to
control by orbital overlap.
The table below divides some nucleophiles into the two categories (plus some that lie in
between)—but don’t try to learn it! Rather, convince yourself that the properties of each one
justify its location in the table. Most of these nucleophiles you have not yet seen in action, and
the most important ones at this stage are indicated in bold type.

**Hard and soft nucleophiles**

**Hard nucleophiles** **Borderline** **Soft nucleophiles**

**H2O, ROH, ROR′, RCOR’** **RNH2, R[1]R[2]NH** **RSH, RSR′, R3P**

**NH3, RMgBr, RLi** **Br [–]** alkenes, aromatic rings

Not only can nucleophiles be classifi ed as hard or soft, but electrophiles can too. For example, H[+] is a very hard electrophile because it is small and charged, while Br2 is a soft electrophile: its orbitals are diffuse and it is uncharged. You saw Br2 reacting with an alkene earlier
in the chapter, and we explained in Chapter 5 that this reaction happens solely because of
orbital interactions: no charges are involved.



- We introduced the terms
**hard and soft in relation to**
nucleophiles in Chapter 15,
p. 357,



- **Hard/soft reactivity**

**•** **Reactions of hard species are dominated by charges and electrostatic effects.**

**•** **Reactions of soft species are dominated by orbital effects.**

**•** **Hard nucleophiles tend to react well with hard electrophiles.**

**•** **Soft nucleophiles tend to react well with soft electrophiles.**


What has all this to do with the conjugate addition of thiols? Well, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound is unusual in that it has two electrophilic sites, one of which is hard and one
of which is soft. The carbonyl group has a high partial charge on the carbonyl carbon and will
tend to react with hard nucleophiles, such as organolithium and Grignard reagents, that have
a high partial charge on the nucleophilic carbon atom. Conversely, the β carbon of the α,βunsaturated carbonyl system does not have a high partial positive charge but is the site of the
largest coeffi cient in the LUMO. This makes the β carbon a soft electrophile and likely to react
well with soft nucleophiles such as thiols.



- **Hard/soft—direct/conjugate addition**

**•** **Hard nucleophiles tend to react at the carbonyl carbon (hard) of an enone.**

**•** **Soft nucleophiles tend to react at the ββ carbon (soft) of an enone and lead to conjugate**
**addition.**

###### Promoting conjugate addition with copper(I) salts

Grignard reagents add directly to the carbonyl group of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and
ketones to give allylic alcohols: you have seen several examples of this, and you can now
explain it by saying that the hard Grignard reagent prefers to attack the harder C=O rather
than the softer C=C electrophilic centre. Here is a further example—the addition of MeMgBr
to a cyclic ketone to give an allylic alcohol, plus, as it happens, some of a diene that arises from
this alcohol by loss of water (dehydration). Below this example is the same reaction to which
a very small amount (just 0.01 equivalents, that is, 1%) of copper(I) chloride has been added.
The effect of the copper is dramatic: it makes the Grignard reagent undergo conjugate addition, with only a trace of the diene.

###### Organocopper reagents undergo conjugate addition

The copper works by transmetallating the Grignard reagent to give an organocopper reagent—
simply put, the magnesium is exchanged for copper. Organocoppers are softer than Grignard
reagents, and add in a conjugate fashion to the softer C=C double bond. Once the organocopper has added, the copper salt is available to transmetallate some more Grignard, and only
a catalytic amount is required.

**Me**
**Me**



- Organocoppers are softer
than Grignard reagents because
copper is less electropositive
than magnesium, so the C–Cu
bond is less polarized than the
C–Mg bond, giving the carbon
atom less of a partial negative
charge. Electronegativities:
Mg, 1.3; Cu, 1.9.

- As with many other
organometallic compounds, the
exact structure of these reagents
is more complex than we imply
here: they are probably

simplicity we will draw them as
monomers. Organometallics
(compounds with metal–carbon
bonds) get a chapter to
themselves (Chapter 40).


**Me**


The organocopper is shown here as ‘Me–Cu’ because its precise structure is not known.
But there are other organocopper reagents that also undergo conjugate addition and are
much better understood. The simplest result from the reaction of two equivalents of organolithium with one equivalent of a copper (I) salt such as CuBr in ether or THF solvent at low
temperature. The lithium cuprates (R2CuLi) that are formed are not stable and must be used
immediately.

###### Summary: factors controlling conjugate addition

At this point in the chapter it is worthwhile talking stock of the factors controlling the two
modes of addition to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.

For reactions where strong
nucleophiles do attack C≡N—
partly because they have nothing
else to attack—see pp. 220
and 231.


###### Extending the reaction to other electron-defi cient alkenes

It’s not only carbonyl-based groups that make alkenes react with nucleophiles rather than the
more usual electrophiles. Other electron-withdrawing groups do just the same thing. Here are
two examples: a nitrile and a nitro group. These compound classes appeared in Chapter 21 in
the context of aromatic substitution reactions where we saw them pulling electron density
away from the ring. The same thing happens here.

###### Unsaturated nitriles and nitro compounds

The simplest conjugated nitrile is acrylonitrile. This compound adds amines readily. No special conditions are needed to encourage attack at C=C rather than C≡N because the nitrile
carbon is rather unreactive as an electrophilic centre.

The amine fi rst attacks the alkene in a typical conjugate addition to make an anion stabilized by being next to the nitrile. The anion can have its charge drawn on C or N: it is delocalized like an enolate. Do not be put off by the odd appearance of the ‘enolate’. The dot between
the two double bonds is a reminder that there is a linear sp carbon atom at this point.

Other elements such as O, S, or P can add too. Phenyl phosphine can undergo a double addition just as in the last example, but alcohols can add only once. If there is competition between
a fi rst-row (for example N or O) and a second-row (for example S or P) element, the second-row
element normally wins, for the reasons discussed above (p. 507).

The nitro group (NO2) is extremely electron-withdrawing—about twice as electron-withdrawing as a carbonyl group. It is also unreactive as an electrophilic centre, which makes
conjugate addition to nitro-alkenes a very reliable reaction. In this example, sodium borohydride attacks the C=C bond in a conjugate manner to give an intermediate looking rather
like an enolate anion, with a negatively charged oxygen atom conjugated to an (N=C) double
bond. It reacts like an enolate too, picking up a proton on carbon to re-form the nitro group
and give a stable product.

###### Conjugate substitution reactions

Just as direct addition to C=O (Chapter 6) becomes substitution at C=O (Chapter 10) when
there is a leaving group at the carbonyl carbon, so conjugate _addition becomes conjugate_
_substitution if there is a leaving group, such as Cl, at the β carbon atom. Here is an example:_
substitution replaces Cl with OMe, just as it would have done in a reaction with an acyl
chloride.

As with substitution at C=O, this apparently simple reaction does not involve a direct displacement of the leaving group in a single step. The mechanism starts in exactly the same way

At fi rst sight, the product looks rather unstable—sensitive to water, or traces of acid perhaps.
But, in fact, it is remarkably resistant to reaction with both. The reason is conjugation: this isn’t
really an amine (or a diamine) at all because the lone pairs of the nitrogen atoms are delocalized
through into the carbonyl group, very much as they are in an amide. This makes them less
basic, and makes the carbonyl group less electrophilic.

###### Nucleophilic epoxidation

The conjugate substitutions we have just been discussing rely on a starting material containing a leaving group. In this section we are going to look at what happens if the leaving group
is not attached to the unsaturated carbonyl compound, but instead is attached to the nucleophile. We shall look at this class of compounds—nucleophiles with leaving groups attached—
in more detail in Chapter 38), but for the moment the most important will be hydroperoxide,
the anion of hydrogen peroxide.
Hydroperoxide is a good nucleophile because of the alpha effect: interaction of the two
lone pairs on adjacent oxygen atoms raises the HOMO of the anion and makes it a better
and softer nucleophile than hydroxide. Hydroperoxide is also less basic than hydroxide
because of the inductive electron-withdrawing effect of the second oxygen atom. Basicity
and nucleophilicity usually go hand in hand—not here though. This means that the
hydroperoxide anion can be formed by treating hydrogen peroxide with aqueous sodium
hydroxide.

But the product is not stable because hydroxide can be lost from the oxygen atom that was
the nucleophile. Hydroxide is fi ne as a leaving group here—after all, hydroxide is lost from
enolates in E1cB eliminations, and here the bond breaking is a weak O–O bond. The product
is an epoxide.

The electrophilic epoxidizing agents such as m-CPBA, which you met in Chapter 19, work
reliably only with nucleophilic alkenes, and for α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and
other electron-defi cient alkenes, hydroperoxide—a nucleophilic epoxidizing agent—is often
used instead.
There is another signifi cant difference between hydrogen peroxide and _m-CPBA, high-_

###### Nucleophilic aromatic substitution

In this next section we are going to consider reactions related to conjugate substitutions but
in which the double bond is part of an aromatic ring. We spent some considerable time in
Chapter 21 explaining that aromatic rings are _nucleophilic: electrophiles attack them, and_
typical aromatic reactivity is to undergo electrophilic substitution.
In general, nucleophilic substitutions of aromatic halides—such as the one proposed
here in which hydroxide is attempting to displace bromide—do not happen. You might
well ask, ‘Why not?’ The reaction looks all right and, if the ring were saturated, it would be
all right.
This is an SN2 reaction, and we know (Chapter 15) that attack must occur in line with the
C–Br bond from the back, where the largest lobe of the σ* orbitals lies. That is perfectly all
right for the aliphatic ring because the carbon atom is tetrahedral and the C–Br bond is not in
the plane of the ring. Substitution of an equatorial bromine goes like this:

**OH**


**HO**


But in the aromatic compound, the C–Br bond is in the plane of the ring as the carbon atom
is trigonal. To attack from the back, the nucleophile would have to appear inside the benzene
ring and invert the carbon atom in an absurd way. This reaction is of course not possible.
This is another example of the general rule:



- **SN2 at sp[2] C does not occur.**


If SN2 is impossible, what about SN1? This is possible but very unfavourable unless the leaving group is an exceptionally good one (see below for an example). It would involve the
unaided loss of the leaving group and the formation of an aryl cation. All the cations we saw
as intermediates in the SN1 reaction (Chapter 15) were planar with an empty p orbital. This
cation is planar but the p orbital is full—it is part of the aromatic ring—and the empty orbital
is an sp[2] orbital outside the ring.
Yet some aromatic compounds do undergo nucleophilic substitution. Just as normally
nucleophilic alkenes can be made to undergo conjugate substitution if they carry ele ctronwithdrawing substituents, so normally nucleophilic aromatic rings also become electrophilic if they have the right substituents. The mechanism by which they undergo
nucleophilic substitution also closely parallels that of conjugate substitution which you
have just seen.

###### The addition–elimination mechanism

Imagine a cyclic β-fl uoro-enone reacting with a secondary amine in a conjugate substitution
reaction. The normal addition to form the enolate followed by return of the negative charge
to expel the fl uoride ion gives the product.

**F** **O** **R2N** **F** **O** **NR2** **O**

Now imagine just the same reaction with two extra double bonds in the ring. These play no
part in our mechanism; they just make what was an aliphatic ring into an aromatic one.

**R2NH** addition elimination

The mechanism involves addition of the nucleophile followed by elimination of the leaving
group—the **addition–elimination mechanism. It is not necessary to have a carbonyl**
group—any electron-withdrawing group will do—the only requirement is that the electrons
must be able to get out of the ring into this anion-stabilizing group. Here is an example with
a para-nitro group.

Everything is different about this example—the nucleophile (HO[−]), the leaving group (Cl[−]),
the anion-stabilizing group (NO2), and its position (para)—but the reaction still works. The
nucleophile is a good one, the negative charge can be pushed through on to the oxygen
atom(s) of the nitro group, and chloride is a better leaving group than OH.



- **A typical nucleophilic aromatic substitution has:**

**•** **an oxygen, nitrogen, or cyanide nucleophile**

**•** **a halide for a leaving group**

**•** **a carbonyl, nitro, or cyanide group ortho and/or para to the leaving group.**


Since the nitro group is usually introduced by electrophilic aromatic substitution (Chapter
21) and halides direct _ortho/para in nitration reactions, a common sequence is nitration_
followed by nucleophilic substitution.

- If you try and do the same
reaction with a meta anionstabilizing group, it doesn’t
work. You can’t draw the
arrows to push the electrons
through on to the oxygen atom.
Try it yourself.


This sequence is useful because the nitro group could not be added directly to give the fi nal
product as nitration would go in the wrong position. The nitrile is meta-directing, while the
alkyl group (R) is ortho, para-directing.
Two activating electron-withdrawing groups are better than one and dinitration of chlorobenzene makes a very electrophilic aryl halide. Reaction with hydrazine gives a useful
reagent.

###### The intermediate in the addition–elimination mechanism

What evidence is there for intermediates like the ones we have been using in this section?
When reactions like this last example are carried out, a purple colour often appears in
the reaction mixture and then fades away. In some cases the colour is persistent and
thought to be due to the intermediate. Here is an example with RO[−] attacking a nitrated
aniline. This intermediate is persistent because neither potential leaving group (NR2 or
OR) is very good.

delocalization of the negative charge in the intermediate


-----

What is the nature of this intermediate? Well, in essence it is an anion delocalized over fi ve
sp[2] hybridized carbons of a six-membered ring (the sixth, the point at which the nucleophile
attacked, is sp[3] hybridized). It’s possible to make a simple homologue of such a species by
deprotonating cyclohexadiene. Delocalizing the anion generates the three structures below.

You’ve seen before that [13]C NMR spectra are revealing when it comes to distribution of
charge, and the details of the [13]C NMR spectrum of this anion are shown below, along with
those of benzene itself and also of the cation generated by protonating benzene (which, as you
will remember from Chapter 21, corresponds to the intermediate generated in electrophilic
aromatic substitution).

δC 178.1



- A reminder: A larger shift
means less electronic shielding
and a smaller shift more
electronic shielding.


δC 78.0


These results are very striking. The shifts of the meta carbons in both ions are very slightly
different from those of benzene itself (about 130 ppm). But the _ortho and_ _para carbons in_
the anion have gone upfi eld to much smaller shifts, indicating greater electron density. By
contrast, ortho and para carbons in the cation have gone downfi eld to much larger shifts.
The differences are very great—about 100 ppm between the cation and the anion! It is very
clear from these spectra that the ionic charge is delocalized almost exclusively to the ortho and
_para carbons in both cases. The alternative structures in the margin show this delocalization._
This means that stabilizing groups, such as nitro or carbonyl in the case of the anion, can
only have an effect if they are on carbons ortho or para to the position being attacked by the
nucleophile. A good illustration of this is the selective displacement of one chlorine atom out
of these two. The chlorine ortho to the nitro group is lost; the one meta is retained.



- Remember, charges in
brackets show signifi cant (here
ca. 1/3) portions of a charge, in
contrast with δ, which means a
much smaller polarization.

The mechanism works well if the nucleophile (the anion derived from the thiol) attacks
the carbon bearing the chlorine ortho to the nitro group as the negative charge can then be
pushed into the nitro group. Satisfy yourself that you cannot do this if you attack the other
chlorine position. This is a very practical reaction and is used in the manufacture of a
tranquillizing drug.

###### The leaving group and the mechanism

In the fi rst nucleophilic aromatic substitution that we showed you, we used fl uoride ion as
a leaving group. Fluoride works very well in these reactions and even such a simple compound as 2-halo-l-nitrophenyl fl uoride reacts effi ciently with a variety of nucleophiles, as in
these examples.

This reaction is never used:


The same reactions happen with the other 2-halo-l-nirtobenzenes but less effi ciently. The
fl uoro-compound reacts about 10[2]–10[3] times faster than the chloro or bromo compounds and
the iodo compound is even slower.
This ought to surprise you. When we were looking at other nucleophilic substitutions such
as those at the carbonyl group or saturated carbon, we never used fl uoride as a leaving group!
The C–F bond is very strong—the strongest of all the single bonds to carbon—and it is diffi cult to break. As a consequence, these reactions are not a good prospect:


This reaction is rarely used:

**use instead Cl, Br, or I (I is best)**


**Nu**


So why is fl uoride so good in nucleophilic aromatic substitution when the reverse is true
with other reactions? You will notice that we have not said that fl uoride is a better leaving
group in nucleophilic aromatic substitution. It isn’t! The explanation depends on a better
understanding of the mechanism of the reaction. We shall use azide ion as our nucleophile
because this has been well studied and because it is one of the best.
The mechanism is exactly the same as that we have been discussing all along—a two-stage
addition–elimination sequence. In a two-step mechanism, one step is slower and rate determining; the other is unimportant to the rate. You may guess that, in the mechanism for
nucleophilic aromatic substitution, it is the fi rst step that is slower because it disturbs the
aromaticity. The second step restores the aromaticity and is faster. The effect of fl uoride, or
any other leaving group, can only come from its effect on the fi rst step. How good a leaving
group it might be does not matter: the rate of the second step—the step where fl uoride leaves—
has no effect on the overall rate of the reaction.



- Note carefully that this is an
inductive effect: there are no
arrows to be drawn to show
how fl uorine withdraws
electrons—it does it just by
polarizing C–F bonds towards
itself. Contrast the electronwithdrawing effect of the nitro
group, which works (mainly)
by conjugation.


Fluoride accelerates the fi rst step through its inductive effect. It is the most electronegative
element of all and it stabilizes the anionic intermediate, assisting the acceptance of electrons
by the benzene ring.

###### The activating anion-stabilizing substituent

We have used nitro groups very extensively so far because they are the best at stabilizing the
anionic intermediate. Others that work include carbonyl, cyanide, and sulfur-based groups
such as sulfoxides and sulfones. A direct comparison of the different groups Z that can assist
the displacement of bromide (by the secondary amine piperidine in this example) is shown in

All the compounds react more slowly than the nitro compound. We have already mentioned (Chapters 8 and 21) the great electron-withdrawing power of the nitro group—here is
a new measure of that power. The sulfone reacts 18 times slower, the nitrile 32 times slower,
and the ketone 80 times slower.
Nitro is the best activating group, but the others will all perform well, especially when combined with a fl uoride rather than a bromide as the leaving group. Here are two reactions that
work well in a preparative sense with other anion-stabilizing groups. Note that the trifl uoromethyl group works by using only its powerful inductive effect.

**An anion-stabilizing (electron-withdrawing) group ortho or para to a potential leaving group**
**can be used to facilitate nucleophilic aromatic substitution.**

Nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings is possible by alternative mechanisms as well.
We will now turn to these.

###### The SN1 mechanism for nucleophilic aromatic substitution: diazonium compounds

If we really want to make aromatic compounds undergo nucleophilic substitution in a general
way, the way to do it is to use absolutely the best leaving group of all—nitrogen gas. In fact,
the diazonium compound below is so good at nucleophilic aromatic substitution that is does
so even without activating groups. On warming, the nitrogen molecule just departs, leaving
behind a cation, which is captured by a nucleophile, in this case water. Do you fi nd this reminiscent of the SN1 reaction? We hope so.


**N**

-----

Before we talk about this group of aromatic SN1 reactions in more detail, let’s consider how
to make the diazonium salt. The reagent we need is the reactive nitrogen electrophile NO[+].
You met NO[+] in Chapter 20, but to remind you, it forms when the nitrite anion (usually
sodium nitrite) is treated with acid at around 0 °C. Protonation of nitrite gives nitrous acid,
HONO; protonation again gives a cation, which can lose water to form NO[+]. Butyl nitrite (or
other alkyl nitrites) can also be used as a source of NO[+].

A diazonium salt is formed when NO[+] reacts with an amine. The lone pair of the amine
attacks the NO[+] cation, and then water is lost. The mechanism is actually quite simple, but it
does involve a lot of proton transfers. There is, of course, an anion associated with the nitrogen cation, and this will be the conjugate base (Cl[−] usually) of the acid used to form NO[+]. This
reaction is known as diazotization.

If the amine is an alkyl amine, this diazonium salt is very unstable and immediately loses
nitrogen gas to give a planar carbocation, which normally reacts with a nucleophile in an SN1
process (Chapter 15), loses a proton in an E1 process (Chapter 17), or rearranges (Chapter 36).
It may, for example, react with water to give an alcohol:

with empty p orbital

If the amine is an aryl amine, then the reaction you saw at the beginning of this section will
take place and a phenol will form. This is in fact rather a useful reaction as it is diffi cult to add
an oxygen atom to a benzene ring by normal electrophilic substitution: there is no good reagent for OH[+]. A nitrogen atom can be added easily by nitration, and reduction and diazotization provide a way of replacing the nitro group by a hydroxyl group.

- Aryl iodides have wide utility
in the coupling chemistry,
catalysed by Pd and other
transition metals, that you will
meet in Chapter 40.


However, an aryl carbocation is much less stable than an alkyl carbocation because its
empty orbital is an sp[2] rather than a p orbital. This makes the loss of nitrogen slower. If the
diazotization is done at temperatures around 0 °C (classically at 5 °C), the diazonium salt is
stable and can be reacted with various nucleophiles other than water.

###### Other nucleophiles

Aryl iodides are not as easy to make by electrophilic substitution as aryl chlorides or bromides
because iodine is not reactive enough to attack benzene rings. But adding potassium iodide to
the diazonium salt gives an aryl iodide by nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Other nucleophiles, such as chloride, bromide, and cyanide, are best added as copper(I)
salts. Since aromatic amines are usually made by reduction of nitro compounds, a common
sequence of reactions goes like this:

**X**


As often in aromatic chemistry, it’s the versatility of the nitro group that makes this sequence
work—easy introduction by electrophilic substitution, easy reduction, and easy nucleophilic
substitution of its diazonium derivative.

###### The benzyne mechanism

We now need to introduce you to one last mechanism for aromatic nucleophilic substitution
and you may well feel that this is the weirdest mechanism you have yet seen with the most
unlikely intermediate ever! For our part, we hope to convince you that this mechanism is not
only possible but also useful.
Earlier in this chapter we said that the displacement by nucleophiles of bromide from
bromobenzene does not occur. In fact substitution reactions of bromobenzene can occur but
only under the most vigorous conditions, such as when bromobenzene and NaOH are melted
together (fused) at very high temperature. A similar reaction with the very powerful reagent
NaNH2 (which supplies NH2− ion) also happens, at a rather lower temperature.

**NH2** **NaNH2** **Br** **NaOH** **OH**

**NH3(l)** fuse

These reactions were known for a long time before anyone saw what was happening. They do
not happen by an SN2 mechanism, as we explained earlier, and they can’t happen by the
addition–elimination mechanism because there is nothing to stabilize the negative charge in the
intermediate. The fi rst clue to the true mechanism is that all the nucleophiles that react in this
way are very basic. They start the reaction off by removing a proton ortho to the leaving group.


**Br**

**H**


**NH2**


**Br**

filled sp[2] orbital


The carbanion is in an sp[2] orbital in the plane of the ring. Indeed, this intermediate is very
similar to the aryl cation intermediate in the SN1 mechanism from diazonium salts. That had
no electrons in the sp[2] orbital; the carbanion has two. Why should this proton be removed
rather than any other? The bromine atom is electronegative and the C–Br bond is in the plane
of the sp[2] orbital and removes electrons from it. The stabilization is nonetheless weak and
only exceptionally strong bases will do this reaction.
The next step is the loss of bromide ion in an elimination reaction. This is the step that is diffi cult to believe as the intermediate we are proposing looks impossible. The orbitals are bad for
the elimination too—it is a syn- rather than an anti-periplanar elimination. But it happens.

**Br**

benzyne

The intermediate is called benzyne as it is an alkyne with a triple bond in a benzene ring.
But what does this triple bond mean? It certainly isn’t a normal alkyne as these are linear. In
fact one π bond is normal—it is just part of the aromatic system. One π bond—the new one—is
abnormal and is formed by overlap of two sp[2] orbitals outside the ring. This external π bond


-----

is very weak and benzyne is a very unstable intermediate. Indeed, when the structure was
proposed few chemists believed it and some pretty solid evidence was needed before they did.
We shall come to that shortly, but let us fi rst fi nish the mechanism. Unlike normal alkynes,
benzyne is electrophilic as the weak third bond can be attacked by nucleophiles.


**NH2**


**NH2**


**NH2**

**H** **NH2**



- DMSO (see p. 255) solvates
K[+] but not RO[−].


The whole mechanism from bromobenzene to aniline involves an elimination to give
benzyne followed by an addition of the nucleophile to the triple bond of benzyne. In many
ways, this mechanism is the reverse of the normal addition–elimination mechanism for
nucleophilic aromatic substitution and it is sometimes called the **elimination–addition**
**mechanism.**
Any nucleophile basic enough to remove the _ortho proton can carry out this reaction._
Known examples include oxyanions, amide anions (R2N[−]), and carbanions. The rather basic
alkoxide t-butoxide will do the reaction on bromobenzene if the potassium salt is used in the
dipolar aprotic solvent DMSO to maximize reactivity.


**Br**

**H**


**H** **Ot-Bu**

**Ot-Bu** benzyne **H**

One rather special feature of the benzyne mechanism allows us to be certain that this proposed mechanism is correct, and this is the fact that the triple bond could in principle be
attacked by nucleophiles at either end. This is of no consequence with bromobenzene as the
products would be the same, but we can make the ends of the triple bond different and then
we see something interesting. ortho-Chloro aryl ethers are easy to prepare by chlorination of
the ether (Chapter 21). When these compounds are treated with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia, a
single amine is formed in good yield.

The new amino group fi nds itself in the meta position even though the chlorine was at the

ism. Using the same elimination–addition sequence, this must be the mechanism:

- Steric hindrance is not nearly
as important in electrophilic
substitution or in nucleophilic
substitution by the addition–
elimination mechanism. In both
of these reactions, the reagent is
attacking the p orbital at right
angles to the ring and is some
distance from an ortho
substituent.


That shows how the meta product might be formed, but why should it be formed? Attack
could also occur at the ortho position, so why is there no ortho product? There are two reasons:
electronic and steric. Electronically, the anion next to the electronegative oxygen atom is
preferred because oxygen is inductively electron-withdrawing. The same factor facilitates
deprotonation next to Cl in the formation of the benzyne. Sterically, it is better for the amide
anion to attack away from the OMe group rather than come in alongside it. Nucleophilic
attack on a benzyne has to occur in the plane of the benzene ring because that is where the
orbitals are. This reaction is therefore very sensitive to steric hindrance as the nucleophile
must attack in the plane of the substituent as well.

This is a useful way to make amino ethers with a meta relationship as both groups are ortho,

_para-Disubstituted halides can again give only one benzyne and most of them give mixtures of_
products. A simple alkyl substituent is too far from the triple bond to have much steric effect.

###### Selectivity

Most organic molecules contain more than one functional group, and most functional groups
can react in more than one way, so organic chemists often have to predict which functional
group will react, where it will react, and how it will react. These questions are what we call
_selectivity._
Selectivity comes in three sorts: chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity.
Chemoselectivity is which group reacts; regioselectivity is where it reacts. Stereoselectivity is
_how the group reacts with regard to the stereochemistry of the product._



- **Selectivity**

**There are three main types of selectivity:**

**•** **chemoselectivity: which functional group will react (this chapter)**

**•** **regioselectivity: where it will react (Chapter 24)**

**•** **stereoselectivity: how it will react (stereochemistry of the products) (Chapters 32, 33, and 41)**


We have talked a lot about regioselectivity, without calling it that, in the last two chapters.
In Chapter 21 you learned how to predict and explain which product(s) you get from electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. The functional group is the aromatic ring: _where it_
reacts is the reaction’s regioselectivity. In Chapter 22 you saw that nucleophilic addition to an
unsaturated ketone can take place in a 1,2- or 1,4-fashion—the question of which happens
(where the unsaturated ketone reacts) is a question of regioselectivity. We will address regioselectivity in much more detail in the next chapter.

But this chapter is about chemoselectivity—in a compound with more than one functional
group, which group reacts? Let’s start with a straightforward example—the synthesis of the
painkiller paracetamol. 4-Aminophenol could react with acetic anhydride at both nitrogen
and oxygen to give a compound containing an amide and an ester functional group. This is
what happens on heating with excess acetic anhydride (Ac2O) in toluene.

But with just one equivalent of acetic anhydride in the presence of a base (pyridine) only the
NH2 group is acylated, and paracetamol is the product. This is chemoselectivity, and it is to be
expected that the NH2 group is more nucleophilic than the OH group. It is even possible to
hydrolyse the doubly acetylated product to paracetamol with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The
ester is more reactive than the amide and hydrolyses much more easily. This is another chemoselective reaction.


Why amines are more
nucleophilic than alcohols and why
esters are more reactive than
amides was all explained in
Chapter 10.

We know that ketones are more reactive towards Grignard reagents and organolithiums
than esters because you can’t isolate a ketone from the reaction of an ester with a Grignard
reagent or an organolithium. Chemists at the pharmaceutical company Pfi zer made use of
this fact while they were developing anticonvulsants related to the tranquillizer oblivon. By
adding lithium acetylide to ketones, they were able to make a tertiary alcohol by chemoselective reaction of a ketone in the presence of an ester.

These last two reactions work because, although each starting material contains two carbonyl groups, one is more electrophilic and therefore more reactive towards nucleophiles
(OH[−] in the fi rst case; lithium acetylide in the second) than the other. We can order carbonyl
compounds into a sequence in which it will usually be possible to react those on the left with
nucleophiles in the presence of those on the right.


-----

We’ve already discussed this sequence of reactivity in relation to acid derivatives in
Chapter 10—make sure you understand the reason for the ordering of ester > amide >
carboxylate. Here we’re adding to the list aldehyde (the most reactive, for steric reasons—it is
the least hindered) and ketone (more reactive than esters because the carbonyl group is not
stabilized by conjugation with a lone pair).

###### Reducing agents

Chemists at Glaxo exploited this reactivity sequence in their synthesis of the anti-asthma
drug salmefamol (sister compound to the bestseller salbutamol). Three reducing agents are
used in the sequence: sodium borohydride (NaBH4), hydrogen gas over a palladium catalyst,
and lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4).

###### Why not use LiAlH4 all the time?

In general, it’s best to use the
mildest conditions possible for
any particular reaction—the
potential for unwanted sidereactions is lessened. What is
more, NaBH4 is a lot easier to
handle than LiAlH4—for example, it simply dissolves in water
while LiAlH4 catches fi re if it gets
wet. NaBH4 is usually used to
reduce aldehydes and ketones,
even though LiAlH4 also works.

- It is worth noticing that all of
the reducing agents for carbonyl
groups described in this section
are hydrides of boron or
aluminium.


We shall use this synthesis as a basis for discussion on chemoselectivity in reductions.
In the fi rst step, sodium borohydride leaves the carbonyl group of the ester untouched
while it reduces the ketone (in orange); in the last step, lithium aluminium hydride reduces
the ester (in black). These chemoselectivities are typical of these two most commonly used
reducing agents: borohydride can usually be relied upon to reduce an aldehyde or a ketone
in the presence of an ester, while lithium aluminium hydride will reduce almost any
carbonyl group.

###### Reduction of carbonyl groups

We should now look in detail at reductions of carbonyl compounds, and in doing so we shall
introduce a few more specialized reducing agents. Then we will come back to the other type
of reduction in the salmefamol synthesis—catalytic hydrogenation.

###### How to reduce aldehydes and ketones to alcohols

We don’t need to spend much time on this—sodium borohydride, which you met in
Chapter 6, does it very well. Sodium borohydride will reduce only in protic solvents (usually ethanol or methanol) or in the presence of electrophilic metal cations such as Li[+] or
Mg[2][+] (LiBH4 can be used in THF, for example). The mechanism follows a course which can
be represented like this.

negative charge on oxygen is protonated by the alcohol, and resulting alkoxide adds to the
boron during or immediately after the reduction. The by-product, an alkoxyborohydride
anion, is itself a reducing agent, and can go on to reduce three more molecules of carbonyl
compound, transferring step-by-step all of its hydrogen atoms.

###### How to reduce esters to alcohols

LiAlH4 is often the best reagent, and gives alcohols by the mechanism we discussed in Chapter
10 (p. 217). As a milder alternative (needed because LiAlH4 has caused countless fi res through
careless handling), lithium borohydride in alcoholic solution will reduce esters—in fact, it has
useful selectivity for esters over acids or amides that LiAlH4 does not have. _Sodium boro-_
hydride reduces most esters only very slowly.

###### How to reduce amides to amines

Again, LiAlH4 is a good reagent for this transformation. The mechanism follows a similar
course to the reduction of esters: both are written out in detail below, and there is a key difference at the steps boxed in orange and in green. In the orange box, loss of alkoxide from the
tetrahedral intermediate forms an aldehyde, which is reduced further. This doesn’t happen
with amides; instead the anionic oxygen is lost—assisted by coordination to aluminium—to
form an iminium ion. A good alternative for the reduction of amides to amines is borane
(BH3), described in the next section.

The best reagent for this is borane, BH3. Borane is, in fact, a gas with the structure B2H6, but

acyl chlorides and esters are relatively electron-poor (Cl and OR are very electronegative);
borane will not touch acyl chlorides and reduces esters only slowly. But it will reduce very
effectively both carboxylic acids and amides.
Borane reacts with carboxylic acids fi rst of all to form triacylborates, with evolution of
hydrogen gas. Esters are usually less electrophilic than ketones because of conjugation
between the carbonyl group and the lone pair of the sp[3] hybridized oxygen atom—but, in
these boron esters, the oxygen next to the boron has to share its lone pair between the carbonyl
group and the boron’s empty p orbital, so they are considerably more reactive than normal
esters.

Borane and lithium borohydride are a most useful pair of reducing agents, with opposite
selectivities. Japanese chemists used an enzyme to make a single enantiomer of the acid
below, and were able to reduce either the ester or the carboxylic acid by choosing lithium
borohydride or borane as their reagent. Check for yourself that the lactones (cyclic esters) in
black frames are enantiomers.

The carbonyl group of an amide is electron-rich because it receives electron density from
the delocalized N lone pair. It therefore complexes well with the empty p orbital of the Lewis
acidic borane. Hydride transfer is then possible from anionic boron to electrophilic carbon.
The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses to an iminium ion that is reduced again by
the borane.

###### How to reduce esters or amides to aldehydes

The step boxed in orange in the ester reduction scheme on p. 531 gave an aldehyde. The aldehyde is more readily reduced than the ester, so the reduction doesn’t stop there, but carries on
to the alcohol oxidation level. How, then, can you reduce an ester to an aldehyde? This is a real
problem in synthetic chemistry—the ester below, for example, is easy to make by methods
you will meet in Chapter 25, but an important synthesis of the antibiotic monensin requires
the aldehyde.

In this case, the chemists decided simply to put up with the fact that LiAlH4 gives the alcohol, and oxidize the alcohol back to the aldehyde using chromium(VI), the oxidant you met
in Chapter 9 (p. 194). There is, however, a reagent that will sometimes do the job in a single
step, although you must bear in mind that this is not at all a general reaction. The reagent is
known as DIBAL or DIBALH—diisobutyl aluminium hydride, i-Bu2AlH.
DIBAL is an alane: its structure is shown in the margin. Its chemistry is in many ways like
borane—it exists as a bridged dimer, and it becomes a reducing agent only after it has formed
a Lewis acid–base complex, so like borane it too reduces electron-rich carbonyl groups most
rapidly. DIBAL will reduce esters even at –70 °C, and at this temperature the tetrahedral intermediate, formed by the transfer of hydride from aluminium to carbon (and shown below),
may be stable. Only in the aqueous work-up does it collapse to the aldehyde. This step also
destroys any excess DIBAL so no further reduction is possible.

In the amide reduction scheme on p. 533, the step framed in green gives an iminium ion.
Stopping the reaction before the iminium ion forms would therefore provide a way of making
aldehydes from amides because in the absence of the aluminium, this tetrahedral intermediate collapses to an aldehyde. Because tetrahedral intermediates like these formed during
amide reduction are rather more stable than those from ester reduction, this can often be
achieved simply by carrying out the amide reduction and quenching with water, all at 0 °C.

###### Hydrogen as a reducing agent: catalytic hydrogenation

The simplest reducing agent is hydrogen itself, H2. Hydrogen can’t generally be used as a
reducing agent for carbonyl compounds—it isn’t nucleophilic enough. However, it can act as

|via alcohol or DIBAL|LiAlH4, 0 °C|via acyl chloride (see later)|
|---|---|---|


-----

a reducing agent for other, weaker, double and triple bonds, such as C=C, C=N, C≡C and
C≡N. To do these reactions, a metal catalyst is required and the process is known as catalytic
hydrogenation. The hydrogen is provided by a cylinder, perhaps via a balloon, or can be made
by electrolysis and pumped with the substrate over the catalyst. In the example below, the
alkene is reduced while the aldehyde remains untouched.

**CHO** **H2, Pd/C** **CHO**

75 °C

The catalysts used to make hydrogen react with double bonds are transition metals:
usually palladium (as in this example) or platinum, but sometimes nickel, rhodium, or
ruthenium. We will talk about several different reductions in this section, but the mechanisms of all of them are similar, and very different from those involved in carbonyl
reductions.
Catalytic hydrogenation takes place on the surface of the metal. The metal must therefore
be fi nely divided, and is usually dispersed on the surface of an inert support. This is what
‘Pd/C’ means—fi nely divided palladium carried on a charcoal support. The fi rst step is chemical absorption of hydrogen onto the metal surface, a process that results in breakage of the
H–H bonds and distributes hydrogen atoms where they can react with the organic substrate.
Now the alkene can also bond to the metal, and hydrogen can be transferred from the metal
to the alkene.


###### Palladium on charcoal

Palladium on charcoal (Pd/C) is
usually 5–10% by mass Pd and
90–95% C. It is made by
suspending charcoal powder in a
PdCl2 solution, and then reducing
the PdCl2 to Pd metal, usually
with H2 gas, but sometimes with
formaldehyde, HCHO (which is
oxidized to formic acid, HCO2H).
The palladium metal precipitates
on to the charcoal, which can be
fi ltered off and dried. The fi ne Pd
particles present maximum surface area to the reaction they
catalyse and, while Pd is an
expensive metal, it is recyclable
since the Pd/C is insoluble and
can be recovered by fi ltration.

###### How to reduce alkenes to alkanes

Hydrogenation with a palladium or a platinum catalyst is the most common way of reducing
alkenes. You may fi nd our mechanism rather unsatisfactory, but it is hard to draw curly arrows
for the reactions involved here. There is, however, plenty of evidence that the hydrogenation
occurs like this, for example the alkene below reacts in such a way that the major product
receives both hydrogen atoms on the same face of the molecule—just what we would expect
from a reaction at a surface.

###### How to reduce α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds

It should not now surprise you that regioselective reduction of the C=C double bond of an
α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound is best done using catalytic hydrogenation as the C=C
bond is more susceptible to hydrogenation than the C=O bond. The fl avouring compound
known as raspberry ketone is made by this method.

**O** **O**


**H2, Pd/C**

But what if you want instead to reduce the C=O group selectively? You should immediately
think of using NaBH4. But in Chapter 22 we pointed out that hydride reducing agents in general are not good choices for the selective reduction of the C=O bond of unsaturated carbonyl
compounds because they tend to add to the double bond as well, giving fi rst the saturated
carbonyl compound, which is then reduced to the alcohol. The way to get regioselective
addition directly to the carbonyl group is to use NaBH4 in the presence of a hard, Lewis-acidic
metal salt, such as CeCl3. This combination of reagents is known as the Luche reduction.

Hydrogenation sometimes

hydrogen—100 atmospheres in

The catalyst used in each reduction can be a matter of trial and error, and it is diffi cult to
predict which metal will be most successful—generally Pt, Rh, or Ni is used for arenes.

###### How to reduce alkynes to alkenes

A catalyst known as Lindlar’s catalyst (which you will meet again in Chapter 27) is used to
reduce alkynes to alkenes, but does not easily reduce alkenes to alkanes. This requires rather
subtle chemoselectivity: alkenes are usually hydrogenated at least as fast as alkynes, so we
need to be sure the reaction stops once the alkene has been formed. The Lindlar catalyst is
a palladium catalyst (Pd/CaCO3) deliberately poisoned with lead. The lead lessens the activity of the catalyst and makes further reduction of the alkene product slow: most palladium
catalysts would reduce alkynes all the way to alkanes. Best selectivities are obtained if quinoline is also added to the reaction, and alkyne to alkene reductions work with Pd/
BaSO4 + quinoline too. Even so, Lindlar reactions often have to be monitored carefully to
make sure that over-reduction is not taking place.

###### Raney nickel

Nickel is often used for hydrogenation in a fi nely divided form
known as Raney nickel. Raney
nickel is made from a nickel–
aluminium alloy. The aluminium
is dissolved away using concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide,
leaving the nickel as a fi ne powder. The process liberates H2, and
some of this hydrogen remains
adsorbed on the nickel catalyst.
This means that some hydrogenations, particularly those of C–S
bonds, which you will come
across later in this chapter, can
be carried out just by using
freshly prepared Raney nickel,
with no added H2. Raney nickel is
abbreviated to RaNi—nothing to
do with radium, note!


###### How to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes

Catalytic hydrogenation is often chosen as a method for reduction because of its chemoselectivity for C=C over C=O groups, and an important hydrogenation involving a
carbonyl compound is not actually a reduction of the C=O double bond. Hydrogenation of
acyl chlor ides gives aldehydes in a reaction known as the Rosenmund reaction—really a
hydrogen olysis of a C–Cl bond.

This is a good way of reducing compounds at the carboxylic acid oxidation level to
aldehydes, which is why we included it in the table of carbonyl reductions on p. 534.

The quinoline is needed both to neutralize the HCl produced in the reaction and to moderate
the activity of the catalyst, preventing over-reduction.

###### Reductive amination by catalytic hydrogenation

The unreactivity of carbonyl groups towards catalytic hydrogenation allows us to use hydrogenation in a similar way to sodium cyanoborohydride to carry out reductive aminations of
amines and carbonyl compounds. For example, in the synthesis of salmefamol we presented
on p. 530, one step involves the formation of the imine from an amine and a ketone in the
presence of acid, hydrogen, and a palladium catalyst. The imine (in its protonated iminium
form) is hydrogenated to yield an amine, while the ketone (and the aromatic systems) remains
untouched.

###### How to reduce nitro groups to amines

In Chapters 21 and 22 we saw how the sequence of nitration of aromatic rings followed by
reduction was a useful route to aromatic amines. The reduction of the nitro group can be
carried out by Sn/HCl but catalytic hydrogenation is much simpler. The reaction is usually
done in ethanol with a Pd or Pt catalyst, and it may be necessary to add a weak acid to prevent the amine produced from poisoning the catalyst. The real gain over the Sn/HCl method
is in the work-up. Instead of separating and disposing of voluminous toxic tin residues, a
simple fi ltration to remove the catalyst, evaporation, and crystallization or distillation gives
the amine.

###### Hydrogenolysis: breaking C–O and C–N bonds

In the reductive amination above we skirted over the fact that the starting amine in the synthesis of salmefamol (look back at p. 530) in fact carries two benzyl groups, which disappear
during the hydrogenation.

What happens to them is a hydrogenolysis—a reaction that is liable to occur under catalytic hydrogenation conditions whenever a heteroatom (in particular O or N) fi nds itself

alcohols or ethers.

Hydrogenolysis happens under similar conditions to alkene hydrogenation, but involves
breakage of a C–O or C–N σ bond rather than a C=C π bond. It is particularly important for
removing benzyl protecting groups, to which we will return later in the chapter.

 - **We can draw up a sequence of reactivity towards hydrogenation. The precise ordering varies**
**with the catalyst, and some catalysts are particularly selective towards certain classes of**

###### Getting rid of functional groups

Functional groups can be useful for putting a molecule together, but they aren’t always needed
in the fi nal product. We need ways of getting rid of them. Hydrogenation of alkenes is one way
that you have seen. Hydrogenation of alkynes to alkanes is very useful because we can build
long chains of carbon atoms by alkylating alkynes, then hide the evidence by
hydrogenation:


**R[1]**


**BuLi** **R[1]**


**R[2]Br** **R[1]**


**H2, Pd/C** **R[1]**

**R[2]**


**R[2]**



- The hydrogenation uses Pd/C,
not the Lindlar catalyst of course,
because we want to go all the
way to the alkane.


**H**


**Li**


Alcohols can be got rid of either by elimination to alkenes and then hydrogenation or by
tosylation and substitution using borohydride to provide a nucleophilic hydrogen atom.


-----

99% yield



- Lithium triethylborohydride
is used here—it is particularly
good at these SN2
substitutions—but other
powerful hydride reducing
agents work too.


Removal of carbonyl groups is harder, although there are several possible methods. C–O
bonds are strong, but C–S bonds are much weaker and are often easily reduced with Raney
nickel. We can get rid of aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups by making them into thio**acetals, sulfur analogues of acetals, formed in a reaction analogous to acetal formation (see**
Chapter 11) but using a dithiol with a Lewis acid catalyst. Freshly prepared Raney nickel carries enough H2 (p. 537) to reduce the thioacetal without added hydrogen.

A slightly more vigorous method, known as the Wolff–Kishner reduction, is driven by the
elimination of nitrogen gas from a hydrazone. Hot concentrated sodium hydroxide solution
deprotonates the hydrazone, which can then lose nitrogen to form an alkyl anion, which is
immediately protonated by water.

The third method is the simplest to do, but has the most complicated mechanism. The
**Clemmensen reduction is also rather violent, and really reasonable only for compounds**
with just the one functional group. It uses zinc metal dissolving in concentrated hydrochloric
acid. As the metal dissolves, it gives up two electrons—in the absence of something else to do,
these electrons would reduce the H[+] in the acid to H2, and give ZnCl2 and H2. But in the presence of a carbonyl compound, the electrons go to reduce the C=O bond.



- You saw this reaction in
Chapter 21 as a useful way of
turning acylated arenes of the
type that are easy to make by
Friedel–Crafts acylation into
alkylated arenes of the type that
are hard to make by Friedel–
Crafts alkylation.


The mechanism has a good deal in common with a whole class of reductions, of which the
Clemmensen is a member, known as **dissolving metal reductions. We shall now look at**
these as our third (after metal hydrides and catalytic hydrogenation) important class of
reducing agents.

###### Dissolving metal reductions

You will be familiar with the idea that many metals react with acid to liberate hydrogen,
forming a salt at the same time. There is an example in the margin. The metal cation (Mg[2][+]
in this example) results from the loss of electrons, and these electrons reduce 2 × H[+] to
give H2.
The same thing happens even in very weak acids (water, alcohols. . .even liquid ammonia) if
the metal is very reactive (sodium or potassium, say). You can think of the process here in two
steps: fi rst sodium releases an electron, then the electron is captured by a proton from NH3 to
give H, which forms H2. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) and sodium amide (NaNH2, p. 171) are made
by dissolving sodium in ethanol or liquid ammonia, respectively.
But what if, instead of just reducing the solvent to liberate hydrogen, we harness the electrons by giving them a more easily reduced substrate instead? A dissolving metal reduction
results: note dissolving. The electrons have to be captured as the metal releases them, otherwise they will just reduce the solvent to give H2.


**Mg + 2HCl(aq)** **MgCl2 + H2**

**Na + NH3** **NaNH2 + 1/2 H2**

Dissolving metal reductions work because the electrons released as reactive metals form
soluble cations that can be harnessed to do other, more useful, reductions. Electrons are the
simplest possible reducing agents, and they will reduce carbonyl compounds, alkynes, or aromatic rings—in fact any functional group with a low-energy π orbital into which the electron
can go.

###### Birch reduction of arenes

We shall start by looking at the dissolving metal reduction of aromatic rings, known as the
**Birch reduction. The margin shows the reaction of benzene with lithium in liquid ammonia.**
At fi rst sight this reaction looks improbable, with an aromatic ring ending up as an unconjugated diene. The mechanism will explain why we get this regiochemistry, and also why the
reaction stops there—in other words, why the dissolving lithium reduces an aromatic ring
more readily than an alkene.
The fi rst thing to note is that when lithium or sodium dissolve in ammonia they give an
intense blue solution. Blue is the colour of solvated electrons: these group 1 metals ionize to
give Li[+] or Na[+] and e[−](NH3)n. With time, the blue colour fades, as the electrons reduce the
ammonia to NH2− and H2.
Birch reductions use those blue solutions, with their solvated electrons, as reducing agents.
The reduction of NH3 to NH2− and H2 is quite slow, and a better electron acceptor will get
reduced in preference. With benzene, the electrons go into the lowest lying antibonding orbital
(benzene’s LUMO). The species we get can be represented in several ways, all of them radical
anions (molecules with one excess unpaired electron). The radical anion is very basic, and it
picks up a proton from the ethanol that is in the reaction mixture.



- Sodium amide, NaNH2, the
base you met early in this book,
is made by dissolving Na in
liquid NH3 and then waiting till
the solution is no longer blue.

The regiochemistry of the fi nal
product is determined at the last
protonation step—the anion
itself is of course delocalized
and could react at either end to
give a conjugated diene, which
would be more stable. Why then
does it choose to pick up a proton in the middle and give a less
stable isomer? Kinetically controlled reactions of pentadienyl
anions with electrophiles typically take place at this central
carbon as a result of orbital
interactions. For more information see the further reading section at the end of the chapter.


The molecule is now no longer anionic, but it is still a radical. It can pick up another electron, which pairs with the radical to give an anion, which is quenched again by the proton
source (ethanol). Overall we have arrived at two additional H atoms by sequentially adding
two electrons plus two protons.


More questions of regioselectivity arise when there are substituents around the aromatic
ring. Here are two examples.

These examples serve to illustrate a general principle:



**•** **Electron-withdrawing groups promote ipso, para Birch reduction.**

**•** **Electron-donating groups promote ortho, meta Birch reduction.**


The explanation must lie in the distribution of electron density in the intermediate radical
anions. Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize electron density at the ipso and para positions,
and protonation occurs para,

If you want the conjugated dienes as products, it is quite a simple matter to isomerize them
using an acid catalyst. In fact, a small amount (about 20%) of the conjugated product is produced anyway in the reaction of anisole above. With anilines, it is impossible to stop the
isomerization taking place during the reaction, and Birch reduction always gives conjugated
dienamines.

Birch reduction works for alkynes too and reduces them to trans alkenes.

The mechanism follows the same course as the reduction of aromatic rings, but the vinyl
anion is basic enough to deprotonate ammonia, so no added proton source is required. Vinyl
anions are geometrically unstable, and choose to be E. Again, the two green H atoms come
from two electrons and two protons.

###### Selectivity in oxidation reactions

In Chapter 9 you met some chromium-based oxidants that convert primary or secondary alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. We mentioned in that chapter the possibility, when an aldehyde
is the product of the oxidation, that a further oxidation will take place to make a carboxylic
acid. The problem does not arise of course when a secondary alcohol is oxidized to a ketone.

Since then you have met some other oxidizing agents too, particularly in Chapter 19:

 - On p. 429 you saw peracids as oxidizing agents for C=C double bonds—they give
epoxides.

 - On p. 442 you saw osmium tetroxide (OsO4) giving diols from alkenes.

 - On p. 443 we introduced ozone (O3) as a means of cleaving alkenes to carbonyl
compounds by ozonolysis.

Unlike Cr(VI), none of these reagents will oxidize a hydroxyl group: they are chemoselective
for C=C double bonds, but do not react with hydroxyl groups. By contrast, Cr(VI) oxidizes
alcohols but not alkenes.

In this section we will be concerned only with oxidizing agents that oxidize alcohols and
carbonyl compounds, and in particular we shall be concerned with ways of choosing whether
to arrest the oxidation of primary alcohols at the aldehyde stage or let it continue to the
carboxylic acid.
The most commonly used methods for oxidizing alcohols are based around metals in high
oxidation states, often chromium(VI) (which you met in Chapter 9) or manganese(VII), and
you will see that mechanistically they are quite similar—they both rely on the formation of a
bond between the hydroxyl group and the metal. Another class of oxidations, those that use
halogens, sulfur, or nitrogen in high oxidation states, we will deal with relatively briefl y.

###### How to oxidize secondary alcohols to ketones

You met methods for this reaction in Chapter 9, where you met the use of Cr(VI) in the form
of CrO3. One common version of this reaction is the Jones oxidation, shown in the margin. The
mechanism starts with the formation of HCrO4− ions, that is, Cr(VI), from dichromate ion in
solution. In acid, these Cr(VI) species form chromate esters with alcohols. Chromate esters
decompose by elimination of a Cr(IV) species, which subsequently reacts with Cr(VI) to yield
2 × Cr(V). These Cr(V) species can oxidize alcohols in the same way and are thereby reduced
to Cr(III) (the fi nal metal-containing by-product). Cr(VI) is orange and Cr(III) is green, so the
progress of the reaction is easy to follow by colour change.

Chromic acid is best avoided if acid-sensitive alcohols are to be oxidized, and an
alter native reagent for these is PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate), which can be used in
dichloromethane.

###### How to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes

Aqueous methods like the Jones oxidation are no good for this, since the aldehyde that forms
is further oxidized to acid via its hydrate. The oxidizing agent treats the hydrate as an alcohol,
and oxidizes it to the acid.

The key thing is to avoid water, so PCC in dichloromethane works quite well. The related
reagent PDC (pyridinium dichromate) is particularly suitable for oxidation to aldehydes.
Some very mild oxidizing agents are being more and more widely used for the synthesis of
very sensitive aldehydes. One of these is known as TPAP (tetra-n-propylammonium perruthenate, pronounced ‘tee-pap’). TPAP can be used catalytically, avoiding the large amounts of
toxic heavy metal by-products generated by most chromium oxidations. The stoichiometric
oxidant in this reaction is NMO (N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide), which is reduced to the
amine, reoxidizing the ruthenium to Ru(VII).

It will oxidize even very sensitive alcohols to carbonyl compounds—few others, for example, would give the cis-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde in the margin from a cis-allylic alcohol without isomerizing it to trans, or producing other by-products.
We shall leave detailed discussion of one more method till much later, in Chapter 27, since
the mechanism involves some sulfur chemistry you will meet there, but we introduce it here
because of its synthetic importance. Known as the **Swern oxidation, it uses a sulfoxide**

[sulfur(IV)] as the oxidizing agent. The sulfoxide is reduced to a sulfi de, while the alcohol is
oxidized to an aldehyde.

###### How to oxidize primary alcohols or aldehydes to carboxylic acids

Sometimes the ‘over-oxidation’ we were trying to avoid in oxidizing alcohols to aldehydes is
actually the reaction you want. It’s best done with an aqueous solution of Cr(VI) or Mn(VII).
Acidic or basic aqueous potassium permanganate is often a good choice. From alcohols in
acidic solution the mechanism follows very much the lines of the chromic acid mechanism;
from aldehydes, the mechanism is very similar.

###### Competing reactivity: choosing which group reacts

We hope that our survey of the important methods for reduction and oxidation has shown
you that, by choosing the right reagent, you can often get reaction only at the functional
group you want. The chemoselectivity you obtain is kinetic chemoselectivity—reaction at one
functional group is simply faster than at another.
Now look at the acylation of an amino alcohol (which is, in fact, a synthesis of the painkiller
isobucaine) using benzoyl chloride under acid conditions. The hydroxyl group is acylated to
form an ester. Yet under basic conditions, the selectivity is quite different, and an amide is
formed.

We discussed kinetic and thermodynamic control in Chapter 12
(p. 264) and again on
pp. 435 and 505.


The selectivity in these reactions is thermodynamic chemoselectivity. Under conditions in
which the ester and amide can equilibrate, the product obtained is the more stable of the two,
not necessarily the one that is formed faster. In base the more stable amide predominates,
while in acid the amine is protonated, which prevents it from acting as a nucleophile and
removes it from the equilibrium, giving the ester.

###### How to react the less reactive group (I): react both then ‘unreact’ one

The relative reactivity of the alcohol and amine in the example just given could be overturned
by conducting a reaction under thermodynamic control. In kinetically controlled reactions,
the idea that you can conduct chemoselective reactions on the more reactive of a pair of functional groups— carbonyl-based ones, for example—is straightforward. But what if you want
to react the less reactive of the pair? There are two commonly used solutions. The fi rst is illustrated by a compound needed by chemists in Cambridge to study an epoxidation reaction.
They were able to make the following diol, but wanted to acetylate only the more hindered
secondary hydroxyl group.

Treatment with one equivalent of an acetylating agent is no good because the primary
hydroxyl group is more reactive; instead, the chemists acetylated both hydroxyl groups,
and then treated the bis-acetate with mildly basic methanol (K2CO3, MeOH, 20 °C), which
reacted only at the less hindered acetoxy group and gave the desired compound in 65%
yield.

In other words, start by letting both groups react and then go backwards so the reaction is
reversed, but at only one of the two groups. Steric hindrance means that the less favourable
reaction (in other words, reaction at the less reactive group) was also less readily reversed.

###### Chemoselectivity in the reactions of dianions

A similar idea is central to a useful bit of chemoselectivity that can be obtained in the reactions of dianions. 1-Propynol can be deprotonated twice by strong bases—fi rst, at the hydroxyl
group to make an alkoxide anion (the pKa of the OH group is about 16) and, secondly, at the
alkyne (pKa of the order of 25) to make a dianion. When this dianion reacts with electrophiles
it always reacts at the alkynyl anion and not at the alkoxide.

Although anions can often be formed straightforwardly next to alkynes, there are two other
more acidic protons (black) in the molecule that would be removed by base before the green
proton. However, treatment with three equivalents of butyl lithium removes all three, and the
trianion reacts with ethylene oxide at the last-formed anionic centre to give the required
compound.

###### How to react the less reactive group (II): protecting groups

The more usual way of reacting a less reactive group in the presence of a more reactive one is
to use a protecting group. This tertiary alcohol, for example, could be made from a keto-ester
if we could get phenylmagnesium bromide to react with the ester rather than with the ketone.

One way of making the alcohol we want is to protect the ketone from attack by disguising it
from the nucleophile. An acetal protecting group (shown in black) is used.



- Five-membered cyclic acetals
like these are known as
dioxolanes. You met them fi rst
in Chapter 11 when we were
discussing acetal formation and
hydrolysis.


The fi rst step puts the protecting group on to the (more electrophilic) ketone carbonyl, making it no longer reactive towards nucleophilic addition. The Grignard then adds to the ester,
and fi nally a ‘deprotection’ step, acid-catalysed hydrolysis of the acetal, gives us back the
ketone. An acetal is an ideal choice here—acetals are stable to base (the conditions of the reaction we want to do), but are readily cleaved in acid.

###### A survey of protecting groups

A dioxolane can be used in this way to protect aldehydes and ketones from powerful, basic
nucleophiles, and makes the fi rst entry in the tour of important protecting groups we shall
conduct you through in the next few pages.

By protecting sensitive functional groups like ketones it becomes possible to make reagents that would otherwise be unstable. In a synthesis of the natural product porantherine,
a compound based on the structure in the margin was needed. As it’s a symmetrical secondary alcohol (see p. 216), a good way to make it is to add a Grignard reagent twice to ethyl
formate.

But, of course, a ketone-containing Grignard is an impossibility as it would self-destruct, so

Strongly nucleophilic reagents like Grignard reagents and organolithiums are also strong
bases and may need protecting from acidic protons as well as from electrophilic carbonyl
groups. Among the most troublesome are the protons of hydroxyl groups. When some
American chemists wanted to make the antiviral agent Brefeldin A, they needed the simple
alkynol in the margin.
A synthesis could start with the same bromoketone as the one above: reduction gives an
alcohol, but alkylation of an alkynyl anion with this compound is not possible because the
anion will just deprotonate the hydroxyl group.

The answer is to protect the hydroxyl group with a group resistant to base, and the group
chosen here was a silyl ether. Such ethers are made by reacting the alcohol with a trialkylsilyl
chloride (here tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, or TBDMSCl) in the presence of a weak base,
usually imidazole, which also acts as a nucleophilic catalyst (Chapter 12).

Silicon has a strong affi nity for electronegative elements, particularly O, F, and Cl, so trialkylsilyl ethers are attacked by hydroxide ion, water, or fl uoride ion but are more stable to
carbon or nitrogen bases or nucleophiles. They are usually removed with aqueous acid or fl uoride salts, particularly Bu4N[+]F[−] (tetra-n-butylammonium fl uoride, known as TBAF and pronounced ‘tea-baff’), which is soluble in organic solvents. In fact, TBDMS is one member of a
whole family of trialkylsilyl protecting groups and their relative stability to nucleophiles of
various kinds is determined by the three alkyl groups carried by silicon. The most labile, trimethylsilyl (TMS), is removed simply on treatment with methanol, while the most stable
require hydrofl uoric acid.



- Although not important to
our discussion here, these
substitution reactions are not
the simple SN2 reactions
(Chapter 15) they might appear
to be. The nucleophile adds to
silicon fi rst to form a fi ve-valent
anion, which decomposes with
the loss of the alcohol.

Why can’t we just use a simple alkyl ether (methyl, say) to protect a hydroxyl group? There
is no problem making the ether, and it will survive most reactions—but there is a problem
getting an ether off again. This is always a consideration in protecting group chemistry—
you want a group that is stable to the conditions of whatever reaction you are going to do
(in these examples, strong bases and nucleophiles), but can then be removed under mild
conditions that do not result in decomposition of a sensitive molecule. What we need then
is an ether that has an Achilles’ heel—a feature that makes it susceptible to attack by some
specifi c reagent or under specifi c conditions. One such group is the tetra hydropyranyl
(THP) group. Although it is stable under basic conditions, as an ether would be, it is an
acetal—the presence of the second oxygen atom is its Achilles’ heel and makes the THP
protecting group susceptible to hydrolysis under acidic conditions. You could see the lone
pair on the second oxygen atom as a safety catch that is released only in the presence of acid.

Making the THP acetal has to be done in an unfamiliar way because the usual ‘carbonyl plus

them with an enol ether, dihydropyran, under acid catalysis. Notice the oxonium intermediate (formed by a familiar mechanism from Chapter 12)—just as in a normal acetal-forming
reaction. In this example the THP group is at work preventing a hydroxyl group from interfering in the reduction of an ester.

A little further inspection will
show you that the THP group
here is not just stopping the OH
interfering with the LiAlH4 reduction, but is also crucial to the
preservation of the chirality of
this compound. The wedged
bond shows you that the starting
material is a single enantiomer:
without a protecting group on
one of the hydroxyls, they would
be identical and the compound
would no longer be chiral. The
THP group also complicates the
situation by introducing an extra
chiral centre, and hence the
potential for two diastereoisomers, which we will ignore.

The THP-protected compound above was used as an intermediate in a synthesis of the
insect icide milbemycin. It needed to be converted to the alkyne in the margin—to do this the
_other hydroxyl group also needed protecting._
This time, however, TBDMS will not do because the protecting group needs to withstand
the acidic conditions needed to remove the THP protecting group! What is more, the protecting group needs to be able to survive acid conditions in later steps of the synthesis of the
insecticide. The answer is to use a third type of hydroxyl-protecting group, a benzyl ether.
Benzyl (Bn) protecting groups are put on using strong base (usually sodium hydride) plus
benzyl bromide, and are stable to both acid and base.

The benzyl ether’s Achilles’ heel is the aromatic ring and, after reading the fi rst half of this
chapter, you should be able to suggest conditions that will take it off again: hydrogenation
(hydrogenolysis) over a palladium catalyst, which cleaves benzylic C–O bonds.

Benzyl ethers can alternatively sometimes be removed by acid, if the acid has a nucleophilic

nucleophile to displace ROH, although only at the reactive, benzylic centre.

- Alternatives to HBr include
BBr3, usually the favoured
reagent, HI, and Me3SiI.


We said earlier that simple methyl ethers are inappropriate as protecting groups for OH
because they are too hard to take off again. That is usually true, but not if the OH is phenolic—
ArOH is a better leaving group than ROH, so HBr will take off methyl groups from aryl methyl
ethers too.

Protecting groups may be useful, but they are also wasteful—both of time, because there
are two extra steps to do (putting the group on and taking it off), and of material, because
these steps may not go in 100% yield. Here’s one way to avoid using them. During the
development of the anti-asthma drug salbutamol, the triol below was needed. With large
quantities of salbutamol already available, it seemed most straightforward to make the triol
by adding phenylmagnesium bromide to an ester available from salbutamol. Unfortunately,
the ester also contains three acidic protons, making it look as though the hydroxyl and
amine groups all need protecting. But, in fact, it was possible to do the reaction just by adding a large excess of Grignard reagent: enough to remove the acidic protons and to add to
the ester.

This strategy is easy to try, and, providing the Grignard reagent isn’t valuable (you can buy
PhMgBr in bottles), is much more economical than putting on protecting groups and taking
them off again. But it doesn’t always work—there is no way of telling whether it will until you
try the reaction in the laboratory. In this closely related reaction, for example, the same chemists found that they needed to protect both the phenolic hydroxyl group (but not the other
alcohol OH) as a benzyl ether and the amine NH as a benzyl amine. Both protecting groups
come off in one hydrogenation step.

Benzyl groups are one way of protecting secondary amines against strong bases that might

nowhere more acute than in the synthesis of one of the most important classes of biological
molecules: peptides.

###### Peptide synthesis

Peptide synthesis has become one of the most reliable and predictable fi elds of practical
organic chemistry, principally because of the effectiveness of the protecting groups it employs.
For this reason, peptides are one of the few classes of complex organic molecules that can
routinely be made by machines, such as the one on the right, in which much of the chemistry
we are about to talk about takes place without any human intervention.
Biology makes peptides and proteins by selectively coupling together members of a pool of
20 or so amino acids. To do the same in the laboratory, we need to overcome a number of challenges. For example, we’ll start by thinking about how to react two amino acids together, to
make a dipeptide—leucine and glycine, for example. If we want the NH2 group of glycine to
react with the CO2H group of leucine we will fi rst have to activate the carboxylic acid towards
nucleophilic substitution—by making the acyl chloride, say, or a particularly reactive ester,
which we will represent as RCOX.



- There is a full list of the
names, structures, and
abbreviation of the amino acids
which constitute most peptides
and proteins on p. 554.

The main problem, though, is that there is another free CO2H, which could react with the unwanted by-products

giving both LeuLeu (which we don’t want) and LeuGly (which we do).
For this reason, we need to protect both the NH2 group of leucine and the
CO2H group of glycine. What sort of protecting groups do they need to be? unprotected coupling—

We will need to be able to take them off again once they have done their job,

A good choice for a pair of conditions might be acid and base—we might protect the NH2
group with a protecting group we can remove only in base, and the CO2H group with protection we can remove only in acid.

###### The Cbz protecting group—oxytocin

**H2N–Cys-Tyr-Ile-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Leu-Gly–CONH2**

oxytocin

We introduced the dipeptide LeuGly as an example because it appears at one end of the peptide
hormone oxytocin. The fi rst step in the synthesis of oxytocin is indeed the coupling of glycine
(through its amino group) with leucine. This is how it was done by du Vigneaud and Bodanszky.
First, the carboxylic acid of the glycine was protected as an ethyl ester. Making an ester is the
obvious way to stop CO2H groups interfering as acids or as nucleophiles. However, simple methyl
and ethyl esters may pose problems—they can still react with such nucleophiles as amines. Ethyl
esters of amino acids are therefore stable only if the NH2 group is protected. The glycine ethyl
ester had to be stored as its hydrochloride salt: in effect, the –NH2 group is ‘protected’ as –NH3+.


Oxytocin is a hormone involved
in controlling the onset of
labour in women and the subsequent release of milk. It was the
fi rst peptide hormone to be
synthesized, in 1953, by du
Vigneaud, who won the Nobel
prize in 1955 for his work on
peptide synthesis. The ‘synthetic’
version of the hormone, syntocinon (identical, of course, with
the natural version isolated from
human placentas, although
without the dangers of biological contamination), is regularly
used in modern obstetrics to
induce labour in women whose
babies are overdue.

- This method is preferable in
this case to the usual way of
making esters, from acyl
chloride plus alcohol (see
Chapter 10), because steric
hindrance makes that a very
slow reaction with t-butanol.


A more commonly used carboxylic-acid-protecting group that is rather more stable towards
attack by nucleophiles is the **t-butyl ester. t-Butyl esters can be made by reacting the carbox-**
ylic acid with the cation generated from isobutene in sulfuric acid.

Steric bulk means that _t-butyl esters are resistant to nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl_
group, and that includes hydrolysis under basic conditions (nucleophilic attack by HO[−]). But
they do hydrolyse relatively easily in acid because the mechanism of hydrolysis of t-butyl
esters in acid is quite different. Instead of undergoing nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl
group, the t-butyl ester loses a stable carbocation, which is either captured by solvent in an SN1
reaction or loses a proton in an E1 reaction.

In the event, the chemists needed a group that they could later react with ammonia to make
the primary amide that is present in oxytocin. They also wanted a group that was stable to
mild acid—so they chose the ethyl ester.
As for the leucine residue, it had to have its NH2 group protected using a base-stable protecting group because base would be needed to release the NH2 group of the glycine hydrochloride salt. The group that was used is one of the most important nitrogen-protecting groups
and is known as the Cbz group (Cbz stands for carboxybenzyl). Cbz groups are put on by
treating with benzyl chloroformate (BnOCOCl) and weak base.

Cbz-protected amines are actually carbamates: just like amides they are no longer nucleophilic because the nitrogen’s lone pair is tied up in conjugation with the carbonyl group. They
are resistant to both aqueous acid and aqueous base, but they have, to use the analogy we
developed earlier, an Achilles’ heel—the benzyl group. Removal of the benzyl group under
the same two sets of conditions that remove benzyl ethers (p. 551) releases the safety catch
and removes Cbz:

The carboxylic acid of the Cbz-protected leucine next has to be activated to allow it to react
with the glycine. The acyl chloride won’t do as it is unstable, and an alternative in peptide
chemistry is to make a _p-nitrophenyl or 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl ester. Phenoxide, especially_
when substituted with electron-withdrawing substituents, is a good leaving group, and Cbzleucine p-nitrophenyl ester reacts with the glycine hydrochloride ethyl ester in the presence
of a weak base (triethylamine, to release the glycine’s NH2 group).

- The lower pKa of a phenol
makes a phenoxide a better
leaving group than an alkoxide,
and an electron-defi cient
phenoxide is even better still
(see p. 173).



- Notice the chemoselectivity
in this step—the glycine’s NH2
group has three carbonyl groups
to choose from, but reacts only
with the most electrophilic—the
one bearing the best leaving
group.

The dipeptide is now coupled—but is still protected. Deprotection (HBr/AcOH) gave the HCl
salt of LeuGly ethyl ester for further reaction. The rest of the peptide was built up in much the
same way—each amino acid being introduced as the Cbz-protected p-nitrophenyl ester before
being deprotected ready for the next coupling, until all nine of oxytocin’s amino acids had
been introduced.

###### The Boc protecting group—gastrin and aspartame

Gastrin is a hormone released from the stomach that controls the progress of digestion. Early
work on the hormone showed that only the four C-terminal amino acids of the peptide (the
C-terminal tetrapeptide) were necessary for its physiological activity.
The synthesis starts with the coupling of two more amino acids: aspartic acid and phenylalanine. As you would expect, the carboxylic acid group of phenylalanine is protected, this
time as a methyl ester, and the NH2 group of aspartic acid is protected as a Cbz derivative.
Since aspartic acid has two carboxylic acid groups, one of these also has to be protected. Here
is the method—fi rst the Cbz group is put on; then both acids are protected as benzyl esters.
Then just one of the benzyl esters is hydrolysed. It may seem surprising to you that this
chemoselective hydrolysis is possible, and you could not have predicted that it would work
without trying it out in the laboratory.

###### Accidental aspartame

At this point in one synthesis of
the tetrapeptide in the laboratories of Searle, the now defunct
American pharmaceutical company, a remarkable discovery
occurred. The AspPhe methyl
ester was accidentally found to
taste sweet: extremely sweet—
about 200 times as sweet as
sucrose. AspPhe is now known
as aspartame, marketed under
the brand name NutraSweet. It
goes without saying that despite
this extraordinary discovery,
tasting anything in the laboratory, accidentally or otherwise, is
extremely unwise, ill-judged, and
outright dangerous. Donald
Rumsfeld was once chief executive of Searle.


The protected acid is next activated as its 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl ester, ready for coupling
with the phenylalanine methyl ester in base. Now you see why the benzyl ester was chosen to
protect Asp’s side-chain carboxylic acid group—hydrogenolysis can be used to cleave both the
Cbz group and the benzyl ester at the same time.

The next amino acid in the peptide is methionine, and it will of course need N-protecting
and C-activating. The N-protecting group used this time was different—still a carbamate,
although not Cbz— it was Boc, which stands for t-butyloxycarbonyl and is pronounced ‘bock’.
The Boc group, t-BuOCO, is introduced with (t-BuOCO)2O, known as Boc anhydride.

using a good nucleophile, Br [−],
because an SN2 step is involved;
any old acid will cleave Boc.


Like Cbz, the Boc group is a carbamate protecting group. But, unlike Cbz, it can be removed
simply with dilute aqueous acid. Just 3M HCl will hydrolyse it, again by protonation, loss of
_t-butyl cation, and decarboxylation. Base, on the other hand, cannot touch the Boc group—_
the carbonyl group is too hindered to be attacked even by OH[−], and Boc is strongly resistant
to basic hydrolysis.

Meanwhile, back at the tetrapeptide synthesis, methionine (Met) has been Boc-protected,
and is ready for activation—as a 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl ester (abbreviated to Ar below) this
time—and coupling with the deprotected AspPhe–OMe. Aqueous acid takes off the Boc group
without hydrolysing peptide or ester bonds, and a repeat of this cycle with Boc-tryptophan
trichlorophenyl ester (BocHN–Trp–OAr) followed by formation of the amide with ammonia

###### The Fmoc protecting group

Our fi nal protecting group has a susceptibility inverse to that of Boc. The Fmoc (pronounced
‘eff-mock’), or fl uorenylmethyloxycarbonyl, protecting group cannot be lost by substitution
in the manner of Cbz or t-Boc because neither SN1 nor SN2 mechanisms can operate at the
ringed carbon atom: it is both primary and hindered.

So, where is the safety catch? Fmoc’s Achilles’ heel is its rather acidic proton (pKa about 25),
shown in green. It’s acidic because the anionic product of deprotonation is aromatic. Only a
very small concentration of this aromatic anion ever forms, but as it does it immediately
undergoes elimination. Fmoc-protected amines are readily deprotected in base.


In Chapter 15 we analysed in
detail the structural features which
favour and disfavour substitution
reactions of this type.

###### Introduction

We met chemoselectivity—which group reacts—in the last chapter. Chemoselectivity means
that there are two separate functional groups and that a reagent must choose between them.
By contrast, regioselectivity implies that there is one functional group that can react in two
different places and a reagent must choose where to react. Simple examples include addition
of HX to an alkene (Chapter 19) and nucleophilic attack on the epoxide derived from that
alkene (Chapter 15).

**HX** **O** **Nu**

It might also mean that two functional groups are combined in a single conjugated system
that can again react in two (or more) places. Examples include the addition of bromine to
dienes (two conjugated alkenes) and addition of a nucleophile to a conjugated carbonyl compound (carbonyl group conjugated to an alkene).

The choice between _ortho/para and_ _meta substitution when an electrophile attacks a_
benzene ring (Chapter 21) is also a matter of regioselectivity. We shall discuss all these
examples in further detail in this chapter, and extend these ideas to new reactions as well.

###### Regioselectivity in electrophilic aromatic substitution

We start with electrophilic aromatic substitution. It was established in Chapter 21 that an
electron-donating substituent favours _ortho/para and an electron-withdrawing substituent_
favours meta substitution. Although meta substitution is usually slower than ortho/para substitution (because electron-withdrawing groups deactivate the ring), it usually gives the _meta_
product alone.

_meta product only_


Most reactions of benzene rings with electron-donating substituents give ortho/para mixtures and, if the substituent is very electron-donating, may lead to both ortho and para substitution in the same molecule. Control in favour of the para product can usually be achieved by
reducing the reactivity of the substituent and increasing its size.

Of course, if the para position is blocked, ortho substitution is the only option, and we will
come back to the idea of blocking substituents shortly. But there is a general way of directing
electrophiles to the ortho position using activation by metallation.

###### Making organometallics by deprotonating aromatic rings: ortholithiation

Look at the reaction below: butyllithium deprotonates an sp[2] hybridized carbon atom to give
an aryllithium. It works because the protons attached to sp[2] carbons are more acidic than
protons attached to sp[3] carbons (although they are a lot less acidic than alkyne protons).


**MeO**

But there must be another factor involved to account for exclusive _ortho substitution,_
which is after all the most hindered site. The functional group containing oxygen (sometimes nitrogen) is next to the proton to be removed. This functional group ‘guides’ the butyllithium, so that it attacks the adjacent protons. It does this by forming a complex with the
Lewis acidic lithium atom, much as ether solvents dissolve Grignard reagents by complexing


-----

their Lewis-acidic metal ions. This mechanism means that it is only the protons ortho to the
functional group that can be removed, and the reaction is known as an ortholithiation.

The example below shows ortholithiation, activated by the nitrogen atom of a tertiary

- Compare the methods for
making organolithiums or
Grignard reagents that you met
in Chapter 9—most of them rely
on formation of an
organometallic by reduction of
an alkyl or aryl halide.


73% yield

Ortholithiation is a useful way of making reactive organometallics because the starting
material does not need to contain a halogen atom. But it is much less general than the other
ways we have told you about for making organolithiums, as there are rather tight restrictions
on what sorts of groups the aromatic ring must carry. The best ortholithiation-directing substituents have lone pairs to donate electrons to Li and are also electronegative so they withdraw
electrons from the benzene ring and help stabilize the anion forming at the ortho position.


-----

###### Sulfonation may lead to ortho selectivity without lithiation

We introduced sulfonation in Chapter 21 but have left detailed discussion until now because
sulfonation has some features that make it more interesting than fi rst meets the eye. One
important difference between sulfonation and other examples of electrophilic substitution is
that sulfonation is reversible. Heating an arenesulfonic acid causes it to decompose with loss of
gaseous SO3.
Here’s an example of how we can exploit this to gain control of regioselectivity without
resorting to lithiation. In stage 1 the phenol is sulfonated twice—the fi rst sulfonic acid group
(which adds para to the OH group) is electron-withdrawing and deactivates the ring, making
the introduction of the second group (which goes ortho to the OH and meta to the fi rst sulfonic acid) harder and that of the third group harder still, which is why we can isolate the
disulfonated phenol.

In the second stage, the bromination, the OH directs to the ortho and para positions, but
only one ortho position is vacant, so the bromine attacks there. Sodium hydroxide is needed
to deprotonate the sulfonic acid groups to make them less deactivating. The sulfonation reaction is reversible, and in the third stage it is possible to drive the reaction over to the products
by distilling out the relatively volatile 2-bromophenol at high temperature. The loss of SO3
involves attack of H[+] on the aromatic ring.

Overall, we have succeeded in making 2-bromophenol where direct bromination of phenol
itself would have given (at low temperatures) mainly p-bromophenol and at higher temperatures, 2,4,6-tribromophenol. The sulfonic acid groups are useful reversible blocking groups.
The same method can be used with anilines because para-sulfonation of aromatic amines
is possible. This seems surprising because in sulfuric acid essentially all the amine will be
proton ated. You might expect the resulting ammonium ion to react in the _meta position_
(because NH3+ is no longer electron-rich) but instead the para-sulfonic acid (sulfanilic acid) is
formed. At the high temperature of the reaction, it is probable that any meta-substituted product reverts to the starting material, while the para-sulfonic acid accumulates because it is stabilized by delocalization and is less hindered.

**SO2OH**


###### The sulfonating agent

The exact nature of the electrophile in sulfonation reactions
seems to vary with the amount
of water present. Certainly for
oleum (fuming sulfuric acid, that
is concentrated sulfuric acid with
added sulfur trioxide) and solutions of sulfur trioxide in organic
solvents, the electrophile is sulfur trioxide itself, SO3. With more
water around, H3SO4+ [and even ]
H2S2O7 have been suggested.



- You might want to consider
why sulfonation is reversible at
high temperature in the light of
our discussion of entropy and
temperature on p. 248.



- The reversibility of
sulfonation with sulfuric acid
may also account for the higher
yield of para product in the
sulfonation of toluene with
H2SO4 as compared with
ClSO2OH (p. 485).

###### Regioselective reactions of naphthalene

We introduced you to the 10-electron aromatic system of naphthalene in Chapter 7. As you
would expect, it undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution with the same reagents you met
in Chapter 21, but the regioselectivity of its reactions is of a different type to the ortho, meta,


-----

_para selectivity we have been talking about. Naphthalene has 10 carbons: two form the ring_
junction, and aren’t available for substitution reactions, and the other eight are of just two
types α (the 1-position, next to the ring junction) and β (the 2-position).
Electrophilic substitution on naphthalene normally occurs at a site next to the ring junction (α). This is because the HOMO has its largest coeffi cient at this atom, but you can rationalize the result by looking at the long, linear delocalization in the resulting cation, which can
be represented by a single train of arrows. This extended conjugation makes naphthalene
more nucleophilic than benzene. So, bromination occurs at the α-position in good yield even
without a Lewis acid.


**E** **H** **E** **H** **E**


**E**


Unactivated rings such as
benzene need a Lewis acid to react
with bromine: see p. 474.


**–H**

Reaction at the other position (β) is less favourable as the intermediate cation is crossconjugated. The cation delocalizes into both rings, but no long linear chain of arrows is
possible.


**E**


**H**


**H**


**E** **–H** **E**



- Another way of looking at
the difference between these
two delocalized cations is that
the fi rst can be shown
delocalized into the double bond
without disrupting the remaining
aromatic ring; in the second, all
other representations of
delocalized structures must lose
the aromatic ring.


If the reaction is irreversible, the α-product is usually formed. But if the reaction is reversible,
as is the case with sulfonation, the position of substitution may be determined by temperature.
Sulfonation at low temperatures gives the α-product by kinetic control, while sulfonation at
high temperatures gives the β-product by thermodynamic control. The β-product is formed
more slowly but it is more stable as there is less steric hindrance between the large sulfonic acid
group and the orange hydrogen on the other ring. Under conditions allowing reversible
sulfonation, eventually all the product ends up β.

###### Regiocontrol by choice of route

Choosing the right route to an aromatic product is essential if you want to get one particular
isomer. We can illustrate this with the synthesis of the isomers of bromonitrobenzene.
Because the bromo substituent is ortho, para-directing and the nitro group meta-directing, it’s
possible to make all three isomers, providing we exploit the regioselectivity of electrophilic
substitution. Nitration of bromobenzene would give the ortho and para isomers while bromination of nitrobenzene would give the meta isomer. The selectivity of the fi rst reaction is not
good: bromine is small and not very electronegative, so steric hindrance is weak and the ortho
positions are not deactivated. Furthermore there are two ortho positions but only one para: a
typical result is about 37% ortho, 1% meta, and 62% para. Both compounds are industrial products, made by nitration and separated.

Before we move on, consider why this selectivity works: we can get all three isomers because
we have one _ortho/para director and one_ _meta director. But what if we had two_ _ortho/para_
directors—say, amino and bromo—and wanted the meta isomer?


**NH2**

Since the amino group can be substituted by diazotization (p. 520), many problems of regioselectivity can be solved by using nitro compounds as intermediates. You could, for example,
use the product above to make the otherwise challenging 3-bromoiodobenzene:

###### Regioselectivity in nucleophilic aromatic substitution

As you saw in Chapters 21 and 22, diazonium salts need no activation to undergo nucleophilic
aromatic substitution, but for other leaving groups a nitro group is commonly used as an
activator. The three fl uoronitrobenzenes are all commercial products but only the ortho and
_para isomers can do the nucleophilic substitution. This is because the nitro group must be able_
to stabilize the addition intermediate by accepting the negative charge.

By carefully combining electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution it is possible to make
aromatic compounds with substituents arranged in a precise and predictable fashion. So, if
we nitrate o-dichlorobenzene, all positions are favourable but the nitro group goes in para to
one Cl atom because of steric hindrance at the ortho positions. Although chlorine is small,
two chlorines next to each other have a butressing effect as each pushes the other away. It is
diffi cult to get three adjacent substituents on a benzene ring. If we now do a nucleophilic

aromatic substitution, only the Cl para to the nitro group is displaced. We can even reduce
the nitro group to the corresponding amine.

###### Regioselectivity of intramolecular reactions


**N2**


**CN**


A cunning way to get unusual regioselectivity is to make the reaction intramolecular. The
synthesis from benzene of the cyclic ketone known as tetralone may look diffi cult as we must
get an ortho relationship on the benzene ring. But if we make the fi nal bond in the ring by a
Friedel–Crafts acylation there is no problem. The alkyl group is ortho,para-directing and the
acid cannot reach the para position.

**HCl**



- Usually a more powerful
catalyst (AlCl3) is needed, but
intramolecular acylations are
fast enough without this.


Notice the use of a cyclic anhydride in the fi rst Friedel–Crafts acylation. It doesn’t matter
where the acylation occurs and the reaction stops there as the ring is deactivated by the
ketone and the carboxylic acid released in the reaction is much less electrophilic than the
anhydride. The ketone is then reduced to a CH2 group by the Clemmensen method (see
Chapter 23) and polyphosphoric acid is used to carry out the intramolecular acylation step.
A more subtle approach is to use a ‘tether’—something that holds two reagents together and
is afterwards cleaved. An example is halolactonization. The idea is simple. A halogen, say
bromine, attacks an alkene and the bromonium ion intermediate is captured intramolecularly by the anion of a carboxylic acid. The reaction therefore uses bromine and NaHCO3—a
weak base, but one strong enough to deprotonate a carboxylic acid. The anion attacks the
more highly substituted end of the bromonium ion, as explained in Chapter 19, and forms a
fi ve-membered ring.

Although any halogen might be used in this reaction, iodine is the most versatile and the

this can be cleaved with an alkoxide.

The reaction with methoxide needs some explanation. Attack on the carbonyl group cleaves
the lactone, releasing an alkoxide that cyclizes to form an epoxide. A second molecule of
methoxide now attacks the epoxide, opening it from the less hindered end as we should
expect in an anionic reaction (Chapter 19).

Another example shows that reaction may occur at the other end of the iodonium ion.
Attack at the tertiary carbon would be diffi cult sterically and, in any case, would give an
unstable four-membered ring. The lactone formed has the iodine β to the carbonyl group and
so eliminates easily in base (pyridine works well) by the E1cB mechanism (Chapter 17) to give
the unsaturated lactone. Although the relative stereochemistry of the iodolactone is controlled by the inversion in the opening of the iodonium ion, it is irrelevant as it disappears in
the elimination step.

###### Regioselectivity in elimination reactions

This question was discussed in Chapter 17 but we can return to it here with more sophisticated examples. The regioselectivity in the last reaction of the sequence above dictates the
position of the alkene in the product. Of all of the protons adjacent to the iodo group, only a
black one is lost:

The orange hydrogen cannot be lost by E2 as it is cis to the iodine and E2 reactions prefer a
_trans (anti-periplanar) arrangement. The green hydrogens are not lost because they are less_
acidic than the black hydrogens. In fact, this is not an E2 elimination at all. Because one of the
black hydrogens can be lost in enolate formation, this is an E1cB elimination.

But now another regioselectivity question arises: if elimination occurs preferably towards
the carbonyl group, how can we make the starting material for the iodolactonization sequence,
which has the alkene not in conjugation with the carboxylic acid? It turns out that it is better
to make the ester with the ‘wrong’ regioselectivity. This is easily done by a Horner–Wadsworth–
Emmons reaction using a phosphonate ester. This Wittig-style reaction is explained in
Chapter 27.

Now comes the remarkable regioselectivity. The ester is hydrolysed, as usual, in aqueous
NaOH. On acidifi cation to pH 3, the free acid is released and the double bond has moved into
the ring.

Alkenes like to be conjugated with carbonyl groups but they also prefer to be _inside six-_
membered rings rather than outside—in this case presumably because the ester group otherwise has to eclipse a ring carbon. Conjugation with an ester group pulls the alkene out of the
six-membered ring in the lactone we made above, but when the carbonyl group is a carboxylate anion, conjugation is very weak and the double bond moves into the ring.

###### Electrophilic attack on alkenes

You met electrophilic attack on alkenes in Chapter 19 and we shall just briefl y revisit its
regioselectivity. Unsymmetrical alkenes add HBr to give the more stable of the two possible
cations. If R is alkyl or aryl, this means the more substituted cation.

If you want to get the other regioisomer, with the heteroatom at the end, you can use hydroboration (Chapter 19) or the radical reactions described in the next section. Here is a brief
reminder of hydroboration. Reaction between a borane having at least one B–H bond with an
alkene gives an alkyl borane in which all the hydrogens are replaced by alkyl groups. Oxidation
gives the terminal alcohol.

The regioselectivity comes from the fi rst step. The boron’s empty p orbital bonds to the more

Borane is unstable but can easily be made from NaBH4 and BF3. In this synthesis of hexan1-ol from hex-1-ene, a water molecule has been added to the alkene, but with the opposite

Almost every reaction we have discussed so far has been ionic, but in this short section we
need to give you a preview of another group of reactions we return to in Chapter 37—those of
_radicals. When HBr adds to an unsymmetrical alkene we use arrows that represent the move-_
ment of two electrons to give charged intermediates that combine in a second step to give a
neutral product. The strong H–Br bond breaks to give a bromide ion and a stable alkyl cation.
This bond breaks heterolytically—that is, unsymmetrically—as does the alkene bond. We can
predict the regiochemistry of these reactions by making the most stable anions and cations as
intermediates, in this case a tertiary alkyl cation and a bromide anion.

The regioselectivity in the reaction below is opposite: a primary alkyl bromide is formed, by a

In radical reactions, bonds break homolytically with one electron going one way and one the
other. The radicals that are formed have an odd number of electrons, one of which must be
unpaired. This makes them very reactive and they are not usually isolated. Even strong bonds
can break into ions provided they are polarized, but to make radicals we need weak symmetrical bonds such as O–O, Br–Br or I–I. Dibenzoyl peroxide, the Ph(CO2)2 catalyst in this reaction, readily undergoes homolysis like this—the one-electron movements are represented by
‘fi sh-hook’ arrows having one barb and odd electrons on atoms are represented by dots.

Now we can use the new radicals we have just made to cleave the strong HBr bond homolytically because a new and very strong OH bond will be formed. As we start with one radical
intermediate that must have an unpaired electron, we must fi nish with another radical with
an unpaired electron. In this case, it is a bromine radical.

If we do this reaction in the presence of the alkene we have just reacted with HBr, the bromine radical adds to the alkene in one of the two possible ways. Although radicals are neutral,


-----

they are electron-defi cient (the C atom is one electron short) and, rather like cations, are more
stable the more substituents they have. So the tertiary radical is formed rather than the primary radical, and the bromine ends up at the primary position.

We have still not reached the end of the reaction as our product is still a radical. How can it
become a molecule with only paired electrons? The answer is simple. It reacts with another
HBr molecule to produce more bromine radicals. Now you see something important to all
radical reactions: only a small amount of the radical is needed as more radicals are produced
every time the reaction gives product. The overall process is a radical chain reaction.

Because of this we also need only very small amounts of dibenzoyl peroxide, the radical

We sneaked a new reaction into that sequence. The removal of a hydrogen atom (note: not a
proton) from HBr by the peroxide radical is an abstraction reaction. The bromine radical will
also abstract hydrogen atoms and will do so from the same alkene we have just used but with
yet another different outcome, as you see in the margin.
When light shines on bromine, the weak Br–Br bond breaks to give two bromine radicals.
Heat will do the job too but light is cleaner and, as bromine is brown, it absorbs most wavelengths of visible light.

Radicals are very unstable and reactive, and these bromine radicals may simply recombine or they may react with other compounds. You already know that bromide anions are
good nucleophiles in SN2 reactions, but bromine radicals do two quite different reactions:
abstraction and addition. The Br radical may abstract a hydrogen atom from the alkene or
it may add to the π bond. Notice that each reaction produces a new carbon-centred radical
and, in the fi rst case, a molecule of HBr. Whereas the Br–Br bond is weak, the H–Br bond is
much stronger (366 kJ mol[−][1]) and, unlike ionic reactions, radical reactions are dominated
by bond strength.

more stable than the O–O bond
in the peroxide.

Removal of an alkene H gives a carbon-centred radical localized on the sp[2] atom but the
removal of an H from a methyl group gives a much more stable delocalized allylic radical. In
addition there are six such H atoms but only two alkene H atoms.
The reaction obviously cannot end there with the formation of another radical, however
stable, and this allylic radical collects a bromine atom from a bromine molecule. Note that
the allylic radical doesn’t react with a bromine radical in this step: radicals are very un stable
and the concentration of radicals at any one time is so low that it is rare for two of them to
meet.

This step also produces a new bromine radical that can start a new series of reactions. Like
the addition of HBr above, the reaction is a radical chain reaction, and only a small amount
of Br2 needs to break down to Br[•] to get the reaction going. This is important as you already
know what happens when bromine molecules react with alkenes: addition occurs by an ionic
mechanism. Add too much Br2 and the bromine molecules attack the alkene directly and do
not abstract H atoms.

If we want to make the dibromide, we use plenty of bromine, but if we want to use a radical
process to make the allylic bromide we must take advantage of the greater reactivity of the
radical and keep the bromine concentration low. A good way to do this is to use the compound
NBS (N-bromosuccinimide), which you met in Chapter 19. NBS acts as a sort of turnstile
which only lets a molecule of Br2 out when a molecule of HBr is formed (and of course HBr is
the by-product in the radical bromination).

###### Nucleophilic attack on allylic compounds

The allylic bromides that can be made by these radical reactions display interesting regioselectivity. We shall start with some substitution reactions with which you are familiar from
Chapter 15. There we said that allyl bromide is about 100 times more reactive towards simple
SN2 reactions than is propyl bromide or other saturated alkyl halides.
The double bond stabilizes the SN2 transition state by conjugation with the p orbital at the
carbon atom under attack. This full p orbital (shown in orange in the diagram below) forms a
partial bond with the nucleophile and with the leaving group in the transition state. Any
stabilization of the transition state will, of course, accelerate the reaction by lowering the
energy barrier.

There is an alternative mechanism for this reaction that involves nucleophilic attack on the
alkene instead of on the saturated carbon atom. This mechanism leads to the same product
and is often called the SN2' (pronounced ‘S-N-two-prime’) mechanism.

We can explain both mechanisms in a unifi ed way if we look at the frontier orbitals involved.
The nucleophile must attack an empty orbital (the LUMO), which we might expect to be simply σ* (C–Br) for the SN2 reaction. But this ignores the alkene. The interaction between π*
(C=C) and the adjacent σ* (C–Br) will as usual produce two new orbitals, one higher and one
lower in energy. The lower-energy orbital, π* + σ*, will now be the LUMO. To construct this
orbital we must put all the atomic orbitals parallel and make the contact between π* + σ* a
bonding interaction.

If the allylic halide is unsymmetrically substituted, a question of regioselectivity arises. The
products from SN2 and SN2' are different and the normal result is that nucleophilic attack
occurs at the less hindered end of the allylic system, whether that means SN2 or SN2'. This
important allylic bromide, known as prenyl bromide, normally reacts entirely via the SN2
reaction.

The two ends of the allylic system are contrasted sterically: direct (SN2) attack is at a primary
carbon while allylic (SN2') attack is at a tertiary carbon atom so that steric hindrance favours
the SN2 reaction. In addition, the number of substituents on the alkene product means that
the SN2 product is nearly always preferred—SN2 gives a trisubstituted alkene while the SN2'
product has a less stable monosubstituted alkene.
An important example is the reaction of prenyl bromide with phenols. This is simply carried out with K2CO3 in acetone as phenols are acidic enough (pKa ~ 10) to be substantially
deprotonated by carbonate. The product is almost entirely from the SN2 route, and is used in
the Claisen rearrangement (Chapter 35).

- So far we have used the
word ‘allyl’ to describe these
compounds. Strictly, that word
applies only to specifi c
compounds CH2=CH–CH2X
with no substituents other than
hydrogen. Allyl is often used
loosely to describe any
compound with a functional
group on the carbon atom next
to the alkene. We shall use
‘allylic’ for that and ‘allyl’ only
for the unsubstituted version.

If we make the two ends of the allyl system more similar, say one end primary and one end
secondary, things are more equal. We could consider the two isomeric butenyl chlorides.

All routes look reasonable, although we might again expect faster attack at the primary
carbon. The reactions in the left-hand box are preferred to those in the right-hand box. But
there is no special preference for the SN2 over the SN2' mechanism or vice versa—the individual case decides. If we react the secondary butenyl chloride with an amine we get the SN2'
mechanism entirely.

If the primary chloride is used, once again we get nucleophilic attack at the primary centre.

Notice that these reactions take place with allylic chlorides. We should not expect an alkyl
chloride to be particularly good at SN2 reactions as chloride ion is only a moderate leaving
group and we should normally prefer to use alkyl bromides or iodides. Allylic chlorides are
more reactive because of the alkene. Even if the reaction occurs by a simple SN2 mechanism
without rearrangement, the alkene is still making the molecule more electrophilic.
You might ask a very good question at this point. How do we know that these reactions
really take place by SN2 and SN2' mechanisms and not by an SN1 mechanism via the stable allyl
cation? Well in the case of prenyl bromide, we don’t! In fact, we suspect that the cation probably is an intermediate because prenyl bromide and its allylic isomer are in rapid equilibrium
in solution at room temperature.


**Br**

primary isomer
prenyl bromide
>99%


**Br**

tertiary isomer
<1%


The equilibrium is entirely in favour of prenyl bromide because of its more highly substituted double bond. Reactions on the tertiary allylic isomer are very likely to take place by the
SN1 mechanism: the cation is stable because it is tertiary and allylic and the equilibration tells
us it is already there. Even if the reactions were bimolecular, no SN2' mechanism would be
necessary for the tertiary bromide because it can equilibrate to the primary isomer more rapidly than the SN2 or SN2' reaction takes place.
Even the secondary system we also considered is in rapid equilibrium when the leaving
group is bromide. This time both allylic isomers are present, and the primary allylic isomer
(known as crotyl bromide) is an E/Z mixture. The bromides can be made from either alcohol
with HBr and the same ratio of products results, indicating a common intermediate in the two
mechanisms. You saw at the beginning of Chapter 15 that this reaction is restricted to alcohols that can react by SN1.

Displacement of the bromide by cyanide ion, using the copper(I) salt as the reagent, gives a
mixture of nitriles in which the more stable primary nitrile predominates even more. These
can be separated by a clever device. Hydrolysis in concentrated HCl is successful with the
predominant primary nitrile but the more hindered secondary nitrile does not hydrolyse.
Separation of compounds having two different functional groups is easy: in this case the acid
can be extracted into aqueous base, leaving the neutral nitrile in the organic layer.

Once again, we do not know for sure whether this displacement by cyanide goes by the SN1

chlorides do not equilibrate and so, if we want a clear-cut result on a single well-defi ned starting material, the chlorides are the compounds to use. But you already see that regioslectivity
with allylic compounds may depend on steric hindrance, rates of reaction, and stability of
the product.

Allylic alcohols are good starting materials for making allylic compounds with control over
where the double bond and the leaving group will be. Allylic alcohols are easily made by addition of Grignard reagents or organolithium compounds to enals or enones (Chapter 9) or by
reduction of enals or enones (Chapter 23). More to the point, they do not equilibrate except
in strongly acidic solution, so we know which allylic isomer we have.

Conversion of the alcohols into the chlorides is easier with the primary than with the secondary alcohols. We need to convert OH into a leaving group and provide a source of chloride

and LiCl.

This result hardly looks worth reporting and, anyway, how do we know that equilibration
or SN1 reactions aren’t happening? Well, here the mechanism must be SN2 because the corresponding Z-allylic alcohol preserves its alkene confi guration. If there were equilibration of any
sort, the Z-alkene would give the E-alkene because E- and Z-allylic cations are not geometrically stable.

The fi rst thing that happens is that the lone pair on phosphorus attacks one of the chlorine
atoms in the chloroketone. The leaving group in this SN2 reaction at chlorine is an enolate,
which is a basic species and can remove the proton from the OH group in the allylic alcohol.

- We looked at the converse—
‘loose’ SN2 transition states with
considerable SN1 character—in
the reactions of bromonium ions
and protonated epoxides in
Chapter 17.


The next step is a true SN2 reaction at carbon as the very good leaving group is displaced.
The already strong P–O single bond becomes an even stronger P=O double bond to compensate for the loss of the strong C–O single bond. There is obviously no SN1 component in this
displacement (otherwise the Z-alkene would have partly isomerized to the E-alkene) and very
little SN2' presumably as only 0.5% of the rearrangement product is formed. These displacements of Ph3P=O are often the ‘tightest’ of SN2 reactions.
Now for the really impressive result. Even if the alcohol is secondary, and the rearranged
product would be thermodynamically more stable, very little of it is formed and almost all the
reaction is clean SN2.

There is a bit more rearrangement than there was with the other isomer but that is only to
be expected. The very high proportion of direct SN2 product shows that there is a real preference for the SN2 over the SN2' reaction in this displacement.
Now that we know how to make allylic chlorides of known structure—whether primary or
secondary—we need to discover how to replace the chlorine with a nucleophile with predictable regioselectivity. We have said little so far about carbon nucleophiles (except cyanide ion) so
we shall concentrate on simple carbon nucleophiles in the SN2' reaction of allylic chlorides.

###### The SN2' reaction of carbon nucleophiles on allylic chlorides

Ordinary carbon nucleophiles such as cyanide or Grignard reagents or organolithium compounds fi t the patterns we have described already. They usually give the more stable product by
SN2 or SN2' reactions depending on the starting material. If we use copper compounds, there is a
tendency—no more than that—to favour the SN2' reaction. You will recall that copper(I) was the
metal we used to ensure conjugate addition to enones (Chapter 22) and its use in SN2' reactions
is obviously related. Simple alkyl copper reagents (RCu, known as Gilman reagents) generally
favour the SN2' reaction but we can do much better by using RCu complexed with BF3.

The copper must complex to the alkene and then transfer the alkyl group to the SN2'

The secondary allylic isomer also gives almost entirely the rearranged product. This is perhaps less surprising, as the major product is the more stable isomer, but it means that either
product can be formed in high yield simply by choosing the right (or should we say wrong,
since there is complete allylic rearrangement during the reaction) isomer. The reaction is

###### Electrophilic attack on conjugated dienes

Another way to make allylic chlorides is by treating dienes with HCl. Electrophiles attack
conjugated dienes more readily than they do isolated alkenes. There was some discussion of
this in Chapter 19, establishing the main point that the terminal carbon atoms are the most
nucleophilic and that the initial attack produces an allylic cation. A simple example is the
addition of HCl to cyclopentadiene.

Although there is a question of regioselectivity in the initial protonation, the allylic cation
is symmetrical and attack by chloride at either end produces the same product. However, if
the electrophile is a halogen rather than HCl or HBr then the reaction becomes regioselective
as the cationic intermediate is no longer symmetrical. What happens is this:

The alternative is direct attack on the bromonium ion intermediate, which we assume would
occur at the allylic site (black arrows) and not at the other (green arrows). Although this
1,2-dibromide product is not observed, it is still possible that this reaction happens because the
1,2-product can rearrange by bromide shift to the observed 1,4-dibromide.

The fi nal product of this reaction could in fact be either of two compounds as the two bromine atoms may be cis or trans. Bromination in chloroform at –20 °C gives mostly a liquid cis
dibromide while reaction in hydrocarbon solvents gives the crystalline _trans isomer. On_
standing the cis isomer slowly turns into the trans.

Similar questions arise when nucleophilic substitution occurs on the dibromides. Reaction
of either the cis or the trans dibromide with dimethylamine gives the trans isomer of a diamine.
But look at the regioselectivity—it’s not the diamine you might expect. The only explanation
is one SN2 displacement and one SN2' displacement.

If the nucleophile is different from the electrophile we can get a bit more information
about the course of the reaction. When butadiene is treated with bromine in methanol as
solvent, two adducts are formed in a 15:1 ratio along with some dibromide. Methanol is a
weak nucleophile and adds to the bromonium ion mainly at the allylic position (black
arrow below); only a small amount of product is formed by attack at the far end of the
allylic system. Note that no attack occurs at the other end of the bromonium ion (green
dotted arrow).

In Chapter 22 we devoted considerable space to discussing conjugate addition and the reasons
why some reactions occur by direct attack on the carbonyl group of an α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl compound and why others occur by conjugate addition. We shall briefl y revise the
regioselectivity aspects of these reactions.

Direct (or 1,2) addition means that the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl group directly. An
addition compound is formed which may lose X[−], if it is a leaving group, or become protonated to give an alcohol.

Conjugate (or 1,4) addition means that the nucleophile adds to the end of the alkene
furthest from the carbonyl group. The electrons move through into the carbonyl group to
produce an enolate anion that usually becomes protonated to give a ketone.

The fi rst difference between the two routes is that the product from direct addition keeps
the alkene but loses the carbonyl group while conjugate addition keeps the carbonyl group but
loses the alkene. As a C=O π bond is stronger than a C=C π bond, conjugate addition gives
**the thermodynamic product. But as the carbonyl group is more electrophilic than the far**
end of the alkene, especially to charged, hard nucleophiles, direct addition gives the kinetic
**product. So direct addition is favoured by low temperatures and short reaction times while**
conjugate addition is favoured by higher temperatures and longer reaction times, provided
the 1,2 addition is reversible.

The second difference depends on how electrophilic is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The more electrophilic such as aldehydes and acid chlorides tend to prefer direct addition while the less electrophilic such as ketones or esters tend to prefer conjugate addition.

It is similar with the choice of nucleophile: more nucleophilic species, such as MeLi or
Grignard reagents, prefer direct addition, particularly as they react irreversibly, while less
nucleophilic species like amines and thiols prefer conjugate addition. These nucleophiles add
reversibly to the C=O group, giving an opportunity for any direct addition product to revert
to starting materials and react again.

###### Regioselectivity in action

We fi nish with an example that illustrates several aspects of chemoselectivity as well as introducing the subjects of the next two chapters. The fi rst synthetic sweetener was saccharin but
newer ones such as the BASF compound thiophenesaccharin are much in demand. The
sodium salt is the active sweetener but the neutral compound has to be made via the simpler
intermediate thiophene.

The synthesis started with a conjugate addition of a thiol to an unsaturated ester. The thiol
is obviously the nucleophile and regioselectively chooses conjugate addition rather than
attack on either ester group.



- The thiol could attack its
own ester group, leading to
polymerization, but it doesn’t.


In the next step the diester is treated with base and a carbonyl condensation reaction occurs
of the type you will meet in Chapter 26. There is a real question of regioselectivity here: an
enolate could form next to either ester (as shown by the orange circles) and would then attack
the other ester as a nucleophile. There is little to choose between these alternatives but the
fi rst was wanted and was selected by careful experimentation, although only in 50% yield.
This was acceptable on a large scale as the product could be separated by crystallization, the
most practical of all methods.

###### Carbonyl groups show diverse reactivity

In earlier chapters we discussed the two types of reactivity displayed by the carbonyl group.
We fi rst described reactions that involve nucleophilic attack on the carbon of the carbonyl,
and in Chapter 9 we showed you that these are among the best ways of making new C–C
bonds. In this chapter we shall again be making new C–C bonds, but using electrophilic attack
on carbonyl compounds: in other words, the carbonyl compound will be reacting as the
nucleophile in the reaction. We introduced the nucleophilic forms of carbonyl compounds—
enols and enolates—in Chapter 20. There you saw them reacting with electrophiles based on
elements other than carbon, but they will also react well with carbon electrophiles provided
the reaction is thoughtfully devised. Much of this chapter will concern that phrase, ‘thoughtfully devised’.

Thought is needed to ensure that the carbonyl compound exhibits the right sort of reactivity. In particular, the carbonyl compound must not act as an electrophile when it is intended
to be a nucleophile. If it does, it may react with itself to give some sort of dimer—or even a
polymer—rather than neatly attacking the desired electrophile. This chapter will consider
ways of avoiding unwanted nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl C=O bond.
Fortunately, over the last four decades lots of thought has already gone into the problem of
controlling the reactions of enolates with carbon electrophiles. This means that there are
many excellent solutions to the problem: our task in this chapter is to help you understand
which to use, and when to use them, in order to design useful reactions.

###### Some important considerations that affect all alkylations

The alkylations in this chapter will each consist of two steps. The fi rst is the formation
of a stabilized anion—usually (but not always) an enolate—by deprotonation with base.

The second is a substitution reaction: attack of the nucleophilic anion on an electrophilic
alkyl halide. All the factors controlling SN1 and SN2 reactions, which we discussed at length
in Chapter 15, are applicable here.

**O**


**R[1]**


**B**


weak base **R[2]** **X** **R[2]**

In each case, we shall take one of two approaches to the choice of base.

 - A strong base (with a conjugate acid of pKa greater than that of the carbonyl
compound) can be chosen to deprotonate the starting material completely. There is
complete conversion of the starting material to the anion before addition of the
electrophile, which is added in a subsequent step.

 - Alternatively, a weaker base may be used in the presence of the electrophile. The weaker
base will not deprotonate the starting material completely because its conjugate acid
has a lower pKa than the carbonyl compound: only a small amount of anion will be
formed, but that small amount will react with the electrophile. More anion is formed
as alkylation uses it up.

The second approach is easier practically (just mix the starting material, base, and electrophile), but works only if the base and the electrophile are compatible and don’t react together.
With the fi rst approach, which is practically more demanding, the electrophile and base
never meet each other, so their compatibility is not a concern. We shall start with some compounds that avoid the problem of competing aldol reactions completely because they are not
electrophilic enough to react with their own nucleophilic derivatives.

###### Nitriles and nitroalkanes can be alkylated

Problems that arise from the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group can be avoided by replacing C=O by functional groups that are much less electrophilic but are still able to stabilize an
adjacent anion. We shall consider two examples, both of which you met in Chapter 20.

###### Alkylation of nitriles

The nitrile group, which mirrors the carbonyl group in general reactivity, is much less easily
attacked by nucleophiles (N is less electronegative than O). The anion formed by deprotonating a nitrile using strong base will not react with other molecules of nitrile but will react
very effi ciently with alkyl halides. The slim, linear structure of the anions makes them good
nucleophiles for SN2 reactions.

###### Phase transfer catalysis

This reaction is carried out in a
two-phase mixture (water + an
immiscible organic solvent) to
prevent the hydroxide and propyl
bromide reacting together to give
propanol. The hydroxide stays in
the aqueous layer, and the other
reagents stay in the organic layer.
A tetraalkylammonium chloride
(benzyltriethylammonium chloride
BnEt3N[+]Cl[−]) is needed as a phase
transfer catalyst to allow suffi cient
hydroxide to enter the organic
layer to deprotonate the nitrile.


-----

- Remember our discussion
about the lack of nucleophilicity
of hydride (H[−]) in Chapter 6?
Here is hydride acting as a base
even in the presence of the
electrophile: there was no need
to do this reaction in two steps
because the base and
electrophile don’t react with one
another.


Nitrile-stabilized anions are so nucleophilic that they will react with alkyl halides rather
well even when a crowded quaternary centre (a carbon bearing no H atoms) is being formed.
In this example the strong base, sodium hydride, was used to deprotonate the branched
nitrile completely and benzyl chloride was the electrophile. The greater reactivity of benzylic electrophiles compensates for the poorer leaving group. In DMF, the anion is particularly reactive because it is not solvated (as you saw in Chapter 12, p. 255, DMF solvates only
the Na[+] cation).

**Cl**


The compatibility of sodium hydride with electrophiles means that, by adding two equivalents of base, alkylation can be encouraged to occur more than once. This dimethylated acid
was required in the synthesis of a potential drug, and it was made in two steps from a nitrile.

Double alkylation with two equivalents of NaH in the presence of excess methyl iodide gave

###### Multiple alkylation

Multiple alkylation is not always
desirable, and one of the side
reactions in alkylations that are
intended to go only once is the
formation of doubly alkylated
products. These arise when the
fi rst alkylation product still has
acidic protons and can be
deproto nated to form another
anion, which may in turn react
further. Clearly, this is more likely
to be a problem if the base is
present in excess and can usually
be restricted by using only one
equivalent of the electrophile.


If the electrophile and the nitrile are in the same molecule and the spacing between them
is appropriate, then intramolecular alkylation entails cyclization to form rings. The preparation of a cyclopropane is shown using sodium hydroxide as the base and chloride as a leaving
group. With an intramolecular alkylation, the base and the electrophile necessarily have to be
present together, but the cyclization is so fast that competing SN2 substitution of Cl[−] by HO[−] is
not a problem.


With two nitrile groups, the delocalized anion is so stable that even a weak, neutral amine
(triethylamine) is suffi ciently basic to deprotonate the starting material. Here double alkylation again takes place, in 100% yield: note that the electrophile is good at SN2, and the dipolar aprotic solvent DMSO (like DMF) cannot solvate the ‘enolate’ anion, making it more
reactive.

###### Alkylation of nitroalkanes

The powerful electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group means that deprotonation is
possible even with quite weak bases. The pKa of MeNO2 is 10, about the same as phenol.


-----

Protons adjacent to a nitro group are in fact about as acidic as the same proton adjacent to two
carbonyl groups; you can think of a nitro group as having double the electron-withdrawing
power of a carbonyl group. Nitro-stabilized anions (‘nitronate anions’) react with carbon
electro philes and a wide variety of nitro-containing products can be produced. The anions
are not, of course, enolates, but replacing the nitrogen with a carbon should help you to recognize the close similarity of these alkylations with the enolate alkylations described later.

nitroalkane nitro-stabilized anion

Surprisingly few simple nitroalkanes are commercially available but more complex examples can be prepared readily by alkylation of the anions derived from nitromethane, nitroethane, and 2-nitropropane. For example, deprotonation of nitropropane with butyllithium
followed by the addition of butyl iodide gives 3-nitroheptane in good yield. This reaction
really does have to be done in two steps: BuLi is not compatible with alkyl halides!

Nitroalkanes can be alkylated in a single step with hydroxide as a base: phase transfer conditions (see p. 585) keep the HO[−] and the electrophile apart, preventing alcohol formation. The
reaction below on the left works despite the quaternary carbon atom in the product. The reaction on the right gives a cyclic nitroalkane: now there really is no alternative: the base and
electrophile must cohabit in the reaction mixture, so a weaker base such as potassium carbonate must be used—hydroxide or amines are no good here because they would undergo substitution reactions with the halide.

###### Choice of electrophile for alkylation

Enolate alkylations are SN2 reactions (polar solvents, good charged nucleophile) so the electrophile needs to be SN2-reactive if the alkylation is to succeed: primary and benzylic alkyl halides are among the best alkylating agents. More branched halides tend to prefer unwanted E2
elimination reactions because the anions themselves are basic. As a result, tertiary halides are
useless for enolate alkylation. We shall see a way round this problem later in the chapter.

###### Lithium enolates of carbonyl compounds

The problem of self-condensation of carbonyl compounds (that is, enolate reacting with
un enolized carbonyl) under basic conditions does not exist if there is absolutely no unenolized carbonyl compound present. One way to achieve this is to use a base suffi ciently strong

a reminder: how to make LDA


**H**

**N**


diisopropylamine


(pKa at least 3 or 4 units higher than pKa of the carbonyl compound) to ensure that all of the
starting carbonyl is converted into the corresponding enolate. This will work only if the
resulting enolate is suffi ciently stable to survive until the alkylation is complete. As you saw
in Chapter 20, lithium enolates are stable, and are among the best enolate equivalents for use
in alkylation reactions.
The best base for making lithium enolates is usually LDA, made from diisopropylamine
(i-Pr2NH) and BuLi. LDA will deprotonate virtually all ketones and esters that have an acidic
proton to form the corresponding lithium enolates rapidly, completely, and irreversibly even
at the low temperatures (about –78°C) required for some of these reactive species to survive.
Deprotonation occurs through a cyclic mechanism, which is illustrated below for ketones and
esters. The basic nitrogen anion removes the proton as the lithium is delivered to the forming
oxyanion.

unsymmetrical ketones are
deprotonated. We shall discuss
this aspect later in the chapter.


###### Alkylations of lithium enolates

The reaction of these lithium enolates with alkyl halides is one of the most important C–C
bond-forming reactions in chemistry. Alkylation of lithium enolates works with both acyclic
and cyclic ketones as well as with acyclic and cyclic esters (lactones). The general mechanism

Typical experimental conditions for reactions of kinetic enolates involve formation of the
enolate at very low temperature (–78°C) in THF. The strong base LDA is used to avoid selfcondensation of the carbonyl compound but, while the enolate is forming, there is always a
chance that self-condensation will occur. The lower the temperature, the slower the selfcondensation reaction, and the fewer by-products there are. Once enolate formation is complete, the electrophile is added (still at –78°C: the lithium enolates may not be stable at higher
temperatures). The reaction mixture is then usually allowed to warm up to room temperature
to speed up the rate of the SN2 alkylation.

Precisely this sequence was used to methylate the ketone below, with LDA acting as base followed by methyl iodide as electrophile.

Their stability at low temperature means that lithium enolates are usually preferred, but
sodium and potassium enolates can also be formed by abstraction of a proton by strong bases.
The increased separation of the metal cation from the enolate anion with the larger alkali
metals leads to more reactive but less stable enolates. Typical very strong Na and K bases
include the hydrides (NaH, KH) or amide anions derived from ammonia (NaNH2, KNH2) or
hexamethyldisilazane (NaHMDS, KHMDS). The instability of the enolates means that they
are usually made and reacted in a single step, so the base and electrophile need to be compatible. Here are two examples of cyclohexanone alkylation: the high reactivity of the potassium
enolate is demonstrated by the effi cient tetramethylation with excess potassium hydride and
methyl iodide.

In Chapter 26 you will meet the reaction of an ester with its own enolate: the Claisen condensation. This reaction can be an irritating side reaction in the chemistry of lithium ester
enolates when alkylation is desired, and again it can be avoided only if the ester is converted
entirely to its enolate under conditions where the Claisen condensation is slow. A good way
of stopping this happening is to add the ester to the solution of LDA (and not the LDA to the
ester) so that there is never excess ester for the enolate to react with. Another successful tactic
is to make the group R as large as possible to discourage attack at the carbonyl group. Tertiary
butyl esters are particularly useful in this regard because they are readily made, t-butyl is
extremely bulky, and yet they can still be hydrolysed in aqueous acid under mild conditions
by the method discussed on p. 556. In this example, deprotonation of t-butyl acetate gives a
lithium enolate that reacts with butyl iodide as the reaction mixture is warmed to room
temperature.

###### Alkylation of carboxylic acids

The lithium enolates of carboxylic acids can be formed if two equivalents of base are used: one
to make the carboxylate anion and one to make the enolate. It is not necessary to use a strong
base to remove the fi rst proton but, since the second deprotonation requires a strong base such
as LDA, it is often convenient to use two equivalents of LDA to form the dianion. With carboxylic acids, even BuLi can be used on occasion because the intermediate lithium carboxylate is much less electrophilic than an aldehyde or a ketone.

The next alkylation of an acid enolate is of a carbamate-protected amino acid, glycine. As
you saw in Chapter 23, carbamate protecting groups are stable to basic reaction conditions.
Three acidic protons are removed by LDA, but alkylation takes place only at carbon—the site
of the last proton to be removed. Alkylation gets rid of one of the negative charges, so that, if
the molecule gets a choice, it alkylates to get rid of the least stable anion, keeping the two more

###### Alkylation of aldehydes: avoid LDA

Aldehydes are so electrophilic that, even with LDA at –78°C, the rate at which the deprotonation takes place is not fast enough to outpace reactions between the forming lithium enolate
and still-to-be-deprotonated aldehyde remaining in the mixture. Direct addition of the base
to the carbonyl group of electrophilic aldehydes can also pose a problem.

###### Using specifi c enol equivalents to alkylate aldehydes and ketones

These side reactions mean that aldehyde enolates are not generally useful reactive intermediates. Instead, there are a number of aldehyde enol and enolate equivalents in which the aldehyde is present only in masked form during the enolization and alkylation step. The three
most important of these specifi c enol equivalents are:

 - enamines

 - silyl enol ethers

 - aza-enolates derived from imines.

You met these enolate equivalents briefl y in Chapter 20, and we shall discuss how to use
them to alkylate aldehydes shortly. All three types of specifi c enol equivalent are useful not
just with aldehydes, but with ketones as well, and we shall introduce each class with examples
for both types of carbonyl compound.

###### Enamines are alkylated by reactive electrophiles

Enamines are formed when aldehydes or ketones react with secondary amines. The mechanism is given in Chapter 11. The mechanism below shows how they react with alkylating
agents to form new carbon–carbon bonds: the enamine here is the one derived from cyclohexanone and pyrrolidine. The product is at fi rst not a carbonyl compound: it’s an iminium ion
or an enamine (depending on whether an appropriate proton can be lost). But a mild acidic
hydrolysis converts the iminium ion or enamine into the corresponding alkylated carbonyl
compound.

The overall process, from carbonyl compound to carbonyl compound, amounts to an enolate alkylation, but no strong base or enolates are involved so there is no danger of self-condensation. The example below shows two specifi c examples of cyclohexanone alkylation
using an enamine. Note the relatively high temperatures and long reaction times: enamines
are among the most reactive of neutral nucleophiles, but they are still a lot less nucleophilic
than enolates.

The choice of the secondary amine for formation of the enamine is not completely arbitrary
even though it does not end up in the fi nal alkylated product. Simple dialkyl amines can be
used but cyclic amines such as pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine are popular choices as
the ring structure makes both the starting amine and the enamine more nucleophilic (the
alkyl groups are ‘tied back’ and can’t get in the way). The higher boiling points of these
amines allow the enamine to be formed by heating.
α-Bromo carbonyl compounds are excellent electrophiles for SN2 reactions because of the
rate-enhancing effect of the carbonyl group (Chapter 15). The protons between the halogen
and the carbonyl are signifi cantly more acidic than those adjacent to just a carbonyl group and
there can be a serious risk of an enolate nucleophile acting as a base. Enamines are only very
weakly basic, but react well as nucleophiles with α-bromo carbonyl compounds, and so are a
good choice.

- Note how the preference for
the less substituted enamine is
opposite to the preference for a
more substituted enol:
see p. 465.


The starting ketone here is unsymmetrical, so two enamines are possible. However, the
formation of solely the less substituted enamine is typical. The outcome may be explained as
the result of thermodynamic control: enamine formation is reversible so the less hindered
enamine predominates. For the more substituted enamine, steric hindrance forces the enamine to lose planarity, and destabilizes it. The less substituted enamine, on the other hand, is
rather more stable.

There is, however, a major problem with enamines: reaction at nitrogen. Less reactive
alkylating agents—simple alkyl halides such as methyl iodide, for example—react to a signifi cant degree at N rather than at C. The product is a quaternary ammonium salt, which hydrolyses back to the starting material and leads to low yields.

That said, enamines are a good solution to the aldehyde enolate problem. Aldehydes form
enamines very easily (one of the advantages of the electrophilic aldehyde) and these are
immune to attack by nucleophiles—including, most importantly, the enamines themselves.
Below are two examples of aldehyde alkylation using the enamine method. Both again use
highly SN2-reactive electrophiles, and this is the main limitation of enamines.

###### Aza-enolates react with a wider range of SN2-reactive electrophiles

Enamines are the nitrogen analogues of enols and provide one solution to the aldehyde enolate problem when the electrophile is reactive. Imines are the corresponding nitrogen analogues of aldehydes and ketones: a little lateral thinking should therefore lead you to expect
some useful reactivity from the nitrogen equivalents of enolates, known as aza-enolates. Azaenolates are formed when imines are treated with LDA or other strong bases.
In basic or neutral solution, imines are less electrophilic than aldehydes: they react with
organolithiums, but not with many weaker nucleophiles (they are more electrophilic in
acid when they are protonated). So, as the aza-enolate forms, there is no danger at all of
self-condensation.

The overall sequence involves formation of the imine from the aldehyde that is to be
alkylated—usually with a bulky primary amine such as t-butyl- or cyclohexylamine to discourage even further nucleophilic attack at the imine carbon. The imine is not usually isolated, but is deprotonated directly with LDA or a Grignard reagent (these do not add to imines,
but they will deprotonate them to give magnesium aza-enolates).

The resulting aza-enolate reacts like a ketone enolate with SN2-reactive alkylating agents—

aldehydes.

In the next example, a lithium base (lithium diethylamide) is used to form the aza-enolate.
The ease of imine cleavage in acid is demonstrated by the selective hydrolysis to the aldehyde
without any effect on the acetal introduced by the alkylation step. The product is a monoprotected dialdehyde, which is diffi cult to prepare by other methods.

Aza-enolate alkylation is so successful that it has been extended from aldehydes, where
it is essential, to ketones, where it can be a useful option. Cyclohexanones are among the
most electrophilic simple ketones and can suffer from undesirable side reactions. The
imine from cyclohexanone and cyclohexylamine can be deprotonated with LDA to give a
lithium aza-enolate. In this example, iodomethylstannane was the alkylating agent, giving
the tin-containing ketone after hydrolysis.

**Aza-enolates are the best general solution for alkylating aldehydes with most electrophiles. With**
**very SN2-reactive alkylating agents, enamines can be used, and with very SN1-reactive alkylating**
**agents, silyl enol ethers must be used.**


-----

###### Silyl enol ethers are alkylated by SN1-reactive electrophiles in the presence of Lewis acid

While the greater nucleophilicity of azaenolates means that they will react with a wider range
of electrophiles, their basicity, like that of lithium enolates, means that they will not react
with SN1-reactive electrophiles like tertiary alkyl halides. The solution to this problem is to use
silyl enol ethers, which are less reactive and so require a more potent electrophile to initiate
reaction. Carbocations will do, and they can be generated in situ by abstraction of a halide or
other leaving group from a saturated carbon atom.

The best alkylating agents for silyl enol ethers are tertiary alkyl halides: they form stable

the type of compound that is unsuitable for reaction with lithium enolates or enamines, as
elimination results rather than alkylation: a nice piece of complementary selectivity. Below is
an example: the alkylation of cyclopentanone with 2-chloro-2-methylbutane. The ketone was
converted to the trimethylsilyl enol ether with triethylamine and trimethylsilylchloride: we
discussed this step on p. 466 (Chapter 20). Titanium tetrachloride in dry dichloromethane
promotes the alkylation step.

###### Alkylation of β-dicarbonyl compounds

The presence of two, or even three, electron-withdrawing groups on a single carbon atom
makes the remaining proton(s) suffi ciently acidic (pKa 10–15) that even mild bases can lead to
complete enolate formation. Bases of the strength of alkoxides (pKa of ROH = ca. 16) cannot
deprotonate simple carbonyl compounds (pKa 20–25) completely, but readily generate anions
stabilized by more than one electron-withdrawing group. The most important enolates of this
type are those of 1,3-dicarbonyl (or β-dicarbonyl) compounds.
The resulting anions are alkylated very effi ciently. This diketone is enolized even by potassium carbonate, and reacts with methyl iodide in good yield. Carbonate is such a bad nucleophile that the base and the electrophile can be added in a single step.

With these two esters, the choice of base is important: nucleophilic addition can occur at
the ester carbonyl, which could lead to transesterifi cation (with alkoxides), hydrolysis
(with hydroxide), or amide formation (with amide anions). The best choice is usually an
alkoxide identical with the alkoxide component of the ester (that is, ethoxide for diethyl
malonate, _methoxide for dimethyl malonate). Alkoxides are basic enough to deprotonate_
between two carbonyl groups but, should substitution occur at C=O, there is no overall
reaction.
In the fi rst example below the electrophile is the allylic cyclopentenyl chloride, and the base
is ethoxide in ethanol—most conveniently made by adding one equivalent of sodium metal
to dry ethanol. The same base is used in the second alkylation, of ethyl acetoacetate with
butyl bromide.

Various electron-withdrawing groups can be used in almost any combination with good
results. In this example an ester and a nitrile cooperate to stabilize an anion. Nitriles are not
quite as anion-stabilizing as carbonyl groups so this enolate requires a stronger base (sodium
hydride) in an aprotic solvent (DMF) for success. The primary alkyl tosylate serves as the
electrophile.

These doubly stabilized anions are alkylated so well that it is common to carry out an alkylation between two carbonyl groups, only to remove one of them at a later stage. This is made
possible by the fact that carboxylic acids with a β-carbonyl group decarboxylate (lose carbon
dioxide) on heating. The mechanism below shows how. After alkylation of the dicarbonyl
compound the unwanted ester is fi rst hydrolysed in base. Acidifi cation and heating lead to


-----

decarboxylation via a six-membered cyclic transition state in which the acid proton is transferred to the carbonyl group as the key bond breaks, liberating a molecule of carbon dioxide.
The initial product is the enol form of a carbonyl compound that rapidly tautomerizes to the
more stable keto form—now with only one carbonyl group. Using this technique, β-ketoesters give ketones while malonate esters give simple carboxylic acids (both ester groups
hydrolyse but only one can be lost by decarboxylation). Decarboxylation can occur only with
a second carbonyl group appropriately placed β to the acid, because the decarboxylated product must be formed as an enol.

The alkylation of ethyl acetoacetate with butyl bromide on p. 596 was done with the

Esters are much easier to work with than carboxylic acids, and a useful alternative procedure
removes one ester group without having to hydrolyse the other. The malonate ester is heated
in a polar aprotic solvent—usually DMSO—in the presence of sodium chloride and a little
water. No acid or base is required and, apart from the high temperature, the conditions are
fairly mild. The scheme below shows a dimethyl malonate alkylation (note that NaOMe is

- tert-Butyl esters also typically

on p. 556. With a t-butyl group
the mechanism is of course SN1.


The mechanism of decarboxylation is a rather unusual type of ester cleavage reaction. The
bond that breaks is not the MeO–CO bond but instead the O–alkyl bond: the reaction is an
SN2 substitution of carboxylate by Cl[−].

Chloride is a poor nucleophile, but it is more reactive in DMSO, by which it cannot be
solvated. And, as soon as the carboxylate is displaced, the high temperature encourages
(entropy again) irreversible decarboxylation. The other by-product, MeCl, is also lost
as a gas. The ‘decarboxylation’ (in fact, removal of a CO2Me group, not CO2) is known
as the **Krapcho decarboxylation. Because of the SN2 step, it works best with** _methyl_

We have only looked at single alkylations of dicarbonyl compounds, but there are two acidic

###### Ketone alkylation poses a problem in regioselectivity

Ketones are unique because they can have enolizable protons on both sides of the carbonyl
group. Unless the ketone is symmetrical, or unless one side of the ketone happens to have no
enolizable protons, two regioisomers of the enolate are possible and alkylation can occur on
either side to give regioisomeric products. We need to be able to control which enolate is
formed if ketone alkylations are to be useful.

###### Thermodynamically controlled enolate formation

Selective enolate formation is straightforward if the protons on one side of the ketone are
signifi cantly more acidic than those on the other. This is what you have just seen with ethyl
acetoacetate: it is a ketone, but with weak bases (pKa of the conjugate acid < 18) it only ever
enolizes on the side where the protons are acidifi ed by the second electron-withdrawing
group. If two new substituents are introduced, in the manner you have just seen, they will
always both be joined to the same carbon atom. This is an example of thermodynamic control: only the more stable of the two possible enolates is formed.

This principle can be extended to ketones whose enolates have less dramatic differences in
stability. Since enols and enolates are alkenes, the more substituents they carry the more stable
they are. So, in principle, even additional alkyl groups can control enolate formation under
thermodynamic control. Formation of the more stable enolate requires a mechanism for
equili bration between the two enolates, and this must be proton transfer. If a proton source is
available—and this can even be just excess ketone—an equilibrium mixture of the two enolates will form. The composition of this equilibrium mixture depends very much on the ketone
but, with 2-phenylcyclohexanone, conjugation ensures that only one enolate forms. The base
is potassium hydride: it’s strong, but small (and so has no diffi culty removing the more hindered proton) and can be used under conditions that permit enolate equilibration.

The more substituted lithium enolates can also be formed from the more substituted silyl
enol ethers by substitution at silicon—a reaction you met in Chapter 20. The value of this
reaction now becomes clear because the usual way of making silyl enol ethers (Me3SiCl, Et3N)
typically produces, from unsymmetrical ketones, the more substituted of the two possible
ethers. Because the silyl enol ether (unlike the enolate itself) can be purifi ed, fully regiochemically pure enolates can be formed in this way.

One possible explanation for the thermodynamic regioselectivity in the enol ether-forming
step is related to our rationalization of the regioselectivity of bromination of ketones in acid
on p. 464. Triethylamine is too weak a base (pKa of Et3NH[+] is about 10) to deprotonate the
starting carbonyl compound (pKa ca. 20), and the fi rst stage of the reaction is probably an
oxygen–silicon interaction. Loss of a proton now takes place through a cationic transition
state, and this is stabilized rather more if the proton being lost is next to the methyl group:
methyl groups stabilize partial cations just as they stabilize cations.

An alternative view is that reaction takes place through the enol: the Si–O bond is so strong
that even neutral enols react with Me3SiCl, on oxygen, of course. The predominant enol is the
more substituted, leading to the more substituted silyl enol ether.



- To understand why less
substituted C atoms have more
acidic C–H bonds, think of base
strengths: MeLi is a weaker base
than t-BuLi, so the conjugate
acid must be a stronger acid.

###### Kinetically controlled enolate formation

LDA is too hindered to attack most carbonyl C=O bonds, so it attacks C–H instead. And, if
there is a choice of C–H bonds, it will attack the least hindered possible. It will also prefer to
attack more acidic C–H bonds, and C–H bonds on less substituted carbons are indeed more
acidic. Furthermore, statistics helps, since a less substituted C atom has more protons to be
removed (three versus two in this example) so, even if the rates were the same, the less substituted enolate would predominate.

There must never be more
ketone in the mixture than base,
or exchange of protons between
ketone and enolate will lead to
equilibration. Kinetic enolate formations with LDA must be done
by adding the ketone to the LDA
so that there is excess LDA present throughout the reaction.


These factors multiply to ensure that the enolate that forms will be the one with the fewer
substituents—provided we now prevent equilibration of the enolate to the more stable, more
substituted one. This means keeping the temperature low, typically –78°C, keeping the reaction time short, and using an excess of strong base to deprotonate irreversibly and ensure that
there is no remaining ketone to act as a proton source. The enolate that we then get is the one
that formed faster, under kinetic control—known as the ‘kinetic enolate’—and not necessarily the one that is more stable.

In general, this effect is suffi cient to allow selective kinetic deprotonation of methyl ketones,
that is, where the distinction is between Me and alkyl:

###### Dianions allow unusual regioselectivity in alkylations of methyl acetoacetate

In Chapter 23, we introduced the idea that the last-formed anion in any dianion or trianion
is the most reactive. Methyl acetoacetate is usually alkylated on the central carbon atom
because that is the site of the most stable enolate. But methyl acetoacetate dianion—formed
by removing a second proton from the usual enolate with a very strong base (usually butyllithium)—reacts fi rst on the less stable anion: the terminal methyl group. Protonation of the
more stable enolate then leads to the product. Butyllithium can be used as a base because the
anionic enolate intermediate is not electrophilic.

###### Enones provide a solution to regioselectivity problems

Enolates can be made regiospecifi cally from, for example, silyl enol ethers or enol acetates just
by treating them with an alkyllithium. These are both substitution reactions in which RLi

displaces the enolate: one is SN2(Si) and the other is attack at C=O. Provided there is no proton
source, the enolate products have the same regiochemistry as their stable precursors, and
single enolate regioisomers are formed.

But there is a problem: forming enol ethers or enol esters will usually itself require a regioselective enolization! There are two situations in which this method is nonetheless useful:
when the more substituted lithium enolate (which is hard to make selectively otherwise) is
required, and when a silyl enol ether can be formed by a method not involving deprotonation.
These methods are what we shall now consider.

###### Dissolving metal reduction of enones gives enolates regiospecifi cally

In Chapter 23 you met the Birch reduction: the use of dissolving metals (K, Na, or Li in liquid
ammonia, for example) to reduce aromatic rings and alkynes. The dissolving metal reduction
of enones by lithium metal in liquid ammonia is similar to these reactions—the C=C bond of
the enone is reduced, with the C=O bond remaining untouched. An alcohol is required as a
proton source and, in total, two electrons and two protons are added in a stepwise manner,
giving net addition of a molecule of hydrogen to the double bond.
The mechanism follows that described on p. 543: transfer of an electron forms a radical
anion that is protonated by the alcohol to form a radical. A second electron transfer forms an
anion that can undergo tautomerization to an enolate.

The enolate is stable to further reduction and protonation during the work-up will give a

where the double bond of the enone was, regioselective alkylation becomes possible.

The transfer of electrons is not susceptible to steric hindrance so substituted alkenes pose no

Naturally, only one regioisomer is formed as well.

###### Conjugate addition to enones gives enolates regiospecifi cally

Although we did not talk in detail about them at that time, you will recall from Chapter 22
that conjugate addition to enones generates fi rst an enolate, which is usually protonated in
the work-up. But, again, more fruitful things can be done with the enolate under the right
conditions.

The simplest products are formed when Nu=H, but this poses a problem of regioselectivity
in the nucleophilic attack step: a nucleophilic hydride equivalent that selectively undergoes
conjugate addition to the enone is required. This is usually achieved with extremely bulky
hydride reagents such as lithium or potassium tri(sec-butyl)borohydride (often known by the
trade names of L- or K-Selectride, respectively). In this example, K-Selectride reduces the
enone to an enolate that is alkylated by methyl iodide to give a single regioisomer.

- The reaction also illustrates
the difference in reactivity
between conjugated and
isolated double bonds.


With organocopper reagents, conjugate addition introduces a new alkyl group and, if the
resulting enolates are themselves alkylated, two new C–C bonds can be formed in a single
step (a tandem reaction: one C–C bond formation rides behind another). In Chapter 22 we
explained that the best organocuprate additions are those carried out in the presence of
Me3SiCl: the product of these reactions is a silyl enol ether, formed regioselectively (the ‘enol’
double bond is always on the side where the enone used to be).

The silyl enol ethers are too unreactive for direct alkylation by an alkyl halide, but by converting them to lithium enolates all the usual alkylation chemistry becomes possible. This
type of reaction forms the key step in a synthesis of the natural product α-chamigrene.
Conjugate addition of Me2CuLi gives an enolate that is trapped with trimethylsilyl chloride.
Methyllithium converts the resulting silyl enol ether into a lithium enolate by substitution at
Si. The natural product has a spiro six-membered ring attached at the site of the enolate, and
this is made by alkylating with a dibromide (you saw this done on p. 598). The fi rst substitution is at the more reactive allylic bromide. A second enolization is needed to make the ring,
but this can be done under equilibrating conditions because the required six-membered ring
forms much faster than the unwanted eight-membered ring that would arise by attack on the
other side of the ketone.

###### Synthesis of prostaglandin E2
One of the most dramatic illustrations of the power of conjugate addition followed by alkylation is the short synthesis
of the important biological molecule prostaglandin E2 by Ryoji Noyori in Japan. The organocopper reagent and the
alkylating agent contain all the functionality required for both side chains of the target in protected form. The required
trans stereochemistry is assembled in the key step, which gives a 78% yield of a product requiring only removal of the
silyl ether and ester protecting groups. The organometallic nucleophile was prepared from a vinyl iodide by halogen–
metal exchange (Chapter 9). In the presence of copper iodide this vinyllithium adds to the cyclopentenone in a conjugate sense to give an intermediate enolate. Because in this case the starting enone already has a stereogenic centre,
this step is also stereoselective: attack on the less hindered face (opposite the silyl ether) gives the trans product. The
resulting enolate was alkylated with the allylic iodide containing the terminal ester: once again the trans product was
formed. It is particularly vital that enolate equilibration is avoided in this reaction to prevent the inevitable E1cB elimination of the silyloxy group that would occur from the other enolate. Deprotection of the silyl groups using TBAF
(Chapter 23) gives the product.

###### Using Michael acceptors as electrophiles

α,β-Unsaturated carbonyl compounds are, as you have just seen, an excellent source of regiodefi ned enolate equivalents. But they are also very effective electrophiles for reaction with
enolates. In this last section we will consider conjugate addition reactions of enolates as an
alternative way of making C–C bonds.

As with other conjugate additions, it is important in such reactions to choose conditions that
prevent the nucleophile (here the enolate) attacking the C=O group directly. The same factors
discussed in Chapter 22 govern the eventual outcome of the reaction. Thermodynamic control
leads to conjugate addition but kinetic control leads to direct addition, so the key to successful
conjugate addition is to ensure that direct addition to the carbonyl group is reversible. This
enables the conjugate addition to compete and, as its product is more stable (it loses the weaker
C=C π bond rather than the stronger C=O π), it eventually becomes the sole product.

One of the most important ways of making the direct addition reversible is to use a more

more favourable. An additional consequence of adding a second electron-withdrawing group
such as CO2Et is that the direct addition product is more hindered (and therefore less stable)
than the conjugate addition product.

###### 1,3-Dicarbonyl compounds undergo conjugate addition

β-Diesters (malonates and substituted derivatives, see p. 595) combine three useful features in
conjugate addition reactions:

 - they form stable enolate anions that undergo clean conjugate addition

 - if required, one of the ester groups can be removed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation

 - the remaining acid or ester is ideal for conversion into other functional groups.

Diethyl malonate adds to diethyl fumarate in a conjugate addition reaction promoted by
sodium ethoxide in dry ethanol to give a tetraester. Diethyl fumarate is an excellent Michael
acceptor because two ester groups withdraw electrons from the alkene. The mechanism
involves deprotonation of the malonate, conjugate addition, and reprotonation of the product
enolate by ethanol solvent. In this reaction two ester groups stabilize the enolate and two
more promote conjugate addition.

###### Alkali metal (especially Na, K) enolates can undergo conjugate addition

The use of two anion-stabilizing groups is a sure way of promoting conjugate addition, but it not
essential. Simple lithium enolates are not ideal nucleophiles for thermodynamically controlled
conjugate addition because lithium binds strongly to oxygen and so tends to stabilize the aldol
product. Better results are often observed with sodium or potassium enolates, which are more
dissociated. Potassium tert-butoxide is the ideal base for this example as it is hindered and so will
not attack the ester but is basic enough to deprotonate the ketone to a certain extent.
Two enolates are possible but, under the equilibrating conditions, the more stable enolate is
the one leading to the product with a quaternary carbon atom.

###### Enamines are convenient stable enol equivalents for conjugate addition

If you want a more reliable way of doing a conjugate addition of an aldehyde or ketone without having a second anion-stabilizing group, you need some stable and relatively unreactive
enol equivalent. On p. 591 you saw how enamines, particularly those derived from cyclic
secondary amines, are useful in alkylation reactions. These neutral species are also perfect for
conjugate addition as they are soft nucleophiles but are more reactive than enols and can be
prepared quantitatively in advance. The reactivity of enamines is such that heating the reactants together, sometimes neat, is all that is required. Acid catalysis can also be used to catalyse the reaction at lower temperature.

enamine keto-acid product

The mechanism is rather like enol addition. The differences are that the enamine is more
nucleophilic because of the nitrogen atom and that the product is also an enamine, which
can be converted into the corresponding carbonyl by mild acidic hydrolysis. This is usually
performed during the work-up and so does not really constitute an extra step. The amine is
washed out as the hydrochloride salt so isolation is straightforward. After conjugate
addition the resulting enolate-iminium ion undergoes proton transfer rapidly to produce
the more stable carbonyl-enamine tautomer. This is shown as an intramolecular process
but it could just as easily be drawn with an external base and source of protons. The
resulting enamine is then stable until aqueous acid is added at the end of the reaction.
Hydrolysis occurs via the iminium ion to reveal the second carbonyl group and release the
secondary amine.

The best alternatives to enamines for conjugate addition of enols of aldehyde, ketone, and
carboxylic acid derivatives are silyl enol ethers. These stable neutral nucleophiles react very
well with Michael acceptors either spontaneously or with Lewis acid catalysts such as TiCl4 at
low temperature. If the 1,5-dicarbonyl compound is required, then an aqueous work-up with
either acid or base cleaves the silicon–oxygen bond in the product.

Addition of the silyl enol ether derived from acetophenone (PhCOMe) to a disubstituted
enone promoted by titanium tetrachloride is very rapid and gives the diketone product in
good yield even though a quaternary carbon atom is created in the conjugate addition. This is
a typical example of this very powerful class of conjugate addition reactions.

It is even possible to use a silyl enol ether to create a new C–C bond that joins two new
quaternary centres. Silyl ketene acetals (the silyl enol ethers of esters) are more nucleophilic
than ordinary silyl enol ethers, and in this example the silyl ketene acetal undergoes conjugate addition to an unsaturated ketone catalysed by the usual Lewis acid (TiCl4) for such
reactions.

In these reactions, the electrophile coordinates to the TiCl4 Lewis acid fi rst, producing an
activated enone that is attacked by the silylated nucleophile. It is diffi cult to determine at
what stage the trimethylsilyl group moves from its original position and whether it is transferred intramolecularly to the product. In many cases the anion liberated from the Lewis acid
(Cl[−], RO[−], Br[−]) is a good nucleophile for silicon so it is reasonable to assume that there is a free
trimethylsilyl species (Me3SiX) that captures the titanium enolate:

###### A variety of electrophilic alkenes will accept enol(ate) nucleophiles

The simplest and best Michael acceptors are those α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with
exposed unsaturated β carbon atoms, such as _exo-methylene ketones, lactones, and vinyl_
ketones. However, their extreme reactivity can make than hard to handle (they polymerize
readily), and in the next chapter (p. 621) you will meet a method that makes them in situ to
circumvent these problems.

One trick to persuade a stubborn enolate to do conjugate rather than direct substitution is
to add an extra anion-stabilizing substituent in the α position. The margin shows a selection
of reagents that do this. In each case the extra group (CO2Et, SPh, SOPh, SO2Ph, SiMe3, and Br)
can be removed after the conjugate addition is complete.
Unsaturated **esters are good Michael acceptors because they are not very electrophilic.**
Unsaturated amides are even less electrophilic and (provided they are tertiary and have no

The nitrile group is not as reactive towards direct attack by nucleophiles as its carbonyl
cousins but is equally able to stabilize an adjacent negative charge. Alkenes conjugated with
nitriles are thus activated towards nucleophilic attack without the complications of competing direct addition to the activating group.

The simplest amino acid, glycine, would be an ideal starting material for the synthesis of

to help stabilization of the enolate and conjugate addition of acrylonitrile is now possible. The

You saw on p. 606 how two ester groups in fumarate diesters encourage conjugate addition,
but what if there are two different groups at the ends of the Michael acceptor? Then you must
make a judgement as to which is more electron-withdrawing. One case is clear-cut. The nitro
group is worth two carbonyl groups (p. 586) so that conjugate addition occurs β to the nitro
group in this case.

###### Nitroalkanes are superb nucleophiles for conjugate addition


**O**

**CO2Et**


In this chapter so far you have seen that highly stabilized anions, such as those derived from
β-dicarbonyl compounds, are particularly good at nucleophilic addition because their stability helps to reverse the unwanted alternative direct C=O addition (aldol) pathway, and facilitates proton transfer in the catalytic version of the reaction. The nitro group is so powerfully
electron-withdrawing that just one is equivalent to two carbonyls in pKa terms (p. 586). Thus
if β-dicarbonyls are good for conjugate addition, you might expect nitroalkanes to undergo
conjugate addition in just the same way. The good news is that they do, very well. The fi rst
stage is a base-catalysed conjugate addition.

The acidifying effect of the nitro group is so profound that very mild bases can be used to
catalyse the reaction. This enables selective removal of the proton next to the nitro group and
helps to avoid side reactions of the carbonyl component. Common examples of mild bases
include amines, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, and fl uorides. Even basic alumina (a
largely inert powder) is suffi cient to catalyse virtually quantitative addition of this benzylic
nitroalkane to cyclohexenone at room temperature!

Anions of nitro compounds form quaternary centres with ease in additions to α,βunsaturated mono- and diesters. The difference between the acidity of the protons next to a

The effectiveness of nitro compound conjugate addition makes it ideal for use in combination with other reactions in making several bonds in one pot. The next example combines
conjugate addition and intramolecular conjugate addition to make a six-membered ring.

Nef reaction


The nitro group can be converted into other useful functional groups following conjugate
addition. Reduction gives primary amines while hydrolysis reveals ketones. The hydrolysis is
known as the Nef reaction and used to be achieved by formation of the nitro-stabilized anion
with a base such as sodium hydroxide followed by hydrolysis with sulfuric acid. These conditions are rather unforgiving for many substrates (and products) so milder methods have been
developed. One of these involves reaction of the nitro ‘enolate’ with ozone (ozonolysis) at low
temperature rather than treatment with acid. Base-catalysed conjugate addition of nitro propane
to methyl vinyl ketone occurred smoothly to give the nitroketone. Formation of the salt with
sodium methoxide was followed by oxidative cleavage of the C=N linkage with ozone. The
product was a 1,4-diketone, which was isolated without further aldol reaction by this route.

###### The aldol reaction

The simplest enolizable aldehyde is acetaldehyde (ethanal, CH3CHO). What happens if we
add a small amount of base, say NaOH, to this aldehyde? Some of it will form the enolate ion.

acetaldehyde enolate ion

Only a small amount of the nucleophilic enolate ion is formed: as we pointed out in Chapter
25, hydroxide is not basic enough to enolize an aldehyde completely. Each molecule of enolate
is surrounded by molecules of the aldehyde that are not enolized and so still have the electrophilic carbonyl group intact. The enolate ion will attack one of these aldehydes to form an
alkoxide ion, which will be protonated by the water molecule formed in the fi rst step.

The product is an aldehyde with a hydroxy (ol) group and it has the trivial name aldol. The
name aldol is given to the whole class of reactions between enolates (or enols) and carbonyl
compounds even if in most cases the product is not a hydroxy-aldehyde at all. Notice that the
base catalyst (hydroxide ion) is regenerated in the last step, so it is truly a catalyst.
This reaction is so important because of the carbon–carbon bond formed when the nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic aldehyde. This bond is shown as a black bond in this
version of the key step.

The reaction occurs with ketones as well. Acetone is a good example for us to use at the start
of this chapter because it gives an important product, and as it is a symmetrical ketone, there
can be no argument over which way it enolizes. Each step is the same as the aldol sequence
with acetaldehyde, and the product is again a hydroxy-carbonyl compound, but this time a
hydroxy-ketone.

The acetaldehyde reaction works well when one drop of dilute sodium hydroxide is added
to acetaldehyde. The acetone reaction is best done with insoluble barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)2.
Both approaches keep the base concentration low. Without this precaution, the aldol products
are not the compounds isolated from the reaction. With more base, further reactions occur
because the aldol products dehydrate rather easily under the reaction conditions to give stable
conjugated unsaturated carbonyl compounds.

These are elimination reactions, and you met them in Chapter 17, where the possible mechanisms are discussed. You cannot normally eliminate water from an alcohol in basic solution
as hydroxide is a bad leaving group. It is the carbonyl group that allows elimination here:
these are E1cB reactions, with a second enolization allowing the loss of OH[−].

- You do not, of course, need
to learn each result individually:
if you ever need to do a simple
aldol reaction, you should
consult the massive review in
the 1968 volume of Organic
Reactions.


In the examples that follow you will see that the base-catalysed aldol reaction sometimes gives the aldol and sometimes the elimination product. The choice is partly based
on conditions—the more vigorous the conditions (stronger base, higher temperature,
longer time) the more likely elimination is to occur—and partly on the structure of the
reagents.
The elimination is even easier in acid solution and acid-catalysed aldol reactions commonly
give unsaturated products instead of aldols. In this simple example with a symmetrical cyclic
ketone, the enone is formed in good yield in acid or base. We shall use the acid-catalysed reaction to illustrate the mechanism. First the ketone is enolized under acid catalysis as you saw
in Chapter 20.

Then the aldol reaction takes place. Enols are less nucleophilic than enolates, and the reaction occurs because the electrophilic carbonyl component is protonated: the addition is acidcatalysed. An acid-catalysed aldol reaction takes place.

The aldol is a tertiary alcohol and would be likely to eliminate by an E1 mechanism in acid
even without the carbonyl group. But the carbonyl ensures that only the stable conjugated

###### Aldol reactions of unsymmetrical ketones

If the ketone is blocked on one side so that it cannot enolize—in other words it has no protons
on that side—only one aldol reaction is possible. Ketones of this type might bear a tertiary
alkyl or an aryl substituent. tert-Butyl methyl ketone (3,3-dimethylbutan-2-one), for example,
gives aldol reactions with various bases in 60–70% yield. Enolization cannot occur towards
the t-butyl group and must occur towards the methyl group instead.

An especially interesting case of the blocked carbonyl compound is the lactone or cyclic
ester. Open-chain esters do not give aldol reactions: they prefer a different reaction that is the
subject of the second half of this chapter. But lactones are in some ways quite like ketones (the
stretching frequencies of their C=O groups in the IR are similar, and unlike esters they react
with NaBH4) and give unsaturated carbonyl products under basic catalysis. Enolization is
unambiguous because the ester oxygen atom blocks enolization on one side.

The equilibrium does not affect
the eventual product; it simply
withdraws some of the material
out of the productive reaction.
We call this sort of equilibrium a
parasitic equilibrium as it has no
real life of its own—it just sucks
the blood of the reaction.


elimination

You might have been surprised that the intermediate in the aldol step of this reaction did not
decompose. This intermediate could be described as a tetrahedral intermediate in a nucleophilic
substitution at a carbonyl group (Chapter 10). Why then does it not break down in the usual way?

possible breakdown of a tetrahedral intermediate in a lactone aldol reaction


The best leaving group is the alkoxide and the product is quite reasonable. But what is it to
do now? The only reasonable next step is for it to close back up again. Because the lactone is a
_cyclic ester, the leaving group cannot escape—it must stay attached to the molecule. This reac-_
tion is reversible, but dehydration is effectively irreversible because it gives a stable conjugated
product. Normal, acyclic esters are different: their alkoxide leaving groups can leave, and the
result is a different sort of reaction, which you will meet later in this chapter.

###### Cross-condensations

So far we have considered only ‘self-condensations’—dimerization reactions of a single carbonyl compound. These form only a tiny fraction of known aldol reactions. Those that occur
between two different carbonyl compounds, one acting as a nucleophile in its enol or enolate
form, and the other as an electrophile, are called cross-condensations. They are more interesting than self-condensations, but working out what happens needs more thought. We shall
start with an example that works well. The ketone PhCOMe reacts with 4-nitrobenzaldehyde
in aqueous ethanol under NaOH catalysis to give a quantitative yield of an enone.

Now, in this step there was a choice. The enolate could have attacked another molecule of
unenolized ketone. It didn’t, because ketones are less reactive than aldehydes (Chapter 6). In
this case the aldehyde has an electron-withdrawing nitro substituent too, making it even more
reactive. The enolate selects the better electrophile—that is, the aldehyde.
In other cases the balance may shift towards self-condensation. You might think that a
crossed aldol reaction between acetaldehyde and benzophenone (diphenylketone Ph2C=O)
should work well.

But it won’t work. The ketone is very hindered and very conjugated. It is less electrophilic
than a normal ketone and normal ketones are less electrophilic than aldehydes. Given a
choice between attacking this ketone and attacking another (but unenolized) molecule of
acetaldehyde, the enolate will choose the aldehyde every time. The reaction at the start of the
chapter occurs, while the ketone is just a spectator.



- **Successful crossed aldol reactions**

**For this kind of crossed aldol reaction to work well we must have two conditions:**

**•** **One partner only must be capable of enolization.**

**•** **The other partner must be incapable of enolization and be more electrophilic than the**
**enolizable partner.**

**Everyone remembers the fi rst of these conditions, but it is easy to forget the second.**

###### Formaldehyde

Formaldehyde is not available as
a pure monomer because it
forms trimers and tetramers in
the pure state. The aqueous
solution ‘formalin’ used to
preserve biological specimens is
available—it is 37%
formaldehyde and mostly
consists of the hydrate
CH2(OH)2; see Chapter 6. A pure
dry polymer ‘paraform aldehyde’
is also available and was mentioned in Chapter 9. Neither of
these is particularly useful in
aldol reactions. The aqueous
solution is used in the Mannich
reaction that we describe
shortly. It is possible to make
the short-lived monomer and
capture it with a lithium enolate,
but this is not trivial
experimentally.


###### The Mannich reaction

At fi rst sight formaldehyde (methanal, CH2=O) seems the ideal electrophilic partner in a
mixed aldol reaction. It cannot enolize. (Usually we are concerned with α hydrogen atoms in
an aldehyde. Formaldehyde does not even have α carbon atoms.) And it is a super aldehyde.
Aldehydes are more electrophilic than ketones because a hydrogen atom replaces one of the
alkyl groups. Formaldehyde has two hydrogen atoms.
The trouble is that it is too reactive. It tends to react more than once and to give extra
unwanted reactions as well. You might think that condensation between acetaldehyde
and formaldehyde in base would be quite simple. The acetaldehyde alone can form an
enolate, and this enolate will attack the more electrophilic carbonyl group, which is formaldehyde. In each reaction the only possible enolate attacks another molecule of formaldehyde. By now you have got the idea so we simply draw the next enolate and the
structure of the third aldol.

Even this is not all. A fourth molecule of formaldehyde reacts with hydroxide ion and then
reduces the third aldol. This reduction is known as the Cannizzaro reaction, and is described
in the box below. The fi nal product is the highly symmetrical ‘pentaerythritol’, C(CH2OH)4,
with four CH2OH groups joined in a tetrahedral array about the same carbon atom. The overall reaction uses four molecules of formaldehyde and can give a high yield (typically 80% with
NaOH but as much as 90% with MgO) of the product.

A general solution to using formaldehyde in aldol reactions is to use the Mannich reaction.
A typical example is shown in the margin: the reaction involves an enolizable aldehyde or
ketone (here we use cyclohexanone), a secondary amine (here dimethylamine), the Mannich
reaction formaldehyde as its aqueous solution, and catalytic HCl. The product is an aminoketone from the addition of one molecule each of formaldehyde and the amine to the ketone.
The mechanism involves the preliminary formation of an imine salt from the amine and
formaldehyde. The amine is nucleophilic and attacks the more electrophilic of the two carbonyl compounds available, which is, of course, formaldehyde. No acid is needed for this
addition step, but acid-catalysed dehydration of the addition product gives the imine salt. In
the normal Mannich reaction, this is just an intermediate but it is quite stable and the corresponding iodide is sold as Eschenmoser’s salt for use in Mannich reactions.

By using this reaction, you can add one molecule of formaldehyde—and one only—to carbonyl compounds. You might, of course, reasonably object that the product is not actually an
aldol product at all—indeed, if you wanted the aldol product, the Mannich reaction would be
of little use to you. It nevertheless remains a very important reaction. First of all, it is a simple
way to make amino-ketones and many drug molecules belong to this class.
Secondly, the Mannich products can be converted to enones. The most reliable method for
making the enone is to alkylate the amine product of the Mannich reaction with MeI and
then treat the ammonium salt with base. Enolate ion formation leads to an E1cB reaction
rather like the dehydration of aldols, but with a better leaving group.

is to make the Mannich product, store that, and then to alkylate and eliminate only when the
enone is needed. We have seen how useful this is in the Michael reaction in Chapter 25.
If the enone is wanted, any secondary amine will do as it does not end up in the molecule
so the more convenient (less volatile and less smelly) cyclic amines, pyrrolidine, and piperidine, are often used. The very electrophilic enones with monosubstituted double bonds can
be made in this way.

###### Carbonyl compounds that are electrophilic but cannot enolize

Good crossed aldol condensations require one component to enolize and act as a nucleophile
and the other not to enolize and to act as the electrophile. Here follows a list of carbonyl substituents that prevent enolization and therefore force a carbonyl compound to take the role of
the electrophilic partner. They are arranged roughly in order of reactivity with the most reactive towards nucleophilic attack by an enolate at the top. You do, of course, need two substituents to block enolization so typical compounds also appear in the list. Note that the last two
entries—esters and amides—do not normally do aldol reactions with enolates, but they do
react as acylating agents for enolates, as you will see later in this chapter.

###### Compounds that can enolize but that are not electrophilic

We can complement this type of selectivity with the opposite type. Are there any compounds
that can enolize but that cannot function as electrophiles? No carbonyl compound can fi ll
this role, but in Chapter 25 (p. 585) we met some ‘enolizable’ compounds that lacked carbonyl

groups altogether. Most notable among these were the nitroalkanes. Deprotonation of nitroalkanes is not enolization nor is the product an enolate ion, but the whole thing is so similar
to enolization that it makes sense to consider them together. You saw these anions, sometimes
called nitronates, reacting with Michael acceptors in Chapter 25, and they also react well with
aldehydes and ketones.

This particular example, using cyclohexanone as the electrophile and nitromethane itself

give the ‘aldol’ in reasonable yield. Once again this reaction involves choice. Either compound could enolize and, indeed, cyclohexanone reacts well with itself under essentially the
same conditions.

Although cyclohexanone forms an enolate in the absence of nitromethane, when both
ketone and nitroalkane are present, the base prefers to remove a proton from nitromethane.
This is simply a question of pKa values. The pKa of a typical ketone is about 20 but that of
nitromethane is 10. It is not even necessary to use as strong a base as NaOH (pKa of H2O = 15.7)
to deprotonate nitromethane: an amine will do (pKa of R2NH2+ about 10) and secondary
amines are often used.
The elimination step also occurs easily with nitro compounds and is diffi cult to prevent in
reactions with aromatic aldehydes. Now you can see how the useful nitroalkene Michael
acceptors in Chapter 22 were made.

If an aldol reaction can be done with:

 - only one enolizable component

 - only one set of enolizable protons

 - a carbonyl electrophile more reactive than the compound being enolized

then you are lucky and the crossed aldol method will work. But most aldol reactions aren’t like
this: they are cross-condensations of aldehydes and ketones of various reactivities with several
different enolizable protons. Crossed aldols on most pairs of carbonyl compounds lead to
hopeless mixtures of products. In all cases that fail to meet these three criteria, a specifi c enol
equivalent will be required: one component must be turned quantitatively into an enol equivalent, which will be reacted in a separate step with an electrophile. That is what the next section is about—and you will fi nd that some of the methods have a lot in common with those
we used for alkylating enolates in Chapter 25.

###### Specifi c enol equivalents can be used to control aldol reactions

In Chapter 25 we saw that the alkylation of enolates was most simply controlled by preparing
a specifi c enol equivalent from the carbonyl compound. The same approach is the most
power ful of all the ways to control the aldol reaction. The table is a reminder of some of the
most useful of these specifi c enol equivalents.

Specifi c enol equivalents are intermediates that still have the reactivity of enols or enolates but are stable enough to be prepared in good yield from the carbonyl compound.
That was all we needed to know in Chapter 25. Now we know that a further threat is the
reaction of the partly formed enol derivative with its unenolized parent and we should
add that ‘no aldol reaction should occur during the preparation of the specifi c enol
equivalent’.



- **Specifi c enol equivalents are intermediates that still have the reactivity of enols or enolates**
**but are stable enough to be prepared in good yield from the carbonyl compound without any**
**aldol reaction.**


Sensible choice of an appropriate specifi c enol equivalent will allow almost any aldol reaction to be performed successfully. The fi rst two compounds in our list, the silyl enol ethers
and the lithium enolates, have a particularly wide application and we should look fi rst at the
way these work. As the table suggests, silyl enol ethers are more like enols: they are non-basic
and not very reactive. Lithium enolates are more like enolate anions: they are basic and reactive. Each is appropriate in different circumstances.

###### Lithium enolates in aldol reactions

Lithium enolates are usually made at low temperature in THF with a hindered lithium amide
base (often LDA) and are stable under those conditions because of the strong O–Li bond. The
formation of the enolate begins with Li–O bond formation before the removal of the proton
from the position by the basic nitrogen atom.

Now, if a second carbonyl compound is added, it too complexes with the same lithium
atom. This allows the aldol reaction to take place by a cyclic mechanism in the coordination
sphere of the lithium atom. The aldol step itself is now a very favourable intramolecular reaction with a six-membered cyclic transition state. The product is initially the lithium alkoxide
of the aldol, which gives the aldol on work-up.



- Aldehydes are an exception.
You can make lithium enolates
from some aldehydes such as
i-PrCHO, but generally selfcondensation is too fast, so
unwanted aldol selfcondensation products are
produced during the formation
of the lithium enolate. To make
specifi c enolates of aldehydes
we need to use another type of
derivative: see later.

This reaction works well even if the electrophilic partner is an enolizable aldehyde. In this
example, an unsymmetrical ketone (blocked on one side by an aromatic ring) reacts as the
enol partner in excellent yield with a very enolizable aldehyde. This is the fi rst complete aldol
reaction we have shown you using a specifi c enol equivalent: notice the important point that
it is done in two steps:

 - fi rst, form the specifi c enol equivalent (here, the lithium enolate at low temperature)

 - _then add the electrophile._



- A lithium cation has four
coordination sites—those we do
not show are occupied by
solvent molecules. Before the
aldol reaction can take place,
one of these molecules must be
displaced by the electrophilic
carbonyl partner.

Contrast the crossed aldols earlier in the chapter, where enolizable component, base, and

The next example is particularly impressive. The enol partner is a symmetrical ketone that
is very hindered—there is only one hydrogen on either side. The electrophilic partner is a
conjugated enal that is not enolizable but that might accept the nucleophile in a conjugate
manner. In spite of these potential problems, the reaction goes in excellent yield.

You may wonder why we did not mention the stereochemistry of the fi rst of these two
products. Two new stereogenic centres are formed and the product is a mixture of diastereo i somers. In fact, both of these products were wanted for oxidation to the 1,3-diketone so the
stereochemistry is irrelevant. This sequence shows that the aldol reaction can be used to
make diketones too.

###### Silyl enol ethers in aldol reactions

The silyl enol ether can be prepared from its parent carbonyl compound by forming a small
equilibrium concentration of enolate ion with weak base such as a tertiary amine and trapping the enolate with the very effi cient oxygen electrophile Me3SiCl. The silyl enol ether is
stable enough to be isolated but is usually used immediately without storing.
You should look upon silyl enol ethers as rather reactive alkenes that combine with things
like protons or bromine (Chapter 20), but do not react with aldehydes and ketones without
catalysis: they are much less reactive than lithium enolates. As with alkylation (pp. 595 and
609), a Lewis acid catalyst is needed to get the aldol reaction to work, and a Ti(IV) compound
such as TiCl4 is popular.

The immediate product is actually the silyl ether of the aldol product but this is hydrolysed

Now the aldol reaction can occur: the positive charge on the titanium-complexed carbonyl
oxygen atom makes the aldehyde reactive enough to be attacked even by the not very nucleophilic silyl enol ether. Chloride ion removes the silyl group and the titanium alkoxide

This mechanism looks complicated, and it is. It is, in fact, not clear that the details of what
we have written here are right: the titanium may well coordinate to both oxygens throughout
the reaction, and some of the steps that we have represented separately probably happen
simultaneously. However, all reasonable mechanisms will agree on two important points,
which you must understand:

 - Lewis acid is needed to get silyl enol ethers to react.

 - The key step is an aldol reaction of the silyl enol ether with the Lewis-acid complexed
electrophile.

The use of silyl enol ethers can be illustrated in a synthesis of manicone, a conjugated enone
that ants use to leave a trail to a food source. It can be made by an aldol reaction between
pentan-3-one (as the enol component) and 2-methylbutanal (as the electrophile). Both partners are enolizable so we shall need to form a specifi c enol equivalent from the ketone. The
silyl enol ether works well. The aldol product will be a mixture of diastereoisomers but it
eliminates to give a single compound.

The silyl enol ether is not isolated but is treated immediately with the aldehyde to give an
excellent yield of the aldol. Dehydration in acid solution with toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH)
gives the enone. You can see by the high yield in the aldol reaction that there is no signifi cant
self-condensation of either partner in the aldol reaction.

###### Conjugated Wittig reagents as specifi c enol equivalents

When the Wittig reaction was introduced (Chapter 11) we saw it simply as an alkene synthesis. Now if we look at one group of Wittig reagents, those derived from α-halo-carbonyl
compounds, we can see that they behave as specifi c enol equivalents in making unsaturated
carbonyl compounds.

You notice that we have drawn the intermediate ylid as an enolate just to emphasize that it
is an enolate derivative: it can also be represented either as the ylid or as an equivalent C=P
‘phosphorane’ structure. If we look at the details of this sort of Wittig reaction, we shall see
that ylid formation is like enolate anion formation (indeed it _is enolate anion formation)._
Only a weak base is needed as the enolate is stabilized by the Ph3P[+] group as well.

The fi nal stages follow the mechanism of the Wittig reaction you met in Chapter 11: you can
now see them as a special case of dehydration of an ‘aldol’ made favourable by the formation
of a phosphine oxide and an unsaturated carbonyl compound.
The conjugated ylides derived from aldehydes, ketones, and esters are all suffi ciently stable
to be commercially available as the ylids—one of the few examples of specifi c enolate equivalents that you can actually buy. The ylid corresponding to the enolate of acetaldehyde is a
solid, m.p. 185–188°C, that reacts well with other aldehydes, even if they are enolizable.

The stability of the phosphonium-stabilized enolates also means that, although they react
well with aldehydes, their reactions with ketones are often poor, and it is better in these cases
to use phosphonate-stabilized enolates. Being anionic, rather than neutral, these enolates are
more nucleophilic. If an ester enolate equivalent is being used, the best base is the alkoxide ion
belonging to the ester; with a ketone enolate equivalent, use sodium hydride or an alkoxide.

enolate) and by the adjacent P=O group, are just one of many examples of enolate anions
stabilized by two electron-withdrawing groups. The most important members of this class,
enolates of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, are the subject of the next section.

###### Specifi c enol equivalents from 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds

Although these are the oldest of the specifi c enol equivalents, they are still widely used
because they need no special conditions—no low temperatures or strictly anhydrous solvents.
The two most important are derived from malonic acid and ethyl acetoacetate.

Ethyl acetoacetate is partly enolized under normal conditions. So, you might ask, why
doesn’t it immediately react with itself by the aldol reaction? There are two aspects to the
answer. First, the enol is very stable (see Chapter 20 for a full discussion) and, second, the
carbonyl groups in the unenolized fraction of the sample are poorly electrophilic ester and
ketone groups. The second carbonyl group of the enol is not electrophilic because of conjugation. When a normal carbonyl compound is treated with catalytic acid or base, we have a
small proportion of reactive enol or enolate in the presence of large amounts of unenolized
electrophile. Aldol reaction (self-condensation) occurs. With 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds we
have a small proportion of not particularly reactive unenolized compound in the presence of
large amounts of stable (and hence unreactive) enol. No aldol occurs.
If we want a crossed aldol reaction with a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound, we simply add a second, electrophilic carbonyl compound such as an aldehyde, along with a weak acid or base.
Often a mixture of a secondary amine and a carboxylic acid is used.

- The aldol condensation of
1,3-dicarbonyl compounds
under these conditions is
sometimes called the
**Knoevenagel reaction after**
its nineteenth century inventor.


Reaction no doubt occurs via the enolate ion generated by the amine while the carboxylic
acid buffers the solution, neutralizing the product and preventing enolization of the aldehyde. The amine (pKa R2NH2+ about 10) is a strong enough base to form a signifi cant concentration of enolate from the 1,3-dicarbonyl compound (pKa about 13) but not strong enough to
form the enolate from the aldehyde (pKa about 20). The formation of the enolate can be drawn
from either tautomer of the malonate.


Tautomers are isomers related
to one another by tautomerism:

You may not want a product with both ester groups present, and we discussed in Chapter 25
how one of two 1,3-related ester groups may be removed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation.
There is a simpler route with the aldol reaction. If, instead of the malonate diester, malonic
_acid is used, the decarboxylation occurs spontaneously during the reaction. The catalysts this_
time are usually a more basic mixture of piperidine and pyridine.

In the fi rst part of this chapter we have looked at general solutions to the problem of controlling crossed aldol reactions. We’ll now turn to the detailed ways those solutions are used with
different classes of enolizable compounds.


-----

###### How to control aldol reactions of esters

Among the enolates of carboxylic acid derivatives, esters are the most widely used. Ester enolates cannot be used as such in crossed aldols with aldehydes because the aldehyde is both
more enolizable and more electrophilic than the ester. It will just condense with itself and
ignore the ester. The same is true for ketones. A specifi c enol equivalent for the ester will therefore be needed for a successful aldol reaction of an ester enolate.
Fortunately, because this is a classic problem, many solutions are available. You can use the
lithium enolate or the silyl enol ether, usually made best via the lithium enolate.



- We have already discussed
the special examples of
malonate and phosphonoacetate
esters above. Now we need to
consider ester enolates more
generally.

A good example is the fi rst step in a synthesis of the natural product himalchene by Oppolzer
and Snowden. Even though the ester and the aldehyde are both crowded with substituents,
the aldol reaction works well with the lithium enolate of the ester. The cyclic mechanism
ensures that the enolate adds directly to the carbonyl group of the aldehyde and not in a
conjugate (Michael) fashion.

There is no danger of self-condensation with zinc enolates as they do not react with esters.
But they do react cleanly with aldehydes and ketones to give aldols on work-up. You will
appreciate that the use of zinc enolates is therefore special to esters: you cannot make a
zinc enolate from a 2-bromoaldehyde or an α-bromoketone as then you _would get self-_
condensation.

reactions.

starting material for the ylid
synthesis.


-----

###### How to control aldol reactions of aldehydes

Aldehydes enolize very readily but also self-condense rather easily. Lithium enolates of aldehydes can’t be made cleanly because the self-condensation reaction happens even at –78 °C
and is as fast as the enolization by LDA. Silyl enol ethers are a much better choice. They clearly
must not be made via the lithium enolate, and amine bases are usually used. As each molecule
of enolate is produced in the equilibrium, it is effi ciently trapped by the silylating agent.

These silyl enol ethers are probably the best way of carrying out crossed aldol reactions with
an aldehyde as the nucleophilic (enol or enolate) partner. An example is the reaction of the
enol of the not very enolizable isobutyraldehyde with the very enolizable 3-phenylpropanal.
Mixing the two aldehydes and adding base would of course lead to an orgy of self-condensation and cross-couplings.
Preliminary formation of the silyl enol ether from either aldehyde, in the absence of the other,
would be trouble-free as Me3SiCl captures the enolate faster than self-condensation occurs.
Here we need the silyl enol ether from isobutyraldehyde. The other aldehyde is now added
along with the necessary Lewis acid, here TiCl4. The mechanism described on p. 627 gives the
aldol after work-up in an excellent 95% yield. No more than 5% of other reactions can have
occurred.

Other useful specifi c enol equivalents of aldehydes and ketones are enamines and aza-enolates, which you saw in use in alkylation reactions in Chapter 25. Aza-enolates—the lithium
enolates of imines—derived from aldehydes are also useful in aldol reactions. Cyclohexylamine
gives a reasonably stable imine even with acetaldehyde and this can be isolated and lithiated
with LDA to give the aza-enolate. The mechanism is similar to the formation of lithium enolates and the lithium atom binds the nitrogen atom of the aza-enolate, just as it binds the
oxygen atom of an enolate.

you should ensure you are

imine formation and hydrolysis
from Chapter 11.

The key to the success of the aza-enolates is that the imine is fi rst formed from the aldehyde
with the primary amine, a relatively weak base, and under these conditions imine formation
is faster than self-condensation. Only after the imine is formed is LDA added when selfcondensation cannot occur simply because no aldehyde is left.
Except in certain cases (and you will meet some of these in Chapter 41) enamines are not
generally used in aldol condensations, partly because they are not reactive enough, but
mainly because they are too much in equilibrium with the carbonyl compound itself and
exchange would lead to self-condensation and the wrong cross-couplings. You will see later
that enamines come into their own when we want to acylate enols with the much more reactive acid chlorides.

###### How to control aldol reactions of ketones

The enolization of ketones, unless they are symmetrical, poses a special problem. Not only do
we need to prevent them self-condensing (although this is less of a problem than with aldehydes), but we also need to control which side of the carbonyl group the ketone enolizes. In
this section we shall introduce aldol reactions with unsymmetrical ketones where one of two
possible enols or enolates must be made.

###### Making the less substituted enolate equivalent: kinetic enolates

Treatment of methyl ketones with LDA usually gives only the lithium enolate on the methyl
side. This is the enolate that forms the fastest and is therefore known as the kinetic enolate. It
is formed faster because:

 - the protons on the methyl group are more acidic

 - there are three of them as against two on the other side, and

 - there is steric hindrance to attack by LDA on the other side of the carbonyl group.

Aldol reactions can be carried out with either the lithium enolate or the silyl enol ether.
As an example we shall use the synthesis of a component of the fl avour of ginger. The hotness of ginger comes from ‘gingerol’—the ‘pungent principle’ of ginger. Gingerol is a
3-hydroxyketone, so we might consider using an aldol reaction to make it. We shall need
the enol (or enolate) on the methyl side of an unsymmetrical ketone to react with a simple
aldehyde (pentanal) as the electrophilic partner in the aldol reaction. Pentanal is an enolizable aldehyde, so we must stop it enolizing. The diagram summarizes the proposed aldol
reaction.

We might consider using the lithium enolate or the silyl enol ether. As we need the kinetic
enolate (the enolate formed on the less substituted side of the ketone), we shall be using the
lithium enolate to make the silyl enol ether, so it would make sense to try that fi rst. There is
another problem too. The ketone has a free OH group on the far side of the ring that will interfere with the reaction. We must protect that fi rst as an ordinary silyl ether (not a silyl enol ether).

###### Making the more substituted enolate equivalent: thermodynamic enolates

Being an alkene, an enol or enolate is more stable if it has more substituents. So the way to
make the more substituted enolate equivalent is to make it under conditions where the two
enolates can interconvert: equilibration will give the more stable form. You have seen in
Chapter 25 (p. 599) how the silyl enol ether on the more substituted side of a ketone can be
made by treating the ketone with Me3SiCl and a weak base, but these thermodynamic silyl
enol ethers have been little used in aldol reactions. One successful example is the thermodynamic silyl enol ether of 1-phenylpropan-2-one: enolization on the conjugated side is overwhelmingly favoured thermodynamically. The aldol reaction with a 2-ketoaldehyde goes
exclusively for the more reactive aldehyde group.

This concludes our general survey of specifi c enolates in the aldol reaction. Later you will
see many of the same reagents used in acylation at carbon. We are left with some reactions
that are particularly easy to do.

###### Intramolecular aldol reactions

Now for something easy. When an aldol reaction can form a fi ve- or six-membered ring, you
need no longer worry about specifi c enols or anything like that. Equilibrium methods with
weak acids or bases are quite enough to give the cyclic product by an intramolecular aldol
reaction because intramolecular reactions are faster than intermolecular ones. We shall
illustrate intramolecular reactions by looking at the cyclization of a series of diketones of
increasing complexity, starting with one that can form four equivalent enols: cyclodeca1,6-dione.
It doesn’t matter where enolization occurs because the same enol is formed. And once the
enol is formed, there is only one thing it can reasonably do: attack the other ketone to form a
stable fi ve-membered ring. It also gives a reasonably stable seven-membered ring, but that is by
the way. In weak acid or base, only a small proportion of carbonyl groups will be enolized, so
the chance of two being in the same molecule is very low. No intermolecular condensation is
found and the yield of the bicyclic enone from the intramolecular reaction is almost 100%
(96% with Na2CO3).

This may look like a long stretch for the enol to reach across the ten-membered ring
to reach the other ketone, but the conformational drawing in the margin shows just
how close they can be. You should compare this conformation with that of a decalin
(Chapter 16).
The key point to remember with intramolecular aldols is this:

One enol can cyclize through an eight-membered cyclic transition state and the other

would dehydrate to the cyclic enone having the same ring size as the transition state. In
practice, only the less strained six-membered ring is formed and the enone can be isolated in
85% yield.

Most diketones lack symmetry, and will potentially have four different sites for enolization. Consider what might happen when this diketone is treated with KOH. There are four
different places where an enolate anion might be formed as there are four different carbon
atoms. There are also two different electrophilic carbonyl groups so that there are many
possibilities for inter- and intramolecular condensation. Yet only one product is formed, in
90% yield.

We can deduce the mechanism of the reaction simply from the structure of the product by
working backwards. The double bond is formed from an aldol whose structure we can predict
and hence we can see which enolate anion was formed and which ketone acted as the electrophilic partner.

Must we argue that this one enolate is more easily formed than the other three? No, of course
not. There is little difference between all four enolates and almost no difference between the
three enolates from CH2 groups. We can argue that this is the only aldol reaction that leads to
a stable conjugated enone in a stable six-membered ring. This must be the mechanism; the
others are just too slow to compete. Protonation and dehydration follow as usual.

Now try some of the alternatives in which the same ketone forms an enolate on the other
side. These reactions give unstable four-membered rings or bridged bicyclic systems that would
revert to the enolate. Providing the reaction is done under equilibrating conditions, the whole
process would go into reverse back to the original diketone and the observed (six-membered
ring) cyclization would eventually predominate. The key point about the bridged compound
in the margin is that dehydration is impossible. No enolate can form at the bridgehead because
bridgehead carbons cannot be planar (Chapter 17, p. 389) and the enone product cannot exist
for the same reason: the carbons marked (•) in the brown structure would all have to lie in the
same plane. The aldol has a perfectly acceptable conformation but that elimination is impossible. The aldol product remains in equilibrium with the alternative aldol products, but only
one elimination is possible—and that is irreversible, so eventually all the material ends up as
the one enone.

###### The Robinson annelation

One of the most important applications of the intramolecular aldol reaction is a ring synthesis
(annelation or annulation) that takes place in two steps, both involving enols. The compound
made by Robinson in the fi rst example is a bicyclic diketone that contains the basic structure
of rings A and B of the steroids. The bonds made in the two steps are marked.

Other ways to carry out this same reaction are to use a secondary amine as the weak base. This

###### The Darzens reaction

Tandem reactions, in which a second enolate reaction follows on from the fi rst, can allow us
to make cyclopropanes (see Chapter 25, p. 586), by conjugate addition followed by C-alkylation,
or epoxides, by aldol addition followed by O-alkylation. This epoxide was used in the synthesis of the drug Darusentan.

The formation of epoxides in this way complements their formation from alkenes with

###### Acylation at carbon

 Introduction: the Claisen ester condensation and the aldol reaction compared

We began this chapter with the treatment of acetaldehyde with base. This led initially to the
formation of an enolate anion and then to the aldol reaction. We are going to start this section
by looking at what happens if you just treat ethyl acetate with base. To start with, there is
hardly any difference. We shall use ethoxide as base rather than hydroxide as hydroxide
would hydrolyse the ester, but otherwise the fi rst steps are very similar. Here they are, side
by side.

The next step in both cases is nucleophilic attack by the enolate ion on unenolized carbonyl
compound. The concentration of enolate is low and each enolate ion is surrounded by
un enolized aldehyde or ester molecules, so this reaction is to be expected. Here is that step,
again shown for both aldehyde and ester.

Only now does something different happen. The aldehyde dimer simply captures a proton
from the solvent to give an aldol product. The ‘aldol’ from the ester (not, in fact, an aldol at
all) has a leaving group, EtO[−], instead of a hydrogen atom and is actually the tetrahedral intermediate in a nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group. Compare the two different steps
again.

Even though the last step is different, the two products are quite similar. Both are dimers of
the original two-carbon chain and both have carbonyl groups at the end of the chain and
oxygen substituents at position three. The two reactions obviously belong to the same family
but are usually given different names. The ester reaction is sometimes known as the Claisen
**ester condensation and sometimes as the Claisen–Schmidt reaction. More important than**
remembering the name is being familiar with the reaction and its mechanism.


-----

This is another of those reactions where the base is not strong enough to transform the ester
entirely into the enolate. Only a small equilibrium concentration is produced, which reacts
with the ester electrophile. The by-product from the reaction is ethoxide ion and so it looks at
fi rst sight as though we get our catalyst back again—the aldol, if you remember, is catalytic in
base. But not the Claisen reaction. The second step of the reaction is also really an equilibrium, and the reaction works only because the product can be irreversibly deprotonated by
the ethoxide by-product, consuming ethoxide in the process. You recall that the aldol reaction often works best when there is an extra driving force to push it across—dehydration to
an enone, for example. Similarly, the ester dimerization works best when the product reacts
with the ethoxide ion to give a stable enolate ion.

The point is that the base used, ethoxide ion EtO[−], is too weak (EtOH has a pKa of about 16)
to remove the proton completely from ethyl acetate (pKa about 25), but is strong enough to
remove a proton from the acetoacetate product (pKa about 10). Under the conditions of the
reaction, a small amount of the enolate of ethyl acetate is produced—just enough to let the
reaction happen—but the product is completely converted into its enolate. The neutral product, ethyl acetoacetate itself, is formed on acidic work-up.

The fi nal product has been formed by the acylation at carbon of the enolate of an ester. This
general process—acylation at carbon—is the subject of the second part of this chapter. It so
happened in this case that the acylating agent was another molecule of the same ester, but the
general process we shall consider is the acylation of enolates at carbon. We shall use a variety
of enols, enolates, and specifi c enol equivalents and a variety of acylating agents, but the basic
idea is that the enolate of one carbonyl compound will have an acyl group (here the R[2]CO
group in orange) added to the enolate carbon atom.

###### Problems with acylation at carbon


X = a leaving group new C–C bond


The main problem with the acylation of enolates is that reaction tends to occur at oxygen
rather than at carbon.



- You have seen reaction at
oxygen before. Enolates react on
oxygen with silicon electrophiles
and we found the products, silyl
enol ethers, useful in further
reactions. Enol esters also have
their uses—as precursors of
lithium enolates, for example.
You saw one being used like
this on p. 454.

The product of acylation on oxygen is an enol ester. The tendency to attack through oxygen
is most marked with reactive enolates and reactive acylating agents. The combination of a
lithium enolate and an acid chloride, for example, is pretty certain to give an enol ester.

If we want acylation at carbon we must use either:

  - less reactive specifi c enol equivalents, such as enamines or silyl enol ethers, with
reactive acylating agents such as acid chlorides or

  - reactive enols, such as the enolate anions themselves, with less reactive acylating
agents such as esters.

We introduced this chapter with an example of the second type of reaction, and we shall
continue with a more detailed consideration of the Claisen ester condensation and related
reactions.

###### Reaction at oxygen—not a problem in the aldol reaction

Earlier in this chapter, we mentioned no trouble with reaction at oxygen in the aldol reaction. This may now seem surprising,
in view of what we have said about esters, as the electrophiles were aldehydes and ketones—not so very different from
esters. We can resolve this by looking at what would happen if an aldehyde did attack an enolate on the oxygen atom.

The only plausible leaving group from the intermediate is the enolate oxygen: the reaction just reverses.

###### The Claisen ester condensation and other self-condensations

The self-condensation of ethyl acetate is the most famous example of the Claisen ester condensation and it works in good yield under convenient conditions. The product (ethyl acetoacetate) is commercially available for this very reason—and cheap too—so you are unlikely to
want to do this particular example.
A more generally useful reaction is the self-condensation of simple substituted acetates
RCH2CO2Et. These work well under the same conditions (EtO[−] in EtOH). The enolate anion is
formed fi rst in low concentration and in equilibrium with the ester. It then carries out a
nucleophilic attack on the more abundant unenolized ester molecules.

These steps are all unfavourable equilibria and, on their own, would give very little product.
However, as we mentioned before, the reaction works because the equilibrium is driven over
by the essentially irreversible formation of a stable, delocalized enolate from the product.

Finally, the reaction is worked up in acid and the β keto-ester product is formed. Notice that
all products of Claisen ester condensations have a 1,3-dicarbonyl relationship. These compounds are useful in the preparation of specifi c enol equivalents and you have seen them in
action in Chapters 20 and 25, and in this chapter.

###### How do we know that deprotonation drives the reaction?

If the original ester has two substituents on the α carbon atom (C2 of the ester), the formation
of the stable enolate of the product is no longer possible as there are no hydrogen atoms left
to remove.

As you might expect, all the equilibria are now unfavourable, and this reaction does not
go well under the normal equilibrating conditions (EtO[−] in EtOH). It can be made to go in
reasonable yield if a stronger base is used. Traditionally, triphenylmethyl sodium is chosen.
This is made from Ph3CCl and sodium metal, and is a very conjugated carbanion.
Triphenylmethyl carbanion is a strong enough base to convert an ester entirely into its
enolate. Reaction of the enolate with a second molecule of ester then gives the keto-ester in
good yield.

###### Crossed ester condensations

Much the same arguments apply here as applied in the crossed aldol reaction. We must be
quite sure that we know which compound is going to act as the enol partner and which as the
acylation partner.

###### Reactive esters that cannot enolize

There are several useful esters of this kind, of which the four in the margin are the
most important. They cannot act as the enol partner, and the fi rst three are more electrophilic than most esters, so they should acylate an ester enolate faster than the ester being
enolized can.
These four are arranged in order of reactivity towards nuclophiles, the most electrophilic at
the top and the least electrophilic at the bottom. Oxalates are very reactive because each carbonyl group makes the other more electrophilic. The molecular LUMO is the sum of the two
π* orbitals and is lower in energy than either.

Formate esters look a bit like aldehydes but their ester character dominates. The hydrogen
atom just makes them very electrophilic as they lack the σ conjugation (and steric hindrance)
of simple esters.
Carbonates are particularly useful as they introduce a CO2R group on to an enolate. It is perhaps not immediately obvious why they are more electrophilic than simple esters. Normal
esters are (slightly) less electrophilic than ketones because the deactivating lone pair donation
by the oxygen atom is more important than the inductive effect of the electronegative oxygen
atom.

The result is a small difference between two large effects. In carbonate esters there are two
oxygen atoms on the same carbonyl group. Both can exert their full inductive effect but the
lone pairs have to share the same π* orbital. The balance is changed—the summed inductive
effects win out—and carbonates are more electrophilic than ordinary esters.

###### Crossed Claisen ester condensations between two different esters

To illustrate some Claisen reactions which are easy to do, we shall now give a few examples of
crossed Claisen ester condensations between ordinary esters and the compounds we have just
discussed. First, a reaction between a simple linear ester and diethyl oxalate performed under
equilibrating conditions with ethoxide as the base. The weak base means a lower enolate
concentration.

Another important example leads to the preparation of diethyl phenylmalonate. This compound cannot be made by ‘alkylation’ of diethyl malonate as aryl halides do not undergo
nucleophilic substitution (Chapter 22).
A crossed Claisen ester condensation between very enolizable ethyl phenylacetate and
un enolizable but electrophilic diethyl carbonate works very well indeed under equilibrating
conditions.

###### Claisen condensations between ketones and esters

Claisen condensations are acylations that always involve esters as the electrophilic partner,
but enolates of other carbonyl compounds—ketones, for example—may work equally well as
the enol partner. In a reaction with a carbonate, only the ketone can enolize and the reactive
carbonate ester is more electrophilic than another molecule of the ketone. A good example is
this reaction of cyclooctanone. It does not matter which side of the carbonyl group enolizes—
they are both the same.

Unsymmetrical ketones often give a single product, even without the use of a specifi c enol
equivalent, as reaction usually occurs on the less substituted side. This is another consequence of the fi nal enolization being the irreversible step. In this example, both possible
products may form, but only one of them can form a stable enolate. Under the equilibrating
conditions of the reaction, only the enolate is stable, and all the material ends up as the isomer shown.

Even when both enolates can form, the less substituted dicarbonyl enolate is preferred

Diethyl oxalate also gives well-controlled condensations with ketones and we shall take the
synthesis of a new drug as an example. One way to try to prevent heart disease is to reduce the
amount of ‘bad’ lipoproteins in the blood. The drug Acifran does this, and a key step in its
synthesis is the base-catalysed reaction between diethyl oxalate and a methyl ketone.

Notice that the hydroxyl group on the ketone does not interfere with the reaction. No doubt
the fi rst molecule of base removes the OH proton and the second molecule forms the enolate
(the only possible enolate in either molecule). Fast condensation with highly electrophilic

###### Summary of the preparation of keto-esters by the Claisen reaction

It is worth pausing at this moment to summarize which keto-esters can be made easily by the
two methods we have discussed, namely

 - Claisen ester condensation

 - acylation of ketones with carbonates.

Ethyl acetoacetate (ethyl 3-oxobutyrate) can of course be made by the self-condensation of
ethyl acetate. This ester is cheap to buy but homologues, available by the self-condensation of
other esters, are usually made in the laboratory. Which esterifying group is used (OEt, OMe,
etc.) is not important as long as the same alkoxide is used as the base.

Compounds with only one of the R substituents in this structure are also easy to make. If
the R substituent is at C2, it is best introduced by alkylation of the unsubstituted ester (see
Chapter 25, p. 595).

Attempts to make this compound by the Claisen ester condensation would require one of
the approaches in the diagram below. The dashed curly arrows suggest the general direction

reaction worked.

But neither reaction will work! The black route requires a controlled condensation between
two different enolizable esters—a recipe for a mixture of products. The simple alkylation route
above removes the need for control. The green route requires a condensation between an
unsymmetrical ketone and diethyl carbonate. This condensation will work all right, but not to
give this product. As you saw on p. 645, Claisen condensations prefer to give the less substituted dicarbonyl compound, and condensation would occur at the methyl group of the ketone
on the right to give the other unsymmetrical keto-ester. So this isomer can be made easily too.

###### Controlling acylation with specifi c enol equivalents

In the fi rst part of this chapter we saw how specifi c enol equivalents could be used to control
aldol reactions. We now need to look at the same type of control in the acylation of enolates
and extend our discussion to specifi c enolates of carboxylic acid derivatives.
We established in Chapter 10 a hierarchy for the electrophilic reactivity of acid derivatives
that should by now be very familiar to you—acyl chlorides at the top to amides at the bottom.
But what about the reactivity of these same derivatives towards enolization at the position, that
is, the CH2 group between R and the carbonyl group in the various structures? You might by
now be able to work this out. The principle is based on the mechanisms for the two processes.

See how similar these two mechanisms are. In particular, they are the same at the carbonyl
group itself. Electrons move into the C=O π* orbital: the C=O bond becomes a C–O single
bond as a negative charge develops on the oxygen atom. It should come as no surprise that the
_order of reactivity for enolization is the same as the order of reactivity towards nucleophilic attack._
Aldehydes are more electrophilic and more easily enolized than ketones and ketones are more
electrophilic and more easily enolized than esters, although exact comparisons between aldehydes and ketones on the one hand and acid derivatives on the other are unwise.
In Chapter 20 we established that enolates can be formed from acid chlorides, but that they
decompose to ketenes. Enolates can be formed from amides with diffi culty, but with primary
or secondary amides one of the NH protons is likely to be removed instead. For the remainder
of this section we shall look at how to make specifi c enol equivalents of acids, esters, aldehydes, and ketones.

###### Directed C-acylation of esters

The danger we have to face is that acylation is inclined to occur on oxygen rather than on
carbon. In the extreme case, naked enolates (those with completely non-coordinating cations) acylate cleanly on oxygen with anhydrides or acid chlorides.

Fortunately, the reagents we have just discussed for aldol reactions (lithium and zinc enolates) are also acylated at carbon rather than on oxygen. Even with acid chlorides magnesium
enolates, particularly those of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, give reliable C-acylation. The magnesium atom bonds strongly to both oxygens, lessening their effective negative charge.

Hydrolysis and decarboxylation in the usual way lead to keto-esters or keto-acids. Of the
more common metals used to form enolates, lithium is the most likely to give good C-acylation
as, like magnesium, it forms a strong O–metal bond. It is possible to acylate simple lithium
enolates with enolizable acid chlorides.

We shall describe two examples of this reaction being used as part of the synthesis of nat ural
products. The fi rst is pallescensin A, a metabolite of a sponge. It is quite a simple compound
and some chemists in Milan conceived that it might be made from the chloro-diketone shown
below, which might in turn be made by acylation of the enolate of a symmetrical ketone.

The route chosen was to react the lithium enolate of 4-t-butyl cyclohexanone with the correct acid chloride. This reaction worked well, as did the rest of the synthesis of pallescensin A,
which was fi rst made by this route. The key step, the acylation of the lithium enolate, is interesting because alkylation could have occurred instead. The acid chloride is more electrophilic
than the alkyl chloride in this reaction, although alkylation does occur in the next step.
Notice how the lithium atom holds the molecules together during the reaction.

Even the dilithio derivatives of carboxylic acids, made by treating a carboxylic acid with two
molecules of LDA, can give good reactions with acid chlorides. In these reactions it is not
necessary to have a proton remaining between the two carbonyl groups of the product as the
reaction is between a strong nucleophile and a strong electrophile and is under kinetic
control.

It is rather more common to use enamines or silyl enol ethers in acylations with acid chlorides. These are more general methods—enamines work well for aldehydes and ketones while
silyl enol ethers work for all classes of carbonyl compounds. It is possible to combine two
enolizable molecules quite specifi cally by these methods, and we shall consider them next.

###### The acylation of ketones via enamines and aza-enolates

Enamines are made from secondary amines and aldehydes or ketones via the iminium salt:
you met them in Chapter 11 and have seen them in action in Chapters 20 and 25. In Chapter
25 we saw that reliable _C-alkylation of enamines occurs with reactive allyl halides and_


enamine


-----

α-halocarbonyl compounds, but that unwanted _N-alkylation often competes with simple_
alkyl halides. We also noted earlier in this chapter that they are rarely used for aldol reactions
as they are not reactive enough.

Acylation with the much more reactive acid chlorides could follow the same two pathways,
but with one big difference. The products of N-acylation are unstable salts and N-acylation is
reversible. Acylation on carbon, on the other hand, is irreversible. For this reason enamines
end up acylated reliably on carbon.

The Swiss chemist Oppolzer used just such a reaction in a synthesis of the natural product
longifolene. He fi rst prepared an acid chloride from cyclopentadiene, and the enamine from
cyclopentanone and the secondary amine morpholine.

Aza-enolates also react cleanly at carbon with acid chlorides. Good examples come from
dimethylhydrazones of ketones. When the ketone is unsymmetrical, the aza-enolate forms
on the less substituted side, even when the distinction is between primary and secondary
carbons. The best of our previous regioselective acylations have distinguished only methyl
from more highly substituted carbon atoms.

You will not be surprised to fi nd that the immediate product tautomerizes to an acyl-enamine further stabilized by an internal hydrogen bond. Mild acidic work-up releases the diketone
product. The overall procedure may sound complicated—Me2NNH2 then base then acyl
chloride then acidic methanol—but it is performed in a single fl ask and the products, the
1,3-diketones, are formed in excellent yield—in this case 83% overall.



- Hydrazones, as we explained
on p. 232 of Chapter 11, are
much less electrophilic than
ketones. Even BuLi can be used
as a base: it does not attack the
C=N bond.

###### Acylation of ketones under acidic conditions


Acylations of ketone enols with anhydrides are catalysed by Lewis acids such as BF3. This process will remind you of Friedel–Crafts acylation (p. 477) but a better analogy is perhaps the
aldol reaction, where metals such as lithium hold the reagents together so that reaction can
occur around a six-membered ring.

The mechanism obviously involves attack by the enol (or ‘boron enolate’) of the ketone on
the anhydride, catalysed by the Lewis acid. Probably the boron atom holds the reagents
together, much as the lithium atom does in aldol reactions of lithium enolates (p. 625).

You might think that the presence of the acidic proton in a carboxylic acid would present
an insuperable barrier to the formation and use of any enol derivatives. In fact, this is not a
problem with either the lithium enolates or the silyl enol ethers. Addition of BuLi or LDA to
a carboxylic acid immediately results in the removal of the acidic proton and the formation
of the lithium salt of the carboxylic acid. If BuLi is used, the next step is addition of BuLi to
the carbonyl group and the eventual formation of a ketone (see Chapter 10, p. 218). But, if
LDA is used, it is possible to form the lithium enolate of the lithium derivative of the carboxylic acid.

- Silyl enol ethers of acids or

acetals. See p. 609 for more
on this.


The enolate derivative is rather strange as it has two OLi groups on the same double bond,
but it can be cleanly converted to the corresponding silyl enol ether. Both lithium enolates
and silyl enol ethers from acids can be used in aldol reactions.

This concludes our general survey of specifi c enolates in acylation at carbon. We are left
with some reactions that are particularly easy to do.

###### Intramolecular crossed Claisen ester condensations

In the same way as with intramolecular aldol condensations, we do not have to worry so much
about controlling where enolization occurs providing that one product is more stable than
the others—for example, it might have a fi ve- or a six-membered ring (rather than a four- or
eight-membered one)—and we carry out the reaction under equilibrating conditions. A couple of examples should show what we mean. Although there are two sites for enolate anion
formation, one would give a four-membered ring and can be ignored. Only enolization of the
methyl group leads to a stable six-membered ring.

In this next example the two possible sites for enolate anion formation would both lead to
stable fi ve-membered rings. The product forms a stable enolate under the reaction conditions
but the alternative cannot form a stable enolate as there is no hydrogen atom between the two
carbonyl groups.

In the next example, there are three possible sites for enolate anion formation, but only one
product is formed and in good yield too. If we consider all three possible enolate anions, the
choice is more easily made. First, the reaction that does happen. An enolate anion is formed
from the ketone at the green site and acylation at carbon follows. The product is a fused rather
than a bridged bicyclic structure and can easily form a stable enolate anion.

We could form the enolate anion on the other side of the ketone at the orange site and attack
the ester in the same way. The product would be a bridged bicyclic diketone, and is not formed
(see above). The third possible enolate site (brown) could give an aldol reaction but the product would again be a bridged bicyclic compound and is not formed.

###### Symmetry in intramolecular crossed Claisen condensations

If cyclization is to be followed by decarboxylation, a cunning plan can be set in motion.
Addition of an amine by an SN2 reaction to an α halo-ester followed by conjugate addition to
an unsaturated ester gives a substrate for Claisen ester cyclization.

This diester is unsymmetrical so cyclization is likely to lead to two different keto-esters.
Either can form a stable enolate so both are indeed formed. This sounds like very bad news
since it gives a mixture of products.

Just occasionally it is possible to carry out cross-condensations between two different
enolizable molecules under equilibrating conditions. A notable example is the base-catalysed
reaction between methyl ketones and lactones. With sodium hydride—a strong base that can
convert either starting material entirely into its enolate anion—good yields of products from
the attack of the enolate of the ketone on the electrophilic lactone can be obtained.

###### Further reading


Kinetic enolate formation must occur at the methyl group of the ketone followed by acylation with the lactone. Lactones are rather more electrophilic than non-cyclic esters, but the
control in this sequence is still remarkable. Notice how a stable enolate is formed by proton
transfer within the fi rst-formed product.

This chapter concludes a survey of the reactions of carbonyl compounds which started way
back in Chapter 6 with an introduction to addition reactions at the C=O group, and moved
on through the following stages:

Chapter 9: C–C bonds by adding organometallics to C=O

Chapter 10: Substitution at C=O (carboxylic acid derivatives)

Chapter 11: Substitution at C=O with loss of the carbonyl O (acetals, imines, etc.)

Chapter 20: Enols and enolates

Chapter 25: Alkylating enolates

Chapter 26: Adding enols and enolates to C=O groups: the aldol and Claisen reactions

Carbonyl groups are the ‘hooks’ that allow chemists to put molecules together, and in the
chapter after next (Chapter 28) we will discuss how we think about the science of synthesis
using carbonyl reactivity. We will revisit many of the reactions you have seen not just in this
next chapter, but beyond—in particular in the synthesis of heterocycles (Chapter 30) and in
diastereoselective and enantioselective reactions (Chapters 33 and 41).

###### Useful main group elements

Organic chemists make use of most elements in the periodic table: you have already seen
organic compounds of Li, B, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Cu, Br, and I—but that’s only the start.
Three of the most important of these are sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. They all form stable
organic compounds and play nearly as important roles in organic chemistry as oxygen, nitrogen, and the halogens. They are second row elements, coming immediately below carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen, to which they have some similarity. Electronegativity (shown in the
margin) diminishes from right to left and downwards.
The main difference from C, N, and O is that Si, P, and S can form more bonds than the fi rst
row elements. This is because they have more orbitals: the fi ve 3d orbitals added to the 3s and
three 3p orbitals. Silicon forms tetrahedral silanes, rather like alkanes, but also forms stable fi vevalent anions. Phosphorus forms phosphines, rather like amines, but also tetrahedral phosphine oxides. Sulfur can have any coordination number from zero to seven, forming sulfi des,
like ethers, and tetrahedral sulfones with six bonds to sulfur. And it is with sulfur that we start.

use a uniform spelling: ‘sulfur’.

###### Some facts about sulfur

Sulfur is a p-block element in group VI (or 16 if you prefer) immediately below oxygen and
between phosphorus and chlorine. It is natural for us to compare sulfur with oxygen but we
will, strangely, compare it with carbon as well.
Sulfur is much less electronegative than oxygen; in fact, it has the same electronegativity as
carbon, so it is no good trying to use the polarization of the C–S bond to explain anything!
It forms reasonably strong bonds to carbon—strong enough for the compounds to be stable
but weak enough for selective cleavage in the presence of the much stronger C–O bonds.
It also forms fairly strong bonds to itself. Elemental crystalline yellow sulfur consists of S8
mol ecules—eight-membered rings of sulfur atoms.
Because sulfur is in the second row of the periodic table it forms many types of compounds
not available to oxygen. Compounds with S–S and S–halogen bonds are quite stable and can
be isolated, unlike the unstable and often explosive O–halogen and O–O compounds. Sulfur’s
d orbitals allow it to have oxidation states of 0, 2, 4, or 6 and coordination numbers from 0 to
7. Here is a selection of compounds.

Compounds of sulfur

As well as this variety of oxidation states, sulfur shows a sometimes surprising versatility
in function. Simple S(II) compounds are good nucleophiles, as you would expect from the

This ‘hard or soft’ nature of
nucleophiles is discussed with SN2
reactions in general in Chapter 15.


Thiols (RSH) are more acidic than alcohols so the fi rst step is a rapid proton exchange
between the thiol and hydroxide ion. The thiolate anion then carries out a very effi cient SN2
displacement on the alkyl bromide to give the sulfi de. Notice that the thiolate anion does
not attack the carbonyl group. Small basic oxyanions have high charge density and lowenergy fi lled orbitals—they are hard nucleophiles that prefer to attack protons and carbonyl
groups. Large, less basic thiolate anions have high-energy fi lled orbitals and are soft nucleophiles. They prefer to attack saturated carbon atoms. Thiols and thiolates are good soft
nucleophiles.



- **Thiols (RSH) are more acidic than alcohols (ROH) but sulfur compounds are better nucleophiles**
**than oxygen compounds towards saturated carbon atoms (SN2).**



- Thionyl chloride SOCl2 is
electrophilic at sulfur but sulfuryl
chloride SO2Cl2 is electrophilic at
chlorine. Contradictory again!


They are also good soft electrophiles. Sulfenyl chlorides (RSCl) are easily made from
disulfi des (RS–SR) and sulfuryl chloride (SO2Cl2). This S(VI) chloride has electrophilic
chlorine atoms and is attacked by the nucleophilic disulfi de to give two molecules of RSCl
and gaseous SO2. There’s a lot of sulfur chemistry here! We start with a nucleophilic attack
by one sulfur atom of the disulfi de. The intermediate contains a tricoordinate sulfur cation or sulfonium salt. The chloride ion now attacks the other sulfur atom of this intermediate and two molecules of RSCl result. Each atom of the original disulfi de has formed an
S–Cl bond. One sulfur atom was a nucleophile towards chlorine and the other an
electrophile.

The product of this reaction, the sulfenyl chloride, is also a good soft electrophile towards

19. The reaction is stereospecifi c and the product is anti.

At higher oxidation states the compounds become harder electrophiles as the positive
charge on sulfur increases. We have already mentioned tosyl (para-toluenesulfonyl) chloride,
TsCl, as an electrophile for alkoxide ions in this chapter and in earlier chapters.
At this higher oxidation state it might seem unlikely that sulfur could also be a good nucleophile, but consider the result of reacting TsCl with zinc metal. Zinc provides two electrons and
turns the compound into an anion. This anion can also be drawn in two ways.

As this chapter develops you will see other examples of the versatility of sulfur. You will see
that it can be removed from organic compounds in either an oxidative or a reductive fashion,
and you will see that it can stabilize anions or cations on adjacent carbon atoms. The stabilization of anions is the fi rst main section of the chapter.

###### Sulfur-stabilized anions

The stabilization of anions by sulfi des, sulfoxides, and sulfones is a theme that runs right
through this chapter. Sulfur has six electrons in its outer shell. As a sulfi de, therefore, the
sulfur atom carries two lone pairs. In a sulfoxide, one of these lone pairs is used in a bond to
an oxygen atom—sulfoxides can be represented in at least two alternative but equivalent
ways. The sulfur atom in a sulfone uses both of its lone pairs in bonding to oxygen, and is
usually represented with two S=O double bonds.

Treatment of any of these compounds with strong base produces an anion on what was the
methyl group. How does the sulfur stabilize the anion? This question has been the subject of
many debates and we have not got space to go into the details of all of them. There are at least
two factors involved, and the fi rst is evident from this chart of pKa values for protons next to
sulfone, sulfoxide, and sulfi de functional groups.

Clearly, the oxygen atoms are important—the best anion stabilizer is the sulfone, followed
by the sulfoxide and then the sulfi de. You could compare deprotonation of a sulfone with
deprotonation of a ketone to give an enolate (Chapter 20). Enolates have a planar carbon atom
and the anion is mainly on the oxygen atom. Sulfone-stabilized carbanions have two oxygen
atoms and the anionic carbon atom is probably planar, with the negative charge in a p orbital
aligned midway between the S=O bonds.

Yet the attached oxygen atoms cannot be the sole reason for the stability of anions next to
sulfur because even the sulfi de functional group also acidifi es an adjacent proton quite signifi cantly. There is some controversy over exactly why this should be, but the usual explanation is
that polarization of the sulfur’s 3s and 3p electrons (which are more diffuse, and therefore more
polarizable, than the 2s and 2p electrons of oxygen) contributes to the stabilization.

###### Anion stabilization by adjacent sulfur

It was long thought that delocalization into sulfur’s empty 3d orbitals provided the anion stabilization required, but theoretical work in the last 20 years or so suggests this may not be the case. Thus, ab initio calculations suggest that the C–S
bond in −CH2SH is longer than that in CH3SH. The converse would be true if delocalization into the sulfur’s d orbitals
were important. Delocalization would shorten the bond because it would have partial double-bond character. More likely
as an additional factor is delocalization into the σ* orbital of the C–S bond on the other side of the sulfur atom—the
equatorial proton of dithiane (see p. 662 for more on dithiane) is more acidic than the axial one, and the equatorial anion
is more stable because it is delocalized into the C–S bond’s σ* orbital.

###### A sulfoxide-stabilized anion in a synthesis

A sulfoxide alkylation formed the key step of a synthesis of the important vitamin biotin.
Biotin contains a fi ve-membered heterocyclic sulfi de fused to a second fi ve-membered ring,
and the bicyclic skeleton was easy to make from a simple symmetrical ester. The vital step is a
double SN2 reaction on primary carbon atoms.

The next step was to introduce the alkyl chain—this was best done by fi rst oxidizing the
sulfi de to a sulfoxide, using sodium periodate. The sulfoxide was then deprotonated with
_n-BuLi and alkylated with an alkyl iodide containing a carboxylic acid protected as its tert-butyl_
ester. Reduction of the sulfoxide and hydrolysis back to the free acid gave biotin.

In general, thioacetals can be made in a similar way to ‘normal’ (oxygen-based) acetals—by
treatment of an aldehyde or a ketone with a thiol and an acid catalyst—although a Lewis acid
such as BF3 is usually needed rather than a protic acid. The most easily made, most stable
toward hydrolysis, and most reactive towards alkylation are cyclic thioacetals derived from
1,3-propanedithiol, known as dithianes.

Dithianes are extremely important compounds in organic synthesis because _going from_
_carbonyl compound to thioacetal inverts the polarity at the functionalized carbon atom. Aldehydes,_
as you are well aware, are electrophiles at the C=O carbon atom, but dithioacetals, through
deprotonation to an anion, are nucleophilic at this same atom.

Dithianes are rather more stable than acetals, and special reagents have to be used to assist
their hydrolysis and reveal the hidden carbonyl group. Sulfur is less basic than oxygen, so the
protonated species is lower in concentration at a given pH, and the sulfur 3p lone pairs are less
able to form a stable π bond to carbon than are the oxygen 2p lone pairs.

The most obvious solution to this problem is to provide a better electrophile than the proton for sulfur. Mercury, Hg(II), is one solution. Another is oxidation of one sulfur to the sulfoxide. Protonation can now occur on the more basic oxygen atom of the sulfoxide and the
concentration of the vital intermediate is increased.

A third solution is methylation, since sulfur is a better nucleophile than oxygen for saturated carbon. The sulfonium salt can decompose in the same way to give the free aldehyde.
There are many more methods for hydrolysing dithioacetals and their multiplicity should
make you suspicious that none is very good.

Hydrogenation of C–S bonds in both sulfi des and thioacetals is often achieved with Raney
**nickel, the fi nely divided form of nickel made by dissolving away the aluminium from a pow-**
dered nickel–aluminium alloy using alkali. It can be used either as a catalyst for hydrogenation
with gaseous hydrogen or as a reagent since it often contains suffi cient adsorbed hydrogen
(from the reaction of aluminium with alkali) to effect reductions alone. Thioacetalization followed by Raney nickel reduction is a useful way of replacing a C=O group with CH2.



- Thiols are also known as
**mercaptans because of their**
propensity for ‘mercury capture’.



- **Dithianes are ‘acyl anion equivalents’**

**A sequence in which a carbonyl group has been masked as a sulfur derivative, alkylated with an**
**electrophile, and then revealed again is a nucleophilic acylation. These nucleophilic equivalents**
**of carbonyl compounds are known as acyl anion equivalents. In the retrosynthetic terms of**
**Chapter 28 they are d[1] reagents corresponding to the acyl anion synthon.**


###### Anions from sulfones

If the sulfur is at a higher oxidation level, it is much easier to make adjacent anions, and sulfones
excel in this regard. The allylic sulfone we made earlier in the chapter (p. 659) can be deprotonated and added to an unsaturated ester to give a cyclopropane. Notice how much weaker a base
(MeO[−]) is needed here, as the anion is stabilized by sulfone and alkene.

of this sort in which sulfur has a
dual role as anion-stabilizing
and as leaving group in the
section on sulfonium salts.

The fi rst step is conjugate addition of the highly stabilized anion. The intermediate enolate
then closes the three-membered ring by favourable nucleophilic attack on the allylic carbon.
The leaving group is the sulfi nate anion and the stereochemistry comes from the most favourable arrangement in the transition state for this ring closure. The product is the methyl ester
of the important chrysanthemic acid found in the natural pyrethrum insecticides.

Sulfi des are nucleophiles even when not deprotonated—the sulfur atom will attack alkyl halides to form sulfonium salts. This is, of course, a familiar pattern of reactivity for amines, and
you have seen phosphonium salts formed in a similar way.
This reaction is an equilibrium and it may be necessary in making sulfonium salts from less
reactive sulfi des (sterically hindered ones, for example) to use more powerful alkylating agents
with non-nucleophilic counterions, for example Me3O[+] BF4−, trimethyloxonium fl uoroborate
(also known as Meerwein’s salt). The sulfur atom captures a methyl group from O[+], but the
reverse does not happen and the BF4− anion is not a nucleophile. Not only is dimethyl ether a
poor nucleophile, it is also a gas and is lost from the reaction mixture. The same principle is
used to make sulfi des from other sulfi des.

The most important chemistry of sulfonium salts is based on one or both of two
attributes:

**1.** Sulfonium salts are electrophiles: nucleophilic substitution displaces a neutral sulfi de
leaving group.

**2.** Sulfonium salts can be deprotonated to give sulfonium ylids.

###### Sulfonium salts as electrophiles

During the First World War, mustard gas was developed as a chemical weapon—it causes the
skin to blister and is an intense irritant of the respiratory tract. Its reactivity towards human
tissue is related to the following observation and is gruesome testimony to the powerful electrophilic properties of sulfonium ions.

In both cases, intramolecular displacement of the chloride leaving group by the sulfur
atom—or, as we should call it, participation by sulfur—gives a three-membered cyclic sulfonium ion intermediate (an episulfonium or thiiranium ion). Nucleophilic attack on this electrophilic sulfonium ion, either by water or by the structural proteins of the skin, is very fast. Of
course, mustard gas can react twice in this way. You will see several more examples of reactions
in which a sulfonium ion intermediate acts as an electrophile in the next section.

###### Sulfonium ylids

The positive charge carried by the sulfur atom means that the protons next to the sulfur atom
in a sulfonium salt are signifi cantly more acidic than those in a sulfi de, and sulfonium salts
can be deprotonated to give sulfonium ylids.
In Chapter 11 we discussed the Wittig reaction of phosphonium ylids with carbonyl compounds. Sulfonium ylids react with carbonyl compounds too, but in quite a different way—
compare these two reactions.

Phosphonium ylids give alkenes while sulfonium ylids give epoxides. Why should this be
the case? The driving force in the Wittig reaction is formation of the strong P=O bond—that
force is much less in the sulfur analogues (the P=O bond strength in Ph3PO is 529 kJ mol[−][1]; in
Ph2SO the S=O bond strength is 367 kJ mol[−][1]). The fi rst step is the same in both reactions: the
carbanion of the ylid attacks the carbonyl group in a nucleophilic addition reaction. The
intermediate in the Wittig reaction cyclizes to give a four-membered ring but this does not
happen with the sulfur ylids. Instead, the intermediate decomposes by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of Me2S by the oxyanion.



- A reminder. An ylid is a
species with positive and
negative charges on adjacent
atoms.


The Wittig reaction of
phosphonium ylids was introduced
on p. 237 and appears again at the
end of this chapter, p. 689.

Sulfonium ylids are therefore useful for making epoxides from aldehydes or ketones; other

Some chemists working on a route to some potential β-blocker drugs needed the epoxide
below, and since 4-cyclopropylbenzaldehyde was more readily available than 4-cyclopropyl
styrene, they decided to use the aldehyde as the starting material and make the epoxide in one
step using a sulfonium ylid.

If there is a conjugating group on the carbanion carbon atom of the ylid, the ylid is more stable and its reactions may change. Firstly, an example where the ylid is stabilized by a cyanide.
As you have just seen, the simple sulfonium ylid gives the epoxide from this α,β-unsaturated
ketone. But the ‘stabilized’ ylid gives the cyclopropane instead.

In the absence of the conjugated alkene, both types of ylid give epoxides—the ester-stabilized ylid, for example, reacts with the diketone known as benzil to give an epoxide but with

Why does the stabilized ylid prefer to react with the double bond? The enone has two electrophilic sites, but from Chapter 22, in which we discussed the regioselectivity of attack of
nucleophiles on Michael acceptors like this, you would expect that direct 1,2-attack on the
ketone is the faster reaction. This step is irreversible, and subsequent displacement of the
sulfi de leaving group by the alkoxide produces an epoxide. Whether a cyclopropane product
would have been more stable is irrelevant to the outcome: the epoxide forms faster and is
therefore the kinetic product.

irreversible slow conjugate addition

With a stabilized ylid, direct addition to the carbonyl group is, in fact, probably still the faster
reaction. But in this case, the starting materials are suffi ciently stable that the reaction is reversible, and the sulfonium ylid is re-expelled before the epoxide has a chance to form. Meanwhile,
some ylid adds to the ketone in a 1,4 (Michael or conjugate) fashion. 1,4-Addition, although
slower, is energetically more favourable because the new C–C bond is gained at the expense of
a (relatively) weak C=C π bond rather than a (relatively) strong C=O π bond, and is therefore
irreversible. Eventually, all the ylid ends up adding in a 1,4-fashion, generating an enolate as it
does so, which cyclizes to give the cyclopropane, which is the thermodynamic product. This is
another classic example of kinetic versus thermodynamic control, and you can add it to your
mental list of examples.

###### Sulfoxonium ylids

There is another, very important, class of stabilized sulfur ylids that owe their stability not to
an additional anion-stabilizing substituent but to a more anion-stabilizing sulfur group.
These are the sulfoxonium ylids, made from dimethylsulfoxide by SN2 substitution with an
alkyl halide. Note that the sulfur atom is the nucleophile rather than the oxygen atom in spite
of the charge distribution. The high-energy sulfur lone pair is better at SN2 substitution at
saturated carbon—a reaction that depends very little on charge attraction (Chapter 15).

Sulfoxonium ylids react with unsaturated carbonyl compounds in the same way as the stabilized ylids that you have met already—they form cyclopropanes rather than epoxides. The
example below shows one consequence of this reactivity pattern—by changing from a sulfonium to a sulfoxonium ylid, high yields of either epoxide or cyclopropane can be formed from
an unsaturated carbonyl compound (this one is the terpene known as carvone).

In the fi rst step, DMSO reacts with oxalyl chloride to give an electrophilic sulfur compound.
You should not be surprised that it is the charged oxygen atom that attacks the carbonyl group
rather than the soft sulfur atom. Chloride is released in this acylation and it attacks the positively charged sulfur atom, expelling a remarkable leaving group that fragments into three
pieces: CO2, CO, and a chloride ion. Entropy favours this reaction.

an ylid. The fi nal step completes the redox reaction: the transfer of a proton to the anionic
carbon gives an aldehyde, with overall reduction of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to dimethylsulfi de (DMS).

###### Silicon and carbon compared

Silicon is immediately below carbon in the periodic table and the most obvious similarity is
that both elements normally have a valency of four and both form tetrahedral compounds.
There are important differences in the chemistry of carbon and silicon—silicon is less important and many books are devoted solely to carbon chemistry but relatively few to silicon
chemistry. Carbon forms many stable trigonal and linear compounds containing π bonds;
silicon forms few. The most important difference is the strength of the silicon–oxygen σ bond
(368 kJ mol[−][1]) and the relative weakness of the silicon–silicon (230 kJ mol[−][1]) bond. Together
these values account for the absence, in the oxygen-rich atmosphere of earth, of silicon analogues of the plethora of structures possible with a carbon skeleton.

Several of the values in the table give insight into the reactivity differences between carbon
and silicon. Bonds to electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with
carbon; in particular, the silicon–fl uorine bond is one of the strongest single bonds known,
while bonds to electropositive elements are weaker. Silicon–hydrogen bonds are much weaker
than their carbon counterparts and can be cleaved easily. Here are a few organosilicon
compounds.

In this section we will mostly discuss compounds with four Si–C bonds. Three of these
bonds will usually be the same so we will often have a Me3Si group attached to an organic
molecule. We shall discuss reactions in which something interesting happens to the organic
molecule as one of the Si–C bonds reacts to give a new Si–F or Si–O bond. We shall also
discuss organosilicon compounds as reagents, such as triethylsilane (Et3SiH), which is a reducing agent whereas Et3C–H is not.


-----

The carbon–silicon bond is strong enough for the trialkyl silyl group to survive synthetic
transformations on the rest of the molecule but weak enough for it to be cleaved specifi cally
when we want. In particular, fl uoride ion is a poor nucleophile for carbon compounds but
attacks silicon very readily. Another important factor is the length of the C–Si bond (1.89
Å)—it is signifi cantly longer than a typical C–C bond (1.54 Å). Silicon has a lower electronegativity (1.8) than carbon (2.5) and therefore C–Si bonds are polarized towards the carbon.
This makes the silicon susceptible to attack by nucleophiles. The strength of the C–Si bond
means that alkyl silanes are stable but the most useful chemistry arises from carbon substituents other than simple alkyl groups.

###### Silicon has an affi nity for electronegative atoms

The most effective nucleophiles for silicon are the electronegative ones that will form strong
bonds to silicon. Those based on oxygen or halide ions (chloride and fl uoride) are pre-eminent.
You saw this in the choice of reagent for the selective cleavage of silyl ethers in Chapter 23.
Tetrabutylammonium fl uoride is often used as this is an organic-soluble ionic fl uoride and
forms a silyl fl uoride as the by-product. The mechanism is not a simple SN2 process and has no
direct analogue in carbon chemistry. It looks like a substitution at a hindered tertiary centre,
which ought to be virtually impossible. Two characteristics of silicon facilitate the process: the
long silicon–carbon bonds relieve the steric interactions and the d orbitals of silicon provide a
target for the nucleophile that does not have the same geometric constraints as a C–O σ* orbital.

Attack of the fl uoride on the empty d orbital leads to a negatively charged pentacoordinate
intermediate that breaks down with loss of the alkoxide. The discrete pentacoordinate trigonal
bipyramid intermediate contrasts with the similarly shaped pentacoordinate transition state of
a carbon-based SN2 reaction. It is often omitted in mechanistic schemes because it is formed
slowly and decomposes quickly, and the mechanism is still referred to as ‘SN2 at silicon’.

###### Nucleophilic substitution at silicon

You may wonder why trimethylsilyl chloride does not use the SN1 mechanism familiar from
the analogous carbon compound t-butyl chloride. There is, in fact, nothing wrong with the
Me3Si[+] cation—it can be detected in mass spectra, for example. The reason is simply that the
‘SN2’ reaction at silicon is too good for SN1 to compete.

There are some important differences between the SN2 substitutions at Si and at C. Alkyl
halides are soft electrophiles but silyl halides are hard electrophiles. Alkyl halides react only
very slowly with fl uoride ion but silyl halides react more rapidly with fl uoride than with any
other nucleophile. The best nucleophiles for saturated carbon are neutral or based on elements
down the periodic table (S, Se, I) or both. The best nucleophiles for silicon are charged and
based on highly electronegative atoms (chiefl y F, Cl, and O). A familiar example is the reaction
of enolates at carbon with alkyl halides but at oxygen with silyl chlorides (Chapter 20).

The other side of the coin is that the SN2 reaction at carbon is not much affected by partial
positive charge (δ+) on the carbon atom. The ‘SN2’ reaction at silicon is affected by the charge
on silicon. The most electrophilic silicon compounds are the silyl trifl ates and it is estimated
that they react some 10[8]–10[9] times faster with oxygen nucleophiles than do silyl chlorides.
Trimethylsilyl trifl ate is, in fact, an excellent Lewis acid and can be used to form acetals or silyl
enol ethers from carbonyl compounds, and to react these two together in aldol-style reactions.
In all three reactions the trifl ate attacks an oxygen atom. In the acetal formation, silylation
occurs twice at the carbonyl oxygen atom and the fi nal leaving group is hexamethyldisiloxane.
You should compare this with the normal acid-catalysed mechanism described in Chapter 11,
where the carbonyl group is twice protonated and the leaving group is water.

###### The Peterson elimination

There are many reactions in organic chemistry in which an Me3Si group acts like a proton. Just
as acidic protons are removed by bases, silicon is readily removed by hard nucleophiles, particularly F[−] or RO[−], and this can promote an elimination. An example is shown here.

**HO** **H2O**

This reaction is known as the Peterson elimination. It is rather like those we discussed in
Chapter 17—eliminations of alcohols under acidic conditions to give alkenes. But, unlike those
reactions, it is fully regioselective and so is particularly useful for making double bonds where
other elimination methods might give the wrong regioisomer or mixtures of regioisomers. In
this next example only one product is formed, in high yield, and it has an exocyclic double
bond. Just think what would have happened without the silicon atom (ignore the one attached
to the oxygen—that’s just a protecting group). This compound is, in fact, an intermediate in a
synthetic route to the important anticancer compound Taxol.

The Peterson reaction is particularly useful for making terminal or exocyclic double bonds
connectively because the starting material (the magnesium derivative shown above) is easily
made from available Me3SiCH2Br.

###### Alkynyl silanes are used for protection and activation

Terminal alkynes have an acidic proton (pKa ca. 25) that can be removed by very strong bases
such as organometallic reagents (Grignards, RLi, etc.). While this is often what is intended, in
other circumstances it may be an unwanted side reaction that would consume an organometallic reagent or interfere with the chosen reaction. Exchange of the terminal proton of an
alkyne for a trimethylsilyl group exploits the relative acidity of the proton and provides a neat
solution to these problems. The SiMe3 group protects the terminus of the alkyne during the
reaction but can then be removed with fl uoride or sodium hydroxide. A classic case is the
removal of a proton next door to a terminal alkyne.

Additionally, acetylene itself is a useful two-carbon building block but is not very convenient to handle as it is an explosive gas. Trimethylsilylacetylene is a distillable liquid that is a
convenient substitute for acetylene in reactions involving the lithium derivative as it has
only one acidic proton. The synthesis of this alkynyl ketone is an example. Deprotonation
with butyl lithium provides the alkynyl lithium that reacted with the alkyl chloride in the
presence of iodide as nucleophilic catalyst (see Chapter 15). Removal of the trimethylsilyl

###### Silicon stabilizes a positive charge on the β carbon

In common with ordinary alkynes, silylated alkynes are nucleophilic towards electrophiles.
The presence of the silicon has a dramatic effect on the regioselectivity of this reaction: attack
occurs only at the atom directly bonded to the silicon. This must be because the intermediate
cation is stabilized.

The familiar hierarchy of carbocation stability—tertiary > secondary > primary—is due to
the stabilization of the positive charge by donation of electron density from adjacent C–H or
C–C bonds (their fi lled σ orbitals to be precise) that are aligned correctly with the vacant
orbital. The electropositive nature of silicon makes C–Si bonds even more effective donors: a
silyl group β to a positive charge (i.e. attached to the next-door carbon) stabilizes a positive
charge so effectively that the course of a reaction involving cationic intermediates is often
completely controlled. This is stabilization by σ donation.

The stabilization of the cation also weakens the C–Si bond by delocalization so that the
bond is more easily broken. Attack of a nucleophile (particularly a halogen or oxygen nucleophile) on silicon removes it from the organic fragment and the net result is electrophilic
substitution in which the silicon has been replaced by the electrophile.
This is useful for the synthesis of alkynyl ketones, which are diffi cult to make directly with
conventional organometallic reagents such as alkynyl–Li or –MgBr because they add a second
time to the ketone product. Alkynyl silanes react in a Friedel–Crafts manner with acid chlorides in the presence of Lewis acids, such as aluminium chloride, to give the ketones.

###### Aryl silanes undergo ipso substitution with electrophiles

Exactly the same sort of mechanism accounts for the reactions of aryl silanes with electrophiles under Friedel–Crafts conditions. Instead of the usual rules governing ortho, meta, and
_para substitution using the directing effects of the substituents, there is just one rule: the silyl_
group is replaced by the electrophile at the same atom on the ring—this is known as ipso


-----

substitution. Actually, this selectivity comes from the same principles as those used for ordinary aromatic substitution (Chapter 21): the electrophile reacts to produce the most stable
cation—in this case β to silicon. Cleavage of the weakened C–Si bond by any nucleophile
leads directly to the ipso product.

There is an alternative site of attack meta to silicon that would lead to a cation β to Si. But
this cation is not particularly stable because the vacant p orbital is orthogonal to the C–Si
bond and so cannot interact with it as the C–Si bond is still in the plane of the ring. This
illustrates that it is more important to understand the origin of the effect based on molecular
orbitals rather than simply to remember the result.

This reactivity of aryl silanes is used to convert stable phenyldimethylsilyl compounds into
more reactive compounds such as alcohols by a reaction such as that shown in the margin.
Several reagents can be used, all of which induce ipso substitution of the phenyl silane. The
reaction with bromine is typical. Bromobenzene is produced together with a silyl bromide
that is activated towards subsequent oxidation.
The mechanism of electrophilic desilylation is the same as that for electrophilic aromatic
substitution except that the proton is replaced by the trimethylsilyl group. The silicon stabilizes the intermediate cation, and hence the transition state leading to it, to such an extent
that the rate is many orders of magnitude faster. This is the fi rst step with bromine.

###### Vinyl silanes offer a regio- and stereoselective route to alkenes

Vinyl silanes react with electrophiles in a similarly regioselective process in which the silicon
is replaced by the electrophile at the ipso carbon atom. The stereochemistry of the vinyl silane
is important because this exchange usually occurs with retention of geometry as well.

This is a curious and interesting reaction that deserves explanation. Addition of the electrophile next to silicon leads to the more stable cation β to silicon. In the vinyl silane the C–Si bond
is orthogonal to the p orbitals of the π bond, but as the electrophile attacks the π bond, say from
underneath, the Me3Si group starts to move upwards. As it rotates, the angle between the C–Si
bond and the remaining p orbital decreases from 90°. As the angle decreases, the interaction
between the C–Si bond and the empty p orbital of the cation increases. There is every reason for
the rotation to continue in the same direction and no reason for it to reverse. The diagram
shows that, in the resulting cation, the electrophile is in the position formerly occupied by the
Me3Si group, trans to Ph. Loss of the group now gives retention of stereochemistry.

The intermediate cation has only a single bond and so rotation might be expected to lead to
a mixture of geometrical isomers of the product but this is not observed. The bonding interaction between the C–Si bond and the empty p orbital means that rotation is restricted. This
stabilization weakens the C–Si bond and the silyl group is quickly removed before any further
rotation can occur. The stabilization is effective only if the C–Si bond is correctly aligned
with the vacant orbital, which means it must be in the same plane—rather like a π bond. Here
is the result for both E and Z isomers of the vinyl silane.

halides are important starting
materials for transition-metalcatalysed alkene synthesis
(Chapter 40).


It is unusual for silicon to be required in the fi nal product of a synthetic sequence and the
stereospecifi c removal of silicon from vinyl silanes makes them useful reagents that can be
regarded as rather stable vinylic organometallic reagents that will react with powerful electrophiles, preserving the double bond location and geometry. Protodesilylation, as the process of
replacing silicon with a proton is known, is one such important reaction. The halogens are
also useful electrophiles while organic halides, particularly acid chlorides, in the presence of
Lewis acids, form vinyl halides and unsaturated ketones of defi ned geometry.

###### Allyl silanes as nucleophiles

If the silyl group is moved along the carbon chain by just one atom, an allyl silane results.
Allyl silanes can be produced from allyl organometallic reagents but there is often a problem
over which regioisomer is produced and mixtures often result. Better methods control the
position of the double bond. Two useful examples take advantage of the Wittig reaction and
the Peterson elimination to construct the alkene linkage. The reagents are prepared from trimethylsilyl halides either by formation of the corresponding Grignard reagent or alkylation
with a primary Wittig reagent and deprotonation to form a new ylid. The Grignard reagent,
with added cerium trichloride, adds twice to esters to give the corresponding tertiary alcohol,
which loses one of its Me3Si groups in a Peterson elimination to reveal the remaining Me3Si
group as part of allyl silane.

The Wittig reagent is made by alkylation of the simplest ylid with the same silicon reagent.
Notice that the leaving group (iodide) is on the carbon next to silicon, not on the silicon itself.
Anion formation occurs next to phosphorus because Ph3P[+] is much more anion-stabilizing
than Me3Si. The ylid reacts with carbonyl compounds such as cyclohexanone in the usual way
to produce the allyl silane with no ambiguity over which end of the allyl system is silylated.

The carbon–silicon bond has two important effects on the adjacent alkene. The presence of
a high-energy fi lled σ orbital of the correct symmetry to interact with the π system produces
an alkene that is more reactive with electrophiles, due to the higher-energy HOMO, and the
same σ orbital stabilizes the carbocation if attack occurs at the remote end of the alkene. This
lowers the transition state for electrophilic addition and makes allyl silanes much more reactive than isolated alkenes.

###### Allyl silanes are more reactive than vinyl silanes but also react through β-silyl cations

Vinyl silanes have C–Si bonds orthogonal to the p orbitals of the alkene—the C–Si bond is in
the nodal plane of the π bond—so there can be no interaction between the C–Si bond and the
π bond. Allyl silanes, by contrast, have C–Si bonds that can be, and normally are, parallel to
the p orbitals of the π bond so that interaction is possible.

Allyl silanes react with electrophiles with even greater regioselectivity than that of vinyl
silanes. The cation β to the silyl group is again formed but there are two important differences.
Most obviously, the electrophile attacks at the other end of the allylic system and there is no
rotation necessary as the C–Si bond is already in a position to overlap effi ciently with the
intermediate cation. The process is terminated by loss of silicon in the usual way to regenerate
an alkene.

Molecular orbitals demonstrate the smooth transition from the allyl silane, which has a π
bond and a C–Si σ bond, to the allylic product with a new π bond and a new σ bond to the
electrophile. The intermediate cation is mainly stabilized by σ donation from the C–Si bond
into the vacant p orbital but it has other σ-donating groups (C–H, C–C, and C–E) that also
help. The overall process is electrophilic substitution with allylic rearrangement. Both the site
of attachment of the electrophile and the position of the new double bond are dictated by the
silicon.

Allyl silanes are rather like silyl enol ethers: they react with electrophiles, provided they
are activated, for example by a Lewis acid. Titanium tetrachloride is widely used but other
successful Lewis acids include boron trifl uoride, aluminium chloride, and trimethylsilyl
trifl ate. Electrophiles include acylium ions produced from acid chlorides, carbocations from
tertiary halides or secondary benzylic halides, activated enones, and epoxides all in the
presence of Lewis acid. In each case the new bond is highlighted in black.

- Homoallylic means allylic
plus one carbon.


###### Lewis acids promote couplings via oxonium ions

Allyl silanes will also attack carbonyl compounds when they are activated by coordination of
the carbonyl oxygen atom to a Lewis acid. The Lewis acid, usually a metal halide such as TiCl4
or ZnCl2, activates the carbonyl compound by forming an oxonium ion with a metal–oxygen
bond. The allyl silane attacks in the usual way and the β-silyl cation is desilylated with the
halide ion. Hydrolysis of the metal alkoxide gives a homoallylic alcohol.

A closely related reactive oxonium ion can be prepared by Lewis acid catalysed breakdown
of the corresponding acetal. Alternatively, especially if the acetal is at least partly a silyl acetal,
the same oxonium ion can be produced in situ using yet more silicon in the form of TMSOTf
as the Lewis acid catalyst. All these intermediate oxonium ions act as powerful electrophiles
towards allyl silanes, producing homoallylic alcohols or ethers.

###### The selective synthesis of alkenes

S, Si, P, and other main group elements have several important functions in organic chemistry,
and one in which all of S, Si, and P each play a star role is in the synthesis of alkenes. You have
met alkenes participating in reactions in a number of chapters, but our discussion of how to
_make alkenes has so far been quite limited. Chapter 17 was about elimination reactions, and_
there you met E1 and E2 reactions. You had a glimpse of the importance of phosphorus in
alkene synthesis in Chapter 11, where you met the Wittig reaction, and earlier in this chapter
you saw silicon participating in the Peterson elimination. We’re now going to look at related
reactions in more detail, addressing especially how to form alkenes with control over their
_geometry. First we need to establish that this is an important task and remind you of some reac-_
tions you have already met that can be used for it.

###### The properties of alkenes depend on their geometry

Geometrical isomers of alkenes are different compounds with different physical, chemical, and biological properties. They are often hard to separate by chromatography or
distillation, so it is important that chemists have methods for making them as single
isomers.

###### Elimination reactions and stereoselectivity

Unfortunately, most elimination reactions (Chapter 17) offer little control over the geometry
of the product: treating sec-butanol in acid, for example, gives mainly the more substituted
2-butene, but as a 3:1 mixture of geometrical isomers. But there are some important exceptions. If the product has the double bond inside a ring of less than eight members, it has to be
a cis double bond. Examples include the simple dehydration of a cyclopentanol and an intramolecular aldol reaction. The six-membered ring is formed before the dehydration step.

- Some people call geometrical
isomers diastereoisomers, which
they are in a sense: they are
stereoisomers that are not
mirror images. However, we
shall avoid this usage since for
most chemists the word
diastereoisomer carries
implications of threedimensional stereochemistry.


But how can we use elimination reactions to give single geometrical isomers of open-chain
compounds? These reactions fall into four main classes, and we shall look at each in turn
before summarizing the most important methods at the end of the chapter.



- **Ways of making single geometrical isomers of double bonds**

**1. Using the fact that only one geometrical isomer is possible (for example, a cis double bond**
**in a six-membered ring).**

**2. The geometrical isomers are in equilibrium and the more stable (usually E ) is formed.**

**3. The reaction is stereoselective and the E alkene or the Z alkene is formed as the main**
**product by kinetic control.**

**4. The reaction is stereospecifi c and the alkene geometry depends on the stereochemistry of**
**the starting materials and the mechanism of the reaction.**


###### Exploiting cyclic compounds

You may think that this method is rather too trivial to be called a method for controlling the
geometry of double bonds, as it’s only of any use for making cyclic alkenes. Well, chemists are
more ingenious than that! It is not necessary to have an all-carbon ring to preserve the cis
geometry of a double bond. Lactones (cyclic esters) and cyclic anhydrides are useful too.


-----

A double bond in a fi ve- or six-membered compound must have a cis confi guration and compounds like these are readily made. Dehydration of this hydroxylactone can give only a cis
double bond and ring-opening with a nucleophile (alcohol, hydroxide, amine) gives an openchain compound also with a cis double bond.

E J Corey used a similar idea to make the insect hormone we introduced on p. 678). He realized that the essential Z double bond would be easy to make if he were to start with a cyclic

Birch reduction (Chapter 23, p. 542) of a simple aromatic ether generated two cis double
bonds. The more reactive (because it is more electron-rich) of these reacts with ozone to give
an aldehyde-ester in which the Z geometry is preserved. NaBH4 reduces the aldehyde group to
a hydroxyl group, which needs to be got rid of: a good way to do this is to tosylate and reduce
with LiAlH4, which substitutes H for OTs. The LiAlH4 also does the job of reducing the ester to
an alcohol, giving the Z-confi gured compound that Corey needed.

###### Equilibration of alkenes

Acyclic E alkenes are usually more stable than acyclic Z alkenes because they are less sterically hindered. Yet Z alkenes do not spontaneously convert to E alkenes because the π bond
prevents free rotation: the energy required to break the π bond is about 260 kJ mol[−][1] (rotation about a σ bond requires about 10 kJ mol[−][1]). You may therefore fi nd the following result
surprising. Dimethyl maleate is easily made by refl uxing maleic anhydride in methanol
with an acid catalyst. If the product is isolated straight away, a liquid boiling at 199–202°C
is obtained. This is dimethyl maleate. However, if the product is left to stand, crystals of
_dimethyl fumarate (the_ _E isomer of dimethyl maleate) form. How has the geometry been_
inverted so easily?

A clue is that the process is accelerated enormously by a trace of amine. Michael addition of
this amine, or of methanol, or any other nucleophile, provides a chemical mechanism by
which the π bond can be broken. There is free rotation in the intermediate, and re-elimination
of the nucleophile can give either E or Z alkene. The greater stability and crystallinity of the
_E alkene means that it dominates the equilibrium. Michael addition therefore provides a_
mechanism for the equilibration of Z alkenes to E alkenes.

another simple example of the
type we have just been
discussing: the Z alkene arises
from the cyclic starting material.

Some Japanese chemists needed the E,E diene below for a synthesis of a neurotoxic compound that they had isolated from poison dart frogs. Unfortunately, their synthesis (which
used a Wittig reaction—described in detail later in this chapter) gave only 4:1 E selectivity at
one of the double bonds. To produce pure E,E diene, they equilibrated the E,Z diene to E,E by
treating with iodine and irradiating with a sun-lamp.



- The addition–elimination of
iodine can follow either an ionic
or a radical pathway. As
explained in Chapter 24
(p. 572), the radical pathway is
encouraged by irradiation with
light. In this reaction, light
energy is absorbed by iodine to
make I[•] radicals; in the next
section it is the alkene itself
which absorbs the light.


###### Using light to make Z alkenes from E alkenes

Light allows the interconversion of the two isomers of an alkene by promoting a π electron
into the π* orbital and transiently breaking the π bond, but the way light favours formation of
the Z isomer is rather subtle. One difference between cis and trans alkenes is that the trans
alkenes usually absorb light better than the cis alkenes—they absorb light of a higher wavelength and they absorb more of it, particularly when conjugated with carbonyl groups. Steric
hindrance forces the cis alkene to twist about the σ bond joining the alkene to the carbonyl
group and conjugation is then less effi cient. In a mixture of E and Z alkenes, the E alkene is
more prone to isomerization by light, so the Z isomer builds up in the mixture.
Here is an example. Aldol condensation of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde gives pure E
alkene for the reasons explained above. Irradiation with longer-wavelength UV light equilibrates this to the Z alkene in excellent yield.

It is not possible for the benzene ring and the enone system to be planar in the Z-enone and
so they twist, making conjugation not as good as in the E-enone. Longer-wavelength light is
absorbed only by the E-enone, which is continually equilibrated back to the excited state.
Eventually, all the E-enone is converted to the Z-enone, which is not as effi ciently excited by
the light. The fi nal mixture of E- and Z-enone is known as a ‘photostationary state’.

###### E and Z alkenes can be made by stereoselective addition to alkynes

Alkenes can be made from alkynes by reduction or addition, and under the right conditions
either the Z double bond or the E double bond can be formed stereoselectively.

###### Z-selective reduction of alkynes using Lindlar’s catalyst

The Z alkene below was needed pure for studies on the mechanism of a rearrangement reaction. In Chapter 23 you met catalytic hydrogenation as a means of reducing alkenes to alkanes,



- The excited state, in which
an electron from the π orbital
has been promoted to the π*
orbital, can be represented as a
‘diradical’—the π bond is
effectively broken, with the two
electrons which formed it now
residing, unpaired, on the two C
atoms.

- The reason that catalytic
hydrogenation often results in
syn addition of hydrogen to
alkenes was discussed in
Chapter 23.


and we introduced Lindlar’s catalyst (palladium and lead acetate on a support of calcium
carbonate) as a means of controlling chemoselectivity so that _alkynes could be reduced to_
_alkenes. What we did not emphasize then was that the two hydrogen atoms add to the alkyne_
in a syn fashion and the alkene produced is a Z alkene. The stereoselectivity arises because two
hydrogen atoms, bound to the catalyst, are delivered simultaneously to the alkyne.

The sodium donates an electron to the LUMO of the triple bond (one of the two orthogonal
π* orbitals). The resulting radical anion can pick up a proton from the ammonia solution to
give a vinyl radical. A second electron, supplied again by the sodium, gives an anion that can
adopt the more stable trans geometry. A fi nal proton quench by a second molecule of ammonia or by an added proton source (t-butanol is often used, as in the Birch reduction) forms the
_E alkene._

An alternative, and more widely used, method is to reduce alkynes with LiAlH4 or the
related reducing agent known as RedAl. This reaction works only if there is a hydroxy or an

Earlier in this chapter you were introduced to the signifi cance of geometrically pure vinyl
silanes, which can act as precursors to other alkenes. Controlled reduction of alkynyl silanes
gives the corresponding vinyl silanes, with the method of reduction dictating the stereochemistry. Lindlar hydrogenation adds a molecule of hydrogen across the alkyne in a _cis_
fashion to produce the Z-vinyl silane. RedAl reduction of a propargylic alcohol leads instead
to the E isomer.

The mechanism of the aluminium hydride reductions with LiAlH4 or RedAl involve a trans
hydroalumination helped by coordination of Al to the triple bond and external nucleophilic
attack. The regioselectivity of the hydroalumination is again determined by silicon: the electrophilic Al attacks the alkyne on the carbon bearing the silyl group (the ipso carbon).

###### Addition of nucleophiles to alkynes

This rarer, and rather surprising, approach to Z alkenes can give excellent results, particularly
in the addition of nucleophiles to butadiyne. The base-catalysed addition of methanol gives an
excellent yield of Z-1-methoxybut-1-en-3-yne. This reaction is so easy to do that the product is
available commercially. Notice that methanol adds once only: you would not expect nucleophiles to add to a simple alkyne and it is the conjugation that makes addition possible.

**MeOH**

**MeO**
base

Methoxide ion adds to one of the alkynes to give a conjugated anion. The anion is linear
with the negative charge delocalized into the second alkyne. The charge is therefore in a p
orbital in the plane of the molecule, with a second conjugated π system oriented at right
angles to the plane of the molecule.



- We showed you in
Chapter 19 (p. 435) how
molecular orbitals explain why
dienes are both more
nucleophilic and more
electrophilic than simple
alkenes. The same arguments
apply to diynes.

If you are unclear on the
difference between stereoselective
and stereospecifi c reactions, or
between kinetic and
thermodynamic control, go back
and re-read Chapters 12 and 17—
these concepts are very important
for this chapter. The antiperiplanar transition state
preferred by E2 reactions is
described on p. 395.


###### Predominantly E alkenes can be formed by stereoselective elimination reactions

In Chapter 17 you saw that E1 elimination reactions usually give mainly E alkenes (there’s an
example earlier in this chapter) because the transition state leading to an E double bond is
lower in energy than that leading to a Z double bond. In other words, E1 reactions are stereo**selective, and their stereoselectivity is** **kinetically controlled. E2 reactions are similar if**
there is a choice of protons that can be removed: the E alkene is preferred, but a mixture is still
formed. Again, this is kinetic control.

Both stereo- and regioselectivity are usually better in E1cB reactions, such as the opening of

formed as the ring opens, prefers the E geometry. The transition state for the elimination step
already looks like the product and prefers the E geometry for simple steric reasons.

Sulfoxides can be used to make alkenes stereoselectively because sulfoxides next to electronwithdrawing or conjugating groups are unstable on heating, decomposing by an elimination
process. The rather unstable phenylsulfenic acid (PhSOH) is eliminated and the reaction
occurs partly because of the creation of conjugation and partly because PhSOH decomposes
to volatile products. The starting material was made from cycloheptanone by sulfenylation of
its enolate followed by oxidation.

The elimination follows a type of mechanism we call a pericyclic reaction. Once you have
read Chapter 34 you should be able to identify the reaction as a reverse cycloaddition, but for
now you can just think of it as an elimination in which the proton is removed by the leaving
group. The alkene product in this case is in a seven-membered ring—it has to be cis.

is used to trap these destructive pests. The sulfur is introduced by reacting the enolate of the

and the sulfi de is oxidized to the sulfoxide with sodium periodate (NaIO4) ready for elimination. Heating to 110°C then gives the Queen Bee Substance in 86% yield.

###### The Julia olefi nation is regiospecifi c and connective

Sulfoxide eliminations are a valuable way of introducing a double bond to an already intact
carbon skeleton. The alkene synthesis we are about to show you is also based on sulfur chemistry, but is connective—the alkene is formed by joining together two separate fragments. It is
called the Julia olefi nation and is probably the most important application of the sulfonestabilized anions you saw earlier in the chapter. Only the alkene shown is formed, with the
double bond joining the two carbons that carried the PhSO2 and PhCO2 groups. This elimination is promoted by a reducing agent, traditionally sodium amalgam (a solution of sodium
metal in mercury) and works for a variety of compounds providing they have a phenyl sulfonyl
group adjacent to a leaving group.

The reason for the E selectivity lies in the mechanism of the elimination. The details are not

elimination of the acetate or benzoate ester to give a vinyl sulfone.

The stereochemistry of the vinyl sulfone does not matter because it is immediately reduced
by an electron from sodium to give a vinyl radical. Much as you saw above, in the Birch reduction of alkynes, the vinyl radical collects a second electron and becomes a vinyl anion, which
chooses to adopt the more stable E confi guration before being protonated to give the predominantly E alkene.

We know that there must be an anion intermediate because the elimination is not stereo_specifi c—in other words, whichever diastereoisomer of the starting material you use (all of the_
examples in this section have been mixtures of diastereoisomers) you always get the E alkene
product.

###### The one-step Julia olefi nation

The Julia reaction is remarkably versatile but it does need three steps to make the alkene: addition, acylation, and reduction. A more recent version of the reaction cuts this down to one by
using not a phenylsulfone but instead a sulfone carrying an electron-defi cient heterocycle, for
example a tetrazole. The anion of the sulfone is made with a strong base (here potassium
hexamethyldisilazide, KHMDS—see p. 635) and is added to an aldehyde to give an alkene
directly.

You met a stereospecifi c elimination in Chapter 17. The requirement for the H and the Br to
be anti-periplanar in the E2 transition state meant that the two diastereoisomers of this alkyl
bromide eliminated to alkenes with different double bond geometries (p. 396).

However, reactions like this are of limited use—their success relies on the base’s lack of
choice of protons to attack. Logic dictates that only trisubstituted double bonds can be made
stereospecifi cally in this way: the reaction must not have a choice of hydrogen atoms or an E
alkene will result stereoselectively (as in the example on p. 684). The answer is, of course, to
move away from eliminations involving H, and we can do this by returning to the Peterson
elimination, which you met on p. 671.

###### The Peterson reaction is stereospecifi c

The stereospecifi city of this elimination involving silicon arises because it is an E2 elimination proceeding via an anti-periplanar transition state. In principle, it can therefore be used
to make single geometrical isomers of alkenes, the geometry depending on the relative stereochemistry of the starting material. However, this use of the Peterson reaction is limited by
diffi culties in making diastereoisomerically pure starting materials.

There is another, complementary, version of the Peterson reaction that uses base to promote
the elimination. The starting materials are the same as for the acid-promoted Peterson reaction. When base (such as sodium hydride or potassium hydride) is added, the hydroxyl group
is deprotonated and the oxyanion attacks the silicon atom intramolecularly. Elimination takes

place this time via a syn-periplanar transition state—it has to because the oxygen and the silicon are now bonded together, and it is the strength of this bond that drives the elimination
forward.

The two versions of the Peterson reaction give opposite geometrical isomers from the same
diastereoisomer of the starting material, so from any single diastereoisomer of hydroxy silane
we can make either geometrical isomer of alkene product by choosing whether to use acid or
base. The problem is still making those single diastereoisomers!
In Chapter 17 you saw that anti-periplanar transition states are usually preferred for elimination reactions because this alignment provides the best opportunity for good overlap
between the orbitals involved. Syn-periplanar transition states can, however, also lead to
elimination—and the base-promoted Peterson reaction should remind you of the Wittig reaction, which you fi rst met in Chapter 11, with its four-membered cyclic intermediate. It is with
the Wittig reaction, and a detailed discussion of its stereoselectivity, that we now fi nish this
chapter.

###### Perhaps the most important way of making alkenes—the Wittig reaction

The Wittig reaction is another member of the class we have been talking about—it’s an elimination that does not involve loss of H. You met it in Chapter 11, where we gave a brief outline
of its mechanism.


This Wittig reaction appeared
on p. 237. We also used the Wittig
reaction to help us control enolates
on p. 627 of Chapter 26.

Conceptually, the Wittig reaction is like the base-promoted Peterson reaction: it is a _syn_
elimination, driven by the strength of an oxygen–heteroatom bond, although in this case the
heteroatom is phosphorus. But the elimination step of the Wittig reaction occurs only from
an intermediate and not from isolated starting materials. This intermediate is made in situ in
the reaction and decomposes spontaneously: the Wittig reaction is therefore another connective alkene-forming reaction, but its simplicity makes it more widely used than the Julia or
Peterson reactions.
To understand the details of the reaction, we must start at the beginning. Phosphorus
atoms, especially those that are positively charged or that carry electronegative substituents,
can increase the acidity of protons adjacent to them on the carbon skeleton. Phosphonium
salts (made in a manner analogous to the formation of ammonium salts from amines, in other
words by reaction of an alkyl halide with a phosphine) can therefore be deprotonated by a
moderately strong base to give a species known as an ylid (sometimes spelled ylide), carrying
(formally) a positive and a negative charge on adjacent atoms. Ylids can alternatively be represented as doubly bonded species, called phosphoranes.



- Phosphorus is like sulfur in
this regard: you can compare
the phosphonium ylid with the
sulfonyl-stabilized anions you
met earlier.

- In Chapter 11, to help you
understand the reaction, we
showed the addition to the
carbonyl group to make the
four-membered ring taking place
in two steps. These steps are
probably in fact concerted (they
both happen at the same time),
and a better representation of
the reaction is the single-step
formation of the four-membered
ring shown here.


Ylids can be isolated, but are usually used in reactions immediately they are formed. They
are nucleophilic species that will attack the carbonyl groups of aldehydes or ketones, generating the four-membered ring oxaphosphetane intermediates. Oxaphosphetanes are unstable:
they undergo elimination to give an alkene (65% yield for this particular example) with a
phosphine oxide as a by-product. The phosphorus–oxygen double bond is extremely strong
and it is this that drives the whole reaction forward.


###### Stereoselectivity in the Wittig reaction depends on the ylid

The Wittig reactions below were all used in the synthesis of natural products. You will notice
that some reactions are Z selective and some are E selective. Look closer, and you see that the
stereoselectivity is dependent on the nature of the substituent on the carbon atom of the ylid.

We can divide ylids into two types: those with conjugating or anion-stabilizing substituents
adjacent to the negative charge (such as carbonyl groups) and those without. We call the fi rst
sort stabilized ylids because the negative charge is stabilized not only by the phosphorus
atom but by the adjacent functional group—we can draw an alternative enolate-type structure to represent this extra stabilization. The rest we call unstabilized ylids.



- **The stereochemistry of the Wittig reaction**

**The general rule is:**

**•** **with stabilized ylids the Wittig reaction is E selective**

**•** **with unstabilized ylids the Wittig reaction is Z selective.**


###### The Z-selective Wittig reaction

The _Z selectivity observed with simple alkyl R groups is nicely complementary to the_ _E_
select ivity observed in the Julia olefi nation. This complementarity was exploited by some
chemists who wanted to make isomers of capsaicin (the compound that gives chilli peppers


-----

their ‘hotness’) to follow up suggestions that capsaicin might be carcinogenic. The key intermediates in the synthesis of the E and Z isomers of capsaicin were the E and Z unsaturated
esters shown below. By using a Wittig reaction with an unstabilized ylid it was possible to
make the Z isomer selectively, whilst the Julia olefi nation gave the E isomer.

How can the Z selectivity in Wittig reactions of unstabilized ylids be explained? We have a
more complex situation in this reaction than we had for the other eliminations we considered
because we have two separate processes to consider: formation of the oxaphosphetane and
decomposition of the oxaphosphetane to the alkene. The elimination step is the easier one to
explain—it is stereospecifi c, with the oxygen and phosphorus departing in a syn-periplanar
transition state. Addition of the ylid to the aldehyde can, in principle, produce two diastereoisomers of the intermediate oxaphosphetane. Provided that this step is irreversible, then the
stereospecifi city of the elimination step means that the ratio of the fi nal alkene geometrical
isomers will refl ect the stereoselectivity of this addition step.
When R is not conjugating or anion-stabilizing, the syn diastereoisomer of the oxaphosphetane is formed preferentially, and the predominantly Z alkene that results refl ects this.
The Z-selective Wittig reaction therefore consists of a stereoselective fi rst step, to form the syn
oxaphosphetane, followed by a stereospecifi c elimination from this intermediate to give a Z
alkene.

Why the _syn oxaphosphetane is favoured with unstabilized ylids is the subject of much_
debate because the mechanism by which the oxaphosphetane is formed is not entirely understood. One possible explanation relies on rules of orbital symmetry, which you will meet in
Chapters 34 and 35—we need not explain them in detail here but there is good reason to
believe that, if the ylid and carbonyl compound react together to give the oxaphosphetane in
one step, they will do so by approaching one another at right angles. Here we have drawn the
ylid in its phosphorane form, adding to benzaldehyde. Keeping the large substituents apart
produces a transition state like that shown below, which (correctly) predicts that the oxaphosphetane will have syn stereochemistry.

These stabilized ylids really are stable—this one, for example, can be recrystallized from
water and the ylid is more stable than the phosphonium salt from which it might be made.
This stability means though that they are not very reactive, and often it is better not to use the
phosphonium salt but a phosphonate instead.

Phosphonate esters can be deprotonated with sodium hydride or alkoxide anions to give
enolate-type anions that react well with aldehydes or ketones to give _E alkenes. Alkene-_
forming reactions with phosphonates are called Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons (or Horner–
Emmons, Wadsworth– Emmons, or even Horner–Wittig) reactions. This example is a reaction
that was used by some Japanese chemists in the synthesis of polyzonimine, a natural insect

The synthesis below offers a nice illustration of the contrasting selectivity of the two classes
of Wittig reagent. The female silkworm moth attracts mates by producing a pheromone
known as bombykol. Bombykol is an E,Z-diene, and in this synthesis two successive Wittig
reactions use fi rst a stabilized and second an unstabilized ylid to control the stereochemistry
of the product.

So why is there a change to E stereoselectivity when the ylid is stabilized? Again, the details
are still unclear, and there are several possible explanations. Here we give one which is gaining
ground, supported by recent experimental and computational evidence. It seems that, as with
unstabilized ylids, the stereochemistry of the alkene product is determined by the stereochemistry of the intermediate oxaphosphetane, which with stabilized ylids must be anti.

It used to be thought that the formation of the anti oxaphosphetane was under thermodynamic control, but it now seems likely that it too is formed stereoselectively under kinetic
control. The difference from the alkyl-substituted unstabilized ylids lies in the repulsion
experienced between the polarized C=O bond of the aldehyde and the electronegative stabilizing group shown here as an ester CO2R. As the four-membered ring fl attens out, the CO2R
and Ph groups end up on opposite sides of the four-membered ring.

In this chapter we have dealt for the fi rst time with the problem of producing compounds as
single stereoisomers—the stereoisomers concerned were geometrical isomers of alkenes. In
future chapters we shall look in more detail at making stereoisomers, but we shall move out
of two dimensions into three and consider reactions that exhibit diastereoselectivity and
enantioselectivity. Methods for controlling stereochemistry in two and in three dimensions
are closely related: single diastereoisomers are often made by addition reactions of single geometrical isomers of double bonds and, as you saw with the Peterson and Wittig reactions,
single diastereoisomers can lead stereospecifi cally to single geometrical isomers.

###### Creative chemistry

Chemistry is above all a creative science. Nearly all that you have learned so far in this book
has had one underlying aim: to teach you how to make molecules. This is after all what most
chemists do, for whatever reason. Small amounts of many drugs can be isolated from plants or
marine animals; much greater quantities are made by chemists in laboratories. A limited range
of dyes can be extracted from plants; many more vivid and permanent ones are made by chemists in the laboratory. Synthetic polymers, created by chemists, have replaced more expensive
and less durable alternatives like rubber. Despite the bad press it has received, the use of PVC as
insulating material for electric wires has prevented numerous fi res and saved many lives. Food
is healthier and people live longer because well-designed and controlled pesticides allow agriculture to supply copious quantities of disease-free food to the shelves of our shops, markets,
and supermarkets. Most of the improvements in the quality of life over the last 50 to 100 years
can be traced to new molecules created by chemists. But, faced with the challenge of making a
new compound, how do chemists go about deciding how to make it?
Synthetic planning starts with the product, which is fi xed and unchangeable, and works
backwards towards the starting materials. This process is called retrosynthesis, and the art of
planning the synthesis of a target molecule is called retrosynthetic analysis. The aim of this
chapter is to introduce you to the principles of retrosynthetic analysis: once you have read and
understood it you will be well on the way to designing your own organic syntheses.

###### Retrosynthetic analysis: synthesis backwards


Most of the chemistry you have learned so far has concentrated on reactions (questions like
‘What do you need to add to X to get Y?’) or on products (questions like ‘What will happen if X
and Y react together?’). Now we’re looking at starting materials (questions like ‘What X and Y
do you need to react together to make Z?’). We’re looking at reactions in reverse, and we have

**Z** **X + Y** a special symbol for a reverse reaction called a retrosynthetic arrow (the ‘implies’ arrow from

a retrosynthetic arrow logic). A scheme with a retrosynthetic arrow (margin) means ‘Z could be made from X plus Y’.

Here’s a very simple fi rst example. This compound is used as an insect repellent. As it’s an
ester, we know that it can be made from alcohol plus acyl chloride, and we can represent this
using a retrosynthetic arrow.

The aromatic amide amelfolide is a cardiac antiarrhythmic agent. Because we see that it is an
amide, we know that it can be made quite simply from p-nitrobenzoyl chloride and 2,6-dimethylaniline—again, we can represent this using a retrosynthetic arrow. Mentally breaking a molecule into its component parts like this is known as disconnection, and it’s helpful to indicate
the site of the disconnection with a wiggly line as we have here.

###### Disconnections must correspond to known, reliable reactions

The chemists who fi rst made amelfolide chose to make it from an amine and an acyl chloride because they knew that this reaction, a standard way of making an amide, had a very
good chance of success. They chose to disconnect the C–N bond because this disconnection
corresponds to a reliable reaction in a way that no other possible disconnection of this molecule does.
Now that you’ve seen the principle of retrosynthetic analysis at work, you should be able to
suggest a reasonable disconnection of the compound in the margin, known as daminozide.
You probably spotted immediately that daminozide is again an amide, so the best disconnection is the C–N bond, which could take us back to acyl chloride and dimethylhydrazine. This
time we’ve written ‘C–N amide’ above the retrosynthetic arrow as a reminder of why we’ve
made the disconnection and we advise you to follow this practice.



- This chapter will rely heavily
on the reactions you have met
earlier in the book, and should
therefore provide you with the
opportunity to revise them and
check you understand how they
work. If you come across a
reaction you aren’t familiar with,
look it up before carrying on to
the next one.

Now, in fact, there is a problem with this acyl chloride—it would be unstable as it can cyclize
to an anhydride. But this poses no problem for the synthesis of daminozide—we could just use
the anhydride instead, since the reaction should be just as reliable. A better retrosynthesis
therefore gives the anhydride and indeed this is how daminozide is made.

###### Synthons are idealized reagents

In the synthesis of daminozide an anhydride is used out of necessity rather than out of
choice, but it often turns out that there are several alternative reagents all corresponding to

Which reagent is best can often only be determined by experimentation—commercially,
paracetamol is made from _para-aminophenol and acetic anhydride largely because the by-_
product, acetic acid, is easier to handle than HCl. In a retrosynthetic analysis, we don’t really
want to be bothered by this sort of decision, which is best made later, so it’s useful to have a
single way of representing the key attributes of alternative reagents. We can depict both anhydride and acyl chloride in this scheme as an ‘idealized reagent’—an electrophilic acetyl group
MeCO[+].
We call such idealized reagents synthons. Synthons are fragments of molecules with an
associated polarity (represented by a ‘ + ‘ or ‘–’) which stand for the reagents we are going to
use in the forward synthesis. They are not themselves reagents, although they may occasionally turn out to be intermediates along the reaction pathway. By disconnecting bonds to
synthons rather than to actual reagents we can indicate the polarity of the bond-forming
reaction we are going to use without having to specify details of the reagents.

- You will fi nd that you learn
much more and much faster if
you try to do the retrosynthetic
analyses in this chapter as you
read it, before looking at the
suggested solutions. Use a piece
of paper to cover up the rest of
the page as you read, and write
some ideas down on another
piece of paper. Don’t just say
‘oh I can do that’ and move
on—you’ll miss out on the
chance of teaching yourself a lot
of chemistry. Don’t waste the
opportunity! Next time you read
this chapter you’ll have your
memory as an aid—and
retrosynthetic analysis isn’t about
remembering; it’s about
deducing. Another important
thing about retrosynthetic
analysis is that there is rarely one
single ‘right’ answer, so even if
your suggestions don’t match up
with ours, don’t be discouraged.
Aim to learn from the points
where your attempts differ from
our suggestions.


We can apply these ideas to the synthesis of the herbicide 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
acid). The most reasonable disconnection of an ether is the C–O bond because we know that
ethers can be made from alkyl halides by substitution with an alkoxide anion. We don’t at
this stage need to decide exactly which alkyl halide or alkoxide to use, so we just write the
synthons.
Once the retrosynthetic analysis is done, we can go back and use our knowledge of chemistry to think of reagents corresponding to these synthons. Here, for example, we should certainly choose the anion of the phenol as the nucleophile and some functionalized acetic acid
molecule with a leaving group in the α position.

search of the chemical literature and do some experiments. However, all of the syntheses in

###### Choosing a disconnection

The hardest task in designing a retrosynthetic analysis is spotting where to make the disconnections. We shall offer some guidelines to help you, but the best way to learn is through
experience and practice. The overall aim of retrosynthetic analysis is to get back to starting
materials that are available from chemical suppliers, and to do this as effi ciently as possible.



- **Guideline 1**

**Disconnections must correspond to known, reliable reactions.**


We have already mentioned that disconnections must correspond to known reliable reactions and it’s the most important thing to bear in mind when working out a retrosynthesis.
When we disconnected the ether 2,4-D we chose to disconnect next to the oxygen atom
because we know about the synthesis of ethers. We chose not to disconnect on the aryl side of
the oxygen atom because we know of no reliable reaction corresponding to nucleophilic
attack of an alcohol on an unactivated aromatic ring.

- **Guideline 2**

**For compounds consisting of two parts joined by a heteroatom, disconnect next to the**
**heteroatom.**


In all the retrosynthetic analyses you’ve seen so far there is a heteroatom (N or O) joining the
rest of the molecule together, and in each case we made the disconnection next to that N or O.
This guideline works for esters, amides, ethers, amines, acetals, sulfi des, and so on because
these compounds are often made by a substitution reaction. Chlorbenside is used to kill ticks
and mites. Using Guideline 2 we can suggest a disconnection next to the sulfur atom; using
Guideline 1 we know that we must disconnect on the alkyl and not on the aryl side.

The next example is the ethyl ester of, and precursor to, cetaben, a drug that can be used to
lower blood lipid levels. It is an amine, so we disconnect next to the nitrogen atom.

###### Multiple step syntheses: avoid chemoselectivity problems

The next compound was an intermediate in the synthesis of the potential anti-obesity drug
ICI-D7114. You can spot that, with two ethers and an amine functional group, it requires
several disconnections to take it back to simple compounds. The question is, which do we do
fi rst? One way to solve the problem is to write down all the possibilities and see which looks
best. Here there are four reasonable disconnections: one at each of the ether groups (a and b)
or on either side of the amine (c and d).

Both (a) and (b) pose problems of chemoselectivity as it would be hard to alkylate the phenol
in the presence of the basic nitrogen atom. Between (c) and (d), (c) appears to be the better
choice because the next disconnection after (d) will have to be an alkylation of O in the presence of an NH2 group. To avoid chemoselectivity problems like this, we want to try to intro_duce reactive groups late in the synthesis. In terms of retrosynthetic analysis, then, we can_
formulate another guideline.



- **Guideline 3**

**Consider alternative disconnections and choose routes that avoid chemoselectivity problems—**
**often this means disconnecting reactive groups fi rst.**


This guideline helps us in the next retrosynthetic step for the ICI-D7114 intermediate.
Disconnection (c) gave us a compound with two ethers that might be disconnected further by
disconnection (e) or (f ).

Disconnection (e) requires alkylation of a compound that is itself an alkylating agent.
Disconnection (f) is much more satisfactory and leads to a compound that is easily disconnected to 4-hydroxyphenol and 1,2-dibromoethane. Using Guideline 3, we can say that it’s
best to disconnect the bromoethyl group (f) before the benzyl group (g) because the bromoethyl group is more reactive and more likely to cause problems of chemoselectivity.

###### Functional group interconversion

The antihypertensive drug ofornine contains an amide and an amine functional group, and
we need to decide which to disconnect fi rst. If we disconnect the secondary amine fi rst (b), we
will have chemoselectivity problems constructing the amide in the presence of the resulting
NH2 group.

Yet disconnection (a), on the face of it, seems to pose an even greater problem because we
now have to construct an amine in the presence of an acyl chloride! However, we shall want
to make the acyl chloride from the carboxylic acid, which can then easily be disconnected to
2-aminobenzoic acid (anthranilic acid) and 4-chloropyridine.

The retrosynthetic transformation of an acyl chloride to a carboxylic acid is not really a
disconnection because nothing is being disconnected. We call it instead a functional group
interconversion, or FGI, as written above the retrosynthetic arrow. Functional group interconversions often aid disconnections because the sort of reactive functional groups (acyl
chlorides, alkyl halides) we want in starting materials are not desirable in compounds to be
disconnected because they pose chemoselectivity problems. They are also useful if the target
molecule contains functional groups that are not easily disconnected.

By using an appropriate reagent or series of reagents, almost any functional group can be
converted into any other. You should already have a fair grasp of reasonable functional group
interconversions. They mostly fall into the categories of oxidations, reductions, and substitutions (Chapters 10, 11, 15, and 23).

###### Amine synthesis using functional group interconversions

The synthesis of amines poses a special problem because only in certain cases is the obvious
disconnection successful.

**H** **C–N amine**
**R[1]** **N** **R[2]** **R[1]** **NH2** + **X** **R[2]**


The problem is that the product is usually more reactive than the starting material and
there is a danger that multiple alkylation will take place.

nucleophilic than primary amine **R[2]** **X**

The few successful examples you have seen so far in this chapter have been exceptions, for
either steric or electronic reasons, and from now on we advise you to avoid disconnecting an
amine in this way. Sometimes further alkylation is made unfavourable by the increased steric
hindrance that would result: this is probably the case for the cetaben ethyl ester we made by
this reaction.

If the alkylating agent contains an inductive electron-withdrawing group, the product may
be less reactive than the starting material—benzylamine was only alkylated once by the alkyl
bromide in the synthesis of ICI-D7114 on p. 699 because of the electron-withdrawing effect of
the aryloxy group.
What are the alternatives? There are two main ones, and both involve functional group
interconversion, with the reactive amine being converted to a less reactive derivative
before disconnection. The fi rst solution is to convert the amine to an amide and then
disconnect that. The reduction of amide to amine is quite reliable, so the FGI is a reasonable one.

The second alternative is to convert to an imine, which can be disconnected to amine plus

There are several conceivable routes to the neuroactive drug fenfl uramine—one analysis,
which uses both the amide and the imine FGI methods, is shown below and this is the route
used to make the drug. Notice that the oxime is used instead of the imine. N-unsubstituted
imines are very unstable, and the much more stable—indeed isolable—oxime serves the same
purpose. Oximes are generally reduced with LiAlH4.

You should now be able to suggest a plausible analysis of the secondary amine terodilin. The
structure is in the margin; write down a retrosynthetic analysis and suggested synthesis
before looking at the actual synthesis below.
You should fi nd yourself quite restricted in choice: the amide route clearly works only if
there is a CH2 group next to the nitrogen (this comes from the C=O reduction), so we have to
use an imine.

In the synthesis of terodilin, it was not necessary to isolate the imine—reduction of imines
is faster than reduction of ketones, so formation of the imine in the presence of a mild reducing agent (usually NaCNBH3 or catalytic hydrogenation) can give the amine directly.

###### Two-group disconnections are better than one-group disconnections

This compound was needed for some research into the mechanisms of rearrangements. We
can disconnect on either side of the ether oxygen atom, but (b) is much better because (a) does
not correspond to a reliable reaction: it might be hard to control selective alkylation of the
primary hydroxyl group in the presence of the secondary one.

You might think that the best reagent to use as the equivalent of the synthon B would be
bromide C. Be more ingenious! A much better solution is to use the epoxide D. Nucleophilic
attack on the less hindered terminal carbon atom of the epoxide gives us the type of compound we want, and this was how the target molecule was made.
In using the epoxide we have gone one step beyond all the disconnections we have talked
about so far because we have used one functional group to help disconnect another—in other words,
we noticed the alcohol adjacent to the ether we wanted to disconnect and managed to involve
them both in the disconnection. Such disconnections are known as two-group disconnections,
and you should always be on the look-out for opportunities of using them because they are an
effi cient way of getting back to simple starting materials. We call this epoxide disconnection a
1,2-disconnection because the two functional groups in the two-group disconnection are in a
1,2-relationship.

Drug molecules often have 1,2-related functional groups: 2-amino alcohols form one
important class. Phenyramidol, for example, is a muscle relaxant. A simple two-group disconnection takes it straight back to 2-amino pyridine and styrene oxide.

Notice that we have written ‘1,2-diX’ above the arrow to show that it’s a two-group (‘diX’)
disconnection—we’ve also numbered the carbon atoms in the starting material to show the
1,2-relationship. It may seem trivial in such a simple example, but it’s a useful part of the
process of writing retrosynthetic analyses because it helps you to spot opportunities for making two-group disconnections.

###### 1,2-Disconnections

The drug propranolol is a beta-blocker that reduces blood pressure and was once one of the
top-selling drugs worldwide. It has two 1,2-relationships in its structure but it is best to disconnect the more reactive amine group fi rst. The second disconnection can’t make use of an
epoxide, but a simple ether disconnection takes us back to 1-naphthol and epichlorohydrin, a
common starting material for this type of compound.



- The observant among you
may now be questioning why this
synthesis is successful—after all,
we have made a secondary
amine by alkylating a primary
one with an epoxide—exactly
the sort of thing we advised
against on p. 700. Alkylations
with epoxides usually stop after
the fi rst step because the
inductively electron-withdrawing
hydroxyl group in the product
makes it less nucleophilic than
the starting material. In the
synthesis of ICID7114
intermediate on p. 699, it’s this
same effect that prevents the
amine being multiply alkylated.


###### Epichlorohydrin

Epichlorohydrin is a useful starting material for 1,2,3-substituted
compounds. The epoxide is more
electrophilic than the C–Cl bond,
and the mechanism of the fi rst
step of the synthesis is surprising.

Moxnidazole is an antiparasitic drug, and our next target molecule is an important intermediate in its synthesis. The obvious fi rst disconnection is of the carbamate group, revealing

###### 1,2-Disconnections with carbonyl compounds

Just as epoxides are useful reagents for synthon A, so α-halocarbonyl compounds are useful
reagents for the carbonyl equivalent, synthon B. We can consider disconnection to this synthon to be a two-group disconnection because the α-halocarbonyl compounds are easily
made by halogenation of a ketone, ester, or carboxylic acid (see Chapter 20) and the carbonyl
group adjacent to the halide makes them extremely reactive electrophiles (Chapter 15).
Nafi midone is an anticonvulsant drug with an obvious two-group disconnection of this
type. The α-chloroketone is simply made by chlorination, and substitution is rapid and
effi cient even with the weakly basic (Chapter 8) heterocycle imidazole.

The synthesis requires a normal bromination of a carbonyl compound in acid solution but
the next step is a most unusual SN2 reaction at a tertiary centre. This happens because of the

groups must be thought of as working together in this type of synthesis.

This type of reaction is available only when the alkene is conjugated to an electron-withdrawing group—usually carbonyl, but it can be nitro, cyanide, etc. (Chapter 22). This disconnection is available only at this oxidation level. We can do a two-group 1,3-disconnection on
this sulfi de, for example.

similar to the ‘deadly nightshade’ drug, atropine, which has the ability to calm involuntary
muscle movements. There is a 1,3-relationship between the amine and ketone functional
groups, and 1,3-disconnection takes us back to piperidine and an unsaturated ketone.

Before we leave C–X disconnections and go on to look at C–C disconnections we should just
review some important points. We suggested three guidelines for choosing disconnections
and now that you have met the principle of two-group disconnections, we can add a fourth:



- **Guidelines for good disconnections**

**1 Disconnections must correspond to known, reliable reactions.**

**2 For compounds consisting of two parts joined by a heteroatom, disconnect next to the**
**heteroatom.**

**3 Consider alternative disconnections and choose routes that avoid chemoselectivity**
**problems—often this means disconnecting reactive groups fi rst.**

**4 Use two-group disconnections wherever possible.**


Two-group disconnections reduce the complexity of a target molecule more effi ciently
than one-group disconnections, and you should always be on the look-out for them. You will
meet more two-group disconnections in the next section, which deals with how to disconnect C–C bonds.

###### C–C disconnections

The disconnections we have made so far have all been of C–O, C–N, or C–S bonds, but, of
course, the most important reactions in organic synthesis are those that build the carbon skeleton by forming C–C bonds. We can analyse C–C disconnections in much the same way as
we’ve analysed C–X disconnections. Consider, for example, how you might make the simple
compound in the margin, which is an intermediate in the synthesis of a carnation perfume.
The only functional group is the triple bond, and we shall want to use the chemistry of
alkynes to show us where to disconnect. You know that alkylation of alkynes is a reliable
reaction, so a sensible disconnection is next to the triple bond.

It’s often a good idea to start retrosynthetic analysis of target molecules containing isolated double bonds by considering FGI to the alkyne because C–C disconnections can
then become quite easy. The cis-alkene below is an intermediate in the synthesis of a component of violet oil. FGI to the alkyne reveals two further disconnections that make use
of alkyne alkylations. The reagent we need for the fi rst of these is, of course, the epoxide
as there is a 1,2-relationship between the OH group and the alkyne.

Disconnection on either side of the alkyne leads us back to a bromo-alcohol alkylating
agent. In the synthesis of the pheromone, it turned out to be best if the hydroxyl group was
protected as its THP ether. You should be able to think of other alkylation-type reactions that
you have met that proceed reliably and therefore provide a good basis for a disconnection—
the alkylation of enolates of esters or ketones, for example (Chapter 25).

###### 1,2 C–C disconnections


This next ester was needed for a synthesis of the sedative rogletimide (see later for the full
synthesis). The ethyl group is disconnected because it can be readily introduced by alkylation
of the ester enolate.

We have labelled the disconnection ‘1,2 C–C’ because the new C–C bond is forming two
atoms away from the carbonyl group. To spot disconnections of this sort, you need to look for
alkyl groups in this 2-position.
Arildone is a drug that prevents polio and herpes simplex viruses from ‘unwrapping’ their

With two carbonyl groups, the alkylation should be particularly straightforward since we

We introduced the chemistry of malonate esters in Chapters 20 and 25 as a useful way of

This organophosphorus compound, belfosil, is a Ca[2][+] channel blocker. You haven’t
met many phosphorus compounds yet, but you should be able to reason that a good disconnection will be the C–P bond by analogy with the sulfi des you met earlier in the chapter. We could use bromide as a leaving group, but alkyl bromides are inconvenient to
disconnect further, so we go back to the more versatile diol—in the forward synthesis we
shall need a way of making the OH groups into good leaving groups. There is still no obvious disconnection of the diol, but FGI to the ester oxidation level reveals a malonate
derivative.

Notice how we disconnected the phosphorus-based functional groups straight back to alcohols in the retrosynthetic analysis, and not, say, to alkyl halides. Oxygen-based functional
groups (alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, and acids) have one important property in common—versatility. They are easily converted into each other by oxidation and reduction, and
into other groups by substitution. What is more, many of the C–C disconnections you will
meet correspond to reactions of oxygen-based groups, and particularly carbonyl groups.
Faced with an unusual functional group in a target molecule the best thing to do is convert it
to an oxygen-based group at the same oxidation level—it usually makes subsequent C–C
disconnections simpler. So we add a new guideline.



- **Guideline 5**

**Convert to oxygen-based functional groups to facilitate C–C disconnections.**


In each of the cases you have met so far, we have used a functional group present in the
molecule to help us to disconnect the C–C bond using a 1,2 C–C disconnection. You can look
for 1,2 C–C disconnections in alkynes, carbonyl compounds, and alkylated aromatic rings.
And, if the target isn’t a carbonyl compound, consider what would be possible if functional
groups such as hydroxyl groups were converted to carbonyl groups (just as we did with
belfosdil).

###### 1,1 C–C disconnections

All of these disconnections relied on the reaction of a carbon electrophile with a nucleophilic functional group. The alternative, reaction of a carbon nucleophile (such as a Grignard
reagent) with an electrophilic functional group, allows us to do C–C disconnections on
alcohols. For example, this compound, which has a fragrance reminiscent of lilac, is a useful
perfume in soap because (unlike many other perfumes that are aldehydes or ketones) it is
stable to alkali.

We look to the one functional group, the hydroxyl, to tell us where to disconnect, and disconnection next to the OH group gives two synthons for which sensible reagents are a
Grignard reagent and acetone. The perfume is made from benzyl chloride and acetone in this
way. Notice that we label these disconnections 1,1 C–C because the bond being disconnected
is attached to the same carbon atom as the hydroxyl functional group.

###### Double disconnections can be a short cut

Tertiary alcohols with two identical groups next to the hydroxyl group are often made by attack
of two equivalents of a Grignard reagent on an ester. The synthesis of the antihistamine compound fenpiprane provides an example: the tertiary alcohol is a precursor to the drug and can be
disconnected to ester + Grignard reagent because of the two Ph groups. The ester required has a
1,3 functional group relationship, and can be disconnected to amine plus Michael acceptor.

###### Available starting materials

Although any of the three routes to the ‘fruity peony perfume’ on p. 710 would give an acceptable synthesis, the key factor in choosing route (c) was the ease of synthesis of the starting
materials from available compounds. But how can you know which materials will be available? So far in this chapter we have avoided this question, and often our retrosynthetic analyses have been incomplete because the suggested starting materials must themselves be
synthesized in the laboratory. From now on, however, we will take every analysis back to
available starting materials to help you get a feel for what is, and is not, available.
The only way to be absolutely sure what you can buy is to look up a compound in a supplier’s
catalogue, and this is what a chemist would do when assessing possible alternative synthetic
routes. A good rule of thumb is that compounds with up to about six carbon atoms and
**with one functional group (alcohol, aldehyde, ketone, acid, amine, double bond, or alkyl**
halide) are usually available. This is less true for heavily branched compounds, but most
straight-chain compounds with these functional groups are available up to eight or more
carbon atoms. Cyclic compounds with one functional group from fi ve-to eight-membered are
also available. Of course, many other compounds are available too, including some difunctional compounds. Here are a few of them.

###### Donor and acceptor synthons

You’ve now met a variety of synthons and it’s useful to be able to classify them as donor or accep_tor synthons. We call a negatively polarized synthon a donor synthon and give it the symbol_
‘d’. Positively polarized synthons are called acceptor synthons and are given the symbol ‘a’.
We can classify the synthons further according to where the functional group is in relation
to the reactive site. The fi rst synthon in the diagram below, which corresponds to an aldehyde,
we call an a[1] synthon because it is an acceptor that carries a functional group on the same
carbon as its reactive centre. The second is a d[2] synthon because it is a donor whose reacting
site is in the 2-position relative to the carbonyl group. Earlier you met two other types of synthon, corresponding to epoxide and Michael acceptor, and we can now classify these as a[2] and
a[3] synthons.

This terminology is useful because it reduces synthons to the bare essentials: what polarity
they are and where the polarity is sited. The actual functional group they carry is, as you now
appreciate, less important because FGI will usually allow us to turn one functional group into
another.



- **Synthons are classifi ed as a (acceptor) or d (donor)**

**A number shows the position of the acceptor or donor site relative to a functional group.**

###### Two-group C–C disconnections

 1,3-Difunctionalized compounds

It’s not only Grignard reagents that will react with aldehydes or ketones to make alcohols:
enolates will too—we spent Chapter 26 discussing this reaction, the aldol reaction, its variants, and ways to control it.

The aldol reaction is extremely important in organic synthesis because it makes compounds
with two functional groups in a 1,3-relationship. Whenever you spot this 1,3-relationship in
a target molecule—think aldol! In disconnection terms we can represent it like this.

We call this disconnection a two-group C–C disconnection because we are using the OH
and the C=O groups together to guide our disconnection. The disconnection gives us a d[2]
synthon, for which we shall use an enolate equivalent, and an a[1] synthon, for which we shall
use an aldehyde or a ketone. Chapter 26 has many examples and perhaps gingerol is the best.
As soon as you see the 1,3-relationship, the disconnection should be obvious.

The β-hydroxy carbonyl products of aldol reactions are often very easily dehydrated to give
α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and if you spot an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group in
the molecule, you should aim to make it by an aldol reaction. You will fi rst need to do an FGI
to the β-hydroxy carbonyl compound, then disconnect as before.

The next compound was needed for an early synthesis of carotene. Again, it’s an α,βunsaturated ketone so we can disconnect using the same ‘α,β’ disconnection. The aldehyde
generated by this fi rst disconnection is also α,β-unsaturated, so we can do another α,β disconnection, back to a ketone whose synthesis we have already discussed (p. 708).

- If you don’t understand what
we are saying here, you must go
back and read Chapter 26 on
selectivity in the aldol reaction.


There was no problem with selectivity in the second aldol reaction because the aldehyde is
not enolizable. The Reformatsky reaction in this sequence illustrates the fact that, as you saw
in Chapter 26, aldol-type reactions happen at the ester oxidation level as well, and you should
equally look to disconnect β-hydroxy or α,β-unsaturated esters, acids, or nitriles in this way.
Just remember to look for 1,3-relationships, convert the functional groups to oxygen-based
ones, and disconnect them to d[2] plus a[1] synthons.
The next compound was needed when chemists were developing a thromboxane antagonist
to inhibit blood clot formation. You can immediately spot the 1,3-relationship between the
ester and the hydroxyl group, so 1,3-diO disconnection is called for.

This unsaturated amide is known as cinfl umide and is a muscle relaxant. Disconnection of

The diester has a 1,3-diCO relationship and could be disconnected but we have in mind
using malonate so we would rather disconnect the alternative 3-amino carbonyl compound
(the Me2N group has a 1,3-relationship with both ester groups) by a 1,3-diX disconnection
giving an unsaturated ester. This α,β-unsaturated ester disconnects nicely to a heterocyclic

Venlafaxine is an antidepressant and, like many neuroactive agents, it is an amino-alcohol.
In this case, the two functional groups are 1,3-related, so we aim to use a 1,3-diO disconnection. Usually, you would convert the amine to an alcohol to simplify the disconnection, but

In the forward synthesis, it turned out that the nitrile reduction was best done using hydrogen and a metal (Rh) catalyst. The fi nal methylation of the primary amine had to be done via
the imine and iminium ion (see Chapter 23) to prevent further unwanted alkylations. The
reagent was an excess of formaldehyde (methanal CH2=O) in the presence of formic acid
(HCO2H), which acts as a reducing agent.

###### Aldol-style disconnections with N and O in a 1,3-relationship: II—the Mannich reaction

Another important reaction for making amines with a 1,3-relationship to a carbonyl group is
the Mannich reaction. You met this reaction in Chapter 26 as a way of doing otherwise unreliable aldol additions to formaldehyde. Because the amine is introduced directly and not by
reduction of a nitrile, it can have two alkyl groups from the start. Compare this scheme with
the one above using a nitrile group as the source of the amine.

You can immediately spot the 1,3 relationship in this analogue of the antidepressant nisoxetine, but, unfortunately, it can’t be disconnected straight back to an amino-alcohol because

because the Mannich reaction will produce the amine directly.

###### The Claisen ester disconnection: a 1,3-diO relationship needing two carbonyl groups

1,3-Diketones can be disconnected in a similar way: this time the disconnection corresponds
to a Claisen condensation, but it’s still 1,3-diO and again you need to look out for the 1,3
relationship. The synthons are still d[2] plus a[1] but the a[1] synthon is used at the ester oxidation
level. This diketone is the starting material for the synthesis of the antidepressant tazadolene.
With 1,3-diketones, there’s always a choice where to disconnect, and you should be guided by
which disconnection (a) corresponds to the most reliable reaction and (b) gives the simplest
starting materials. In this case, it’s much better to disconnect back to cyclohexanone.

The synthesis is interesting because, after the acylation of the enamine, the amino group is
introduced by a clever reductive amination with benzylamine (PhCH2NH2) that forms the
C–N bond, reduces the ketone, and hydrogenolyses the _N-benzyl bond (Chapter 23)._
Dehydration and double alkylation then gives tazadolene. Step 3, the attack of benzylamine
on the diketone, has interesting chemoselectivity. Only the ketone in the six-membered ring
is attacked while the less reactive conjugated phenyl ketone is not affected.

###### 1,5-Related functional groups

This compound has a 1,5 rather than a 1,3 relationship between two carbonyl groups.
Disconnection to give an enolate as one reagent therefore requires an a[3] rather than an a[1]
synthon: in other words a Michael acceptor.

As discussed in Chapter 25, the synthesis will be successful only if (a) the right reagent
enolizes and (b) the nucleophile undergoes conjugate (and not direct 1,2-) addition to the
unsaturated carbonyl compound. Malonate derivatives enolize easily and do Michael additions and are therefore a good choice for this type of reaction.

Michael addition of enolates to α,β-unsaturated compounds is a good way of making
1,5-difunctionalized compounds, and you should look for these 1,5-relationships in target
molecules with a view to making them in this way. Our example is rogletimide, a sedative that
can be disconnected to a 1,5-diester. Further 1,5-diCO disconnection gives a compound we
made earlier by ethylation of the ester enolate.

Notice that the acceptor synthons have odd numbers; the donor synthon has an even
number: donor and acceptor properties alternate along the chain as we move away from a
carbonyl group. This ‘natural reactivity’ of carbonyl compounds explains why we fi nd it
easy to discuss ways of making 1,3- and 1,5-difunctionalized compounds—because they
arise from a[1] + d[2] and from a[3] + d[2]. Reagents corresponding to synthons like d[1] or a[2] are
rarer, and therefore compounds with 1,2- or 1,4-related functional groups require special
consideration retrosynthetically.
You have in fact met one example of each of the ‘unnatural’ synthons with a[2] and d[1] reactivity. Such synthons are given the German name umpolung, meaning ‘inverse polarity’, because
their natural reactivity is reversed, and umpolung reagents are the key to the synthesis of
1,2- and 1,4-difunctionalized compounds.

We shall fi nish this chapter by looking at disconnections of 1,2- and 1,4-difunctionalized
compounds because these require us to use reagents with umpolung equivalent to d[1], d[3], a[2],
and a[4] synthons. There are very many reagents for these synthons—if you are interested to
learn more, consult a specialized book.

###### 1,2-Difunctional compounds

You met ways of making 1,2-difunctionalized compounds when we fi rst talked about twogroup disconnections, and we used an epoxide as an a[2] synthon. Epoxides are, of course, also
1,2-functionalized, and in fact this is often the key to making 1,2-functionalized compounds:
use something with the 1,2 relationship already in place. You saw lots of examples of this type
of strategy earlier in this chapter. Perhaps the simplest approach is electrophilic addition to
alkenes. If the alkene is made by a Wittig reaction, the disconnection is (eventually) between
the two functionalized carbon atoms in the target molecule. This example shows dihydroxylation as the electrophilic addition but there is also epoxidation, bromination, and bromination
in water to give Br and OH as the functional groups.

A normal C–C disconnection is also a possibility, but disconnection to the ‘natural’ a[1] synthon and the umpolung d[1] is necessary. One very useful umpolung reagent is cyanide, and
you can see it in action in this synthesis of the tranquillizer phenaglycodol. The tertiary alcohol with two R groups the same should prompt you to think of doing a double Grignard addition to an ester. FGI then reveals the nitrile functional group necessary for a 1,2-diX
disconnection to cyanide plus ketone.

The starting material is obviously available by a Friedel–Crafts acylation of chlorobenzene

group destroys some of it.

###### 1,4-Difunctional compounds

There are more possibilities here and we shall fi nish this chapter with a brief analysis of them
to show you how much of this subject lies beyond what we can do in this book.

We can use an enolate for one reagent but the other will have to have umpolung. This is not
a very diffi cult kind of umpolung as an α-bromo carbonyl compound will do the job nicely if
we select our enol(ate) equivalent carefully. In Chapter 25 we suggested enamines for this job.
The synthesis becomes:

If we attempt the disconnection of one of the other bonds, two possibilities are available

umpolung in the synthesis of a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound. If you were making this keto-ester

this product by quite a short route. This strategy is available only if there happens to be a starting material available to suit any particular case.

###### To conclude...

The best synthetic route to a molecule cannot be predicted with certainty. Retrosynthetic
analysis allows you to suggest several different strategies for any given target molecule, and
thorough literature searching plus experimentation in the laboratory will allow you to whittle the possibilities down to the most likely to succeed. Thinking like this underpins the
design of syntheses of molecules, from the relatively simple molecules forming the next generation of drugs or agrochemicals to the most complex molecules known. Retrosynthetic
thinking also reinforces the concept that the combination of electrophile and nucleophile is
the basis for the understanding of organic reactions. Synthesis and reactions are two sides of
the same coin. From now on we shall use the methods and terminology introduced in this
chapter when we think that they will help you to develop your understanding.

###### Introduction

Benzene is aromatic because it has six electrons in a cyclic conjugated system. We know it is
aromatic because it is exceptionally stable, it has a ring current and hence large chemical
shifts in the proton NMR spectrum, and it has special chemistry involving substitution rather
than addition with electrophiles. This chapter and the next are about the very large number
of other aromatic systems in which one or more atoms in the benzene ring are replaced by
heteroatoms such as N, O, and S. There are thousands of these systems with fi ve- and sixmembered rings, and we will examine just a few.

Our subject is aromatic heterocycles and it is important that we treat it seriously because
most—probably about two-thirds of—organic compounds belong to this class, and they number among them some of the most signifi cant compounds for human beings. If we think only
of drugs we can defi ne the history of medicine by heterocycles. Even in the sixteenth century
quinine was used to prevent and treat malaria, although the structure of the drug was not
known. The fi rst synthetic drug was antipyrine (1887) for the reduction of fevers. The fi rst
effective antibiotic was sulfapyridine (1938). The fi rst multi-million pound drug (1970s) was
Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug, and among the most topical of current drugs is Viagra (1997) for
treatment of male impotence.
All these compounds have heterocyclic aromatic rings shown in black. Three have single
rings, fi ve- or six-membered, two have fi ve- or six-membered rings fused together. The number of nitrogens in the rings varies from one to four. We will start by looking at the simple
six-membered ring with one nitrogen atom: pyridine.

###### Aromaticity survives when parts of benzene’s ring are replaced by nitrogen atoms

There is no doubt that benzene is aromatic. Now we must ask: how can we insert a heteroatom
into the ring and retain aromaticity? What kind of atom is needed? If we want to replace one
of the carbon atoms of benzene with a heteroatom, we need an atom that can be trigonal to
keep the fl at hexagonal ring, and that has a p orbital to keep the six delocalized electrons.
Nitrogen fi ts all of these requirements. This is what happens if we replace a CH group in benzene with a nitrogen atom.

###### Nomenclature

One of the most annoying
things about heterocyclic chemistry is the mass of what appear
to be illogical names. You should
not, of course, attempt to learn
them all, but a basic idea of how
they are designed will help you.
We will give you a guide on
which names to learn shortly.
For the moment accept that
‘amine’ ends in ‘-ine’ and any
heterocyclic compound whose
name ends in ‘-ine’ is a nitrogen
heterocycle. The syllable ‘azo-’
also implies nitrogen and ‘pyr-’
(usually) implies a six-membered
ring (except in pyrrole!).


**H** **N**

The orbitals in the ring have not changed in position or shape and we still have the six electrons from the three double bonds. One obvious difference is that nitrogen is trivalent and
thus there is no NH bond. Instead, a lone pair of electrons occupies the space of the C–H bond
in benzene.
In theory then, pyridine is aromatic. But is it in real life? The most important evidence
comes from the proton NMR spectrum. The six protons of benzene resonate at 7.27 ppm,
some 2 ppm downfi eld from the alkene region, clear evidence for a ring current (Chapter 13).
Pyridine is not as symmetrical as benzene but the three types of proton all resonate in the
same region. As we will see, pyridine is also very stable and, by any reasonable assessment,
pyridine is aromatic.
We could continue the process of replacing, on paper, more CH groups with nitrogen atoms,
and would fi nd three new aromatic heterocycles: pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine:

There is another way in which we might transform benzene into a heterocycle. Instead of
using just one electron from N to replace an electron in the π system, we could use nitrogen’s
lone pair of electrons to replace two electrons in the π system. We can substitute a CH=CH
unit in benzene with a nitrogen atom providing that we can use the lone pair in the delocalized system. This means putting it into a p orbital. We still have the four electrons from the


-----

remaining double bonds and, with the two electrons of the lone pair on nitrogen, that makes
six in all. The nitrogen atom must still be trigonal with the lone pair in a p orbital so the N–H
bond is in the plane of the fi ve-membered ring.

The [1]H NMR spectrum of pyrrole is slightly less convincing as the two types of proton on the
ring resonate at higher fi eld (6.5 and 6.2 ppm) than those of benzene or pyridine but they still
fall in the aromatic rather than the alkene region. Pyrrole is also more reactive towards electrophiles than benzene or pyridine, but it does the usual aromatic substitution reactions (Friedel–
Crafts, nitration, halogenation) rather than addition reactions: pyrrole is also aromatic.
Inventing heterocycles by further replacement of CH groups by nitrogen in pyrrole leads to
two compounds, pyrazole and imidazole, after one replacement, to two triazoles after two
replacements, and to a single tetrazole after three.

All of these compounds are generally accepted as aromatic too as they broadly have the
NMR spectra and reactivities expected for aromatic compounds. As you may expect, introducing heteroatoms into the aromatic ring and, even more, changing the ring size actually
affect the chemistry a great deal. We must now return to pyridine and work our way more
slowly through the chemistry of these important heterocycles to establish the principles that
govern their behaviour.

###### More nomenclature

The ending ‘-ole’ is systematic and refers to a fi ve-membered heterocyclic ring. All the fi ve-membered aromatic heterocycles with nitrogen in the ring are sometimes called ‘the azoles’. Oxazole and thiazole are used for the oxygen and sulfur
analogues of imidazole.

###### Pyridine is a very unreactive aromatic imine

The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring is planar and trigonal with the lone pair in the plane
of the ring. This makes it an imine. Most of the imines you have met before (in Chapter 11, for
example), have been unstable intermediates in carbonyl group reactions, but in pyridine we
have a stable imine—stable because of its aromaticity. All imines are more weakly basic than
saturated amines and pyridine is a weak base with a pKa (for its conjugate acid) of 5.5. This
means that the pyridinium ion is about as strong an acid as a carboxylic acid.

- Pyridine is also toxic and has
a foul smell—so there are
disadvantages in using pyridine
as a solvent. But it is cheap and
remains a popular solvent in
spite of the problems.

Pyridine is a reasonable nucleophile for carbonyl groups and is often used as a nucleophilic

Pyridine is nucleophilic at the nitrogen atom because the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen can_not be delocalized around the ring. They are in an sp[2] orbital orthogonal to the p orbitals in the_
ring and there is no interaction between orthogonal orbitals. Try it for yourself, drawing
arrows. All attempts to delocalize the electrons lead to impossible results!

- **The lone pair of pyridine’s nitrogen atom is not delocalized.**


Our main question about the reactivity of pyridine must be this: what does the nitrogen
atom do to the rest of the ring? The important orbitals—the p orbitals of the aromatic system—
are superfi cially the same as in benzene, but the more electronegative nitrogen atom will lower
the energy of all the orbitals. Lower-energy fi lled orbitals mean a less reactive nucleophile but

of pyridine. It is less reactive than benzene in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, but
nucleophilic substitution, which is diffi cult for benzene, comes easily to pyridine.

###### Pyridine is bad at electrophilic aromatic substitution

The lower energy of the orbitals of pyridine’s π system means that electrophilic attack on
the ring is diffi cult. Another way to look at this is to see that the nitrogen atom destabilizes the cationic would-be intermediate, especially when it can be delocalized onto
nitrogen.

An equally serious problem is that the nitrogen lone pair is basic and a reasonably good
nucleophile—this is the basis for its role as a nucleophilic catalyst in acylations. The normal
reagents for electrophilic substitution reactions, such as nitration, are acidic. Treatment of
pyridine with the usual mixture of HNO3 and H2SO4 merely protonates the nitrogen atom.
Pyridine itself is not very reactive towards electrophiles: the pyridinium ion is totally
unreactive.

Other reactions, such as Friedel–Crafts acylations, require Lewis acids and these too react at

- **Pyridine does not undergo electrophilic substitution**

**Aromatic electrophilic substitution on pyridine is not a useful reaction. The ring is unreactive**
**and the electrophilic reagents attack nitrogen, making the ring even less reactive. Avoid**
**nitration, sulfonation, halogenation, and Friedel–Crafts reactions on simple pyridines.**


###### Nucleophilic substitution is easy with pyridines

By contrast, the nitrogen atom makes pyridines more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution, particularly at the 2- and 4-positions, by lowering the LUMO energy of the π system of
pyridine. You can see this effect in action in the ease of replacement of halogens in these positions by nucleophiles.

The intermediate anion is stabilized by electronegative nitrogen and by delocalization round
the ring. These reactions have some similarity to nucleophilic aromatic substitution (Chapter
22) but are more similar to carbonyl reactions. The intermediate anion is a tetrahedral intermediate that loses the best leaving group to regenerate the stable aromatic system. Nucleophiles
such as amines or thiolate anions work well in these reactions.

The fi rst step is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. In the second step the nitro group is
reduced to an amino group without any effect on the pyridine ring—another piece of evidence for its aromaticity. Finally, the one amino group whose lone pair is not delocalized onto
the pyridine N is acylated in the presence of two others.

###### Pyridones are good substrates for nucleophilic substitution

The starting materials for these nucleophilic substitutions (2- and 4-chloro- or methoxypyridines) are themselves made by nucleophilic substitution on pyridones. If you were asked to
propose how 2-methoxypyridine might be made, you would probably suggest, by analogy with
the corresponding benzene compound, alkylation of a phenol. Let us look at this in detail.

The starting material for this reaction is a 2-hydroxypyridine that can tautomerize to an
amide-like structure known as a pyridone by the shift of the acidic proton from oxygen to
nitrogen. In the phenol series there is no doubt about which structure will be stable as the
ketone is not aromatic; for the pyridine both structures are aromatic.

In fact, 2-hydroxypyridine prefers to exist as the ‘amide’ because that has the advantage of
a strong C=O bond and is still aromatic. There are two electrons in each of the C=C double
bonds and two also in the lone pair of electrons on the trigonal nitrogen atom of the amide.
Delocalization of the lone pair in typical amide style makes the point clearer.
Pyridones are easy to prepare (see Chapter 30) and can be alkylated on oxygen as predicted
by their structure. A more important reaction is the direct conversion to chloropyridines with
POCl3. The reaction starts by attack of the oxygen atom at phosphorus to create a leaving
group, followed by aromatic nucleophilic substitution. The overall effect is very similar to
acyl chloride formation from a carboxylic acid (Chapter 10).

- **Pyridines undergo nucleophilic substitution**

**Pyridines can undergo electrophilic substitution only if they are activated by electron-donating**
**substituents (see next section) but they readily undergo nucleophilic substitution without any**
**activation other than the ring nitrogen atom.**


###### Activated pyridines will do electrophilic aromatic substitution

Useful electrophilic substitutions occur only on pyridines having electron-donating substituents such as NH2 or OMe. These activate benzene rings too (Chapter 21) but here their help
is vital. They supply a non-bonding pair of electrons that raises the energy of the HOMO and
carries out the reaction. Simple amino- or methoxypyridines react reasonably well ortho and
_para to the activating group. These reactions happen in spite of the molecule being a pyridine,_
not because of it.

A practical example occurs in the manufacture of the analgesic fl upirtine where a doubly
activated pyridine having both MeO and NH2 groups is nitrated just as if it were a benzene
ring. The nitro group goes in ortho to the amino group and para to the methoxy group. The
activation is evidently enough to compensate for the molecule being almost entirely protonated under the conditions of the reaction.

###### Pyridine N-oxides are reactive towards both electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution

This is all very well if the molecule has such activating groups, but supposing it doesn’t? How
are we to nitrate pyridine itself? The answer involves an ingenious trick. We need to activate
the ring with an electron-rich substituent that can later be removed and we also need to stop
the nitrogen atom reacting with the electrophile. All of this can be done with a single atom!
Because the nitrogen atom is nucleophilic, pyridine can be oxidized to pyridine N-oxide
with reagents such as m-CPBA or just H2O2 in acetic acid. These N-oxides are stable dipolar
species with the electrons on oxygen delocalized round the pyridine ring, raising the HOMO
of the molecule. Reaction with electrophiles occurs at the 2- (ortho) and 4- (para) positions,
chiefl y at the 4-position to keep away from positively charged nitrogen.

Now the oxide must be removed and this is best done with trivalent phosphorus compounds such as (MeO)3P or PCl3. The phosphorus atom detaches the oxygen atom in a single
step to form the very stable P=O double bond. In this reaction the phosphorus atom is acting
as both a nucleophile and an electrophile, but mainly as an electrophile since PCl3 is more
reactive here than (MeO)3P.
The same activation that allowed simple electrophilic substitution—oxidation to the
_N-oxide—can also allow a useful nucleophilic substitution. The positive nitrogen atom encour-_
ages nucleophilic attack and the oxygen atom can be turned into a leaving group with PCl3.
Our example is nicotinic acid, whose biological importance we will discuss in Chapter 42.

The N-oxide reacts with PCl3 through oxygen and the chloride ion released in this reaction

The reagent PCl3 also converts the carboxylic acid to the acyl chloride, which is hydrolysed

Nucleophilic addition at an even more distant site is possible on reaction with acid anhydrides if there is an alkyl group in the 2-position. Acylation occurs on oxygen as in the last

Since pyridine is abundant and cheap and has an extremely rich chemistry, it is not surprising
that it has many applications. One of the simplest ways to brominate benzenes is not to bother
with the Lewis acid catalysts recommended in Chapter 21 but just to add liquid bromine to
the aromatic compound in the presence of a small amount of pyridine. Only about one mole
per cent is needed and even then the reaction has to be cooled to stop it getting out of hand.
As we have seen, pyridine attacks electrophiles through its nitrogen atom. This produces
the reactive species, the N-bromo-pyridinium ion, which is attacked by the benzene. Pyridine
is a better nucleophile than benzene and a better leaving group than bromide. This is another
example of nucleophilic catalysis.

Another way to use pyridine in brominations is to make a stable crystalline compound to
replace the dangerous liquid bromine. This compound, known by names such as pyridinium
tribromide, is simply a salt of pyridine with the anion Br3−. It can be used to brominate reactive
compounds such as alkenes (Chapter 19).

Both of these methods depend on the lack of reactivity of pyridine’s π system towards
electrophiles such as bromine. Notice that, in the fi rst case, both benzene and pyridine are
present together. The pyridine attacks bromine only through nitrogen (and reversibly at that)
and never through carbon.
Oxidation of alcohols is normally carried out with Cr(VI) reagents (Chapter 23) but these,
like the Jones’ reagent (Na2Cr2O7 in sulfuric acid), are usually acidic. Some pyridine complexes

of Cr(VI) compounds solve this problem by having the pyridinium ion (pKa 5) as the only
acid. The two most famous are PDC (pyridinium dichromate) and PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate). Pyridine forms a complex with CrO3 but this is liable to burst into fl ames.
Treatment with HCl gives PCC, which is much less dangerous. PCC is particularly useful in
the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes as over-oxidation is avoided in the only slightly
acidic conditions (Chapter 23).

###### Six-membered aromatic heterocycles can have oxygen in the ring

Although pyridine is overwhelmingly the most important of the six-membered aromatic heterocycles, there are oxygen heterocycles, pyrones, that resemble the pyridones. The pyrones
are aromatic, although α-pyrone is rather unstable.

###### Five-membered aromatic heterocycles are good at electrophilic substitution

Just about everything is the other way round with pyrrole. Electrophilic substitution is much
easier than it is with benzene—almost too easy in fact—while nucleophilic substitution is
more diffi cult. Pyrrole is not a base nor can it be converted to an N-oxide. We need to fi nd out
why this is. The big difference is that the nitrogen lone pair is delocalized round the ring. The
NMR spectrum suggests that all the positions in the ring are about equally electron-rich with
chemical shifts about 1 ppm smaller than those of benzene. The ring is fl at and the bond
lengths are very similar, although the bond opposite the nitrogen atom is a bit longer than the
others.

The delocalization of the lone pair can be drawn equally well to any ring atom because of
the fi ve-membered ring and we shall soon see the consequences of this. All the delocalization
pushes electrons from the nitrogen atom into the ring and we expect the ring to be electronrich at the expense of the nitrogen atom. The HOMO should go up in energy and the ring
become more nucleophilic.
An obvious consequence of this delocalization is the decreased basicity of the nitrogen
atom and the increased acidity of the NH group. In fact, the pKa of pyrrole acting as a base is
about –4, and protonation occurs at carbon below pH –4. By contrast, the NH proton (pKa
16.5) can be removed by much weaker bases than those that can remove protons on normal
secondary amines. The nucleophilic nature of the ring means that pyrrole is attacked readily
by electrophiles. Reaction with bromine requires no Lewis acid and leads to substitution (confi rming the aromaticity of pyrrole) at all four free positions. Contrast pyridine’s reactivity
with bromine (p. 731): it reacts just once, at nitrogen.

This is a fi ne reaction in its way, but we don’t usually want four bromine atoms in a molecule
so one problem with pyrrole is to control the reaction to give only monosubstitution. Another
problem is that strong acids cannot be used. Although protonation does not occur at nitrogen,
it does occur at carbon and the protonated pyrrole then adds another molecule like this.

Some reactions can be controlled to give good yields of monosubstituted products. One is
the Vilsmeier reaction, in which a combination of an N,N-dimethylamide and POCl3 is used
to make a carbon electrophile in the absence of strong acid or Lewis acid. It is a substitute for
the Friedel–Crafts acylation, and works with aromatic compounds at the more reactive end of
the scale (where pyrrole is).

The product from this fi rst step is an iminium cation that reacts with pyrrole to give a more

nitrogen and the iminium group. The work-up with aqueous Na2CO3 hydrolyses the imine
salt and removes any acid formed. This method is particularly useful because it works well
with Me2NCHO (DMF) to add a formyl (CHO) group. This is diffi cult to do with a conventional Friedel–Crafts reaction.

You may have noticed that the reaction occurred only at the 2-position on pyrrole. Although
all positions react with reagents like bromine, most reagents go for the 2- (or 5-) position and
attack the 3- (or 4-) position only if the 2- and 5-positions are blocked. A good example is the
Mannich reaction. In these two examples N-methylpyrrole reacts cleanly at the 2-position
while the other pyrrole with both 2- and 5-positions blocked by methyl groups reacts cleanly
at the 3-position. These reactions are used in the manufacture of the non-steroidal antiinfl ammatory compounds tolmetin and clopirac.

Now we need an explanation. The mechanisms for both 2- and 3-substitutions look good
and we will draw both, using a generalized E[+] as the electrophile. Both mechanisms can occur
very readily. Reaction in the 2-position is somewhat better than in the 3-position but the difference is small. Substitution is favoured at all positions. Calculations show that the HOMO of
pyrrole does indeed have a larger coeffi cient in the 2-position, and one way to explain this
result is to look at the structure of the intermediates. The intermediate from attack at the


-----

2-position has a linear conjugated system. In both intermediates the two double bonds are, of
course, conjugated with each other, but only in the fi rst intermediate are both double bonds
conjugated with N[+]. The second intermediate is ‘cross-conjugated’, while the fi rst has a more
stable linear conjugated system.

Since electrophilic substitution on pyrroles occurs so easily, it can be useful to block substitution with a removable substituent. This is usually done with an ester group. Hydrolysis of
the ester (this is particularly easy with t-butyl esters—see Chapter 23) releases the carboxylic
acid, which decarboxylates on heating. There is no doubt that the fi nal electrophilic substitution must occur at C2.

The decarboxylation is a general reaction of pyrroles: it’s a kind of reverse Friedel–Crafts

only if it occurs where there is a CO2H group.

###### Furan and thiophene are oxygen and sulfur analogues of pyrrole

The other simple fi ve-membered heterocycles are furan, with an oxygen atom instead of
nitrogen, and thiophene, with a sulfur atom. They also undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution very readily, although not so readily as pyrrole. Nitrogen is the most powerful electron
donor of the three, oxygen the next, and sulfur the least. Thiophene is very similar to benzene
in reactivity.
Thiophene is the least reactive of the three because the p orbital of the lone pair of electrons
on sulfur that conjugates with the ring is a 3p orbital rather than the 2p orbital of N or O, so
overlap with the 2p orbitals on carbon is less good. Both furan and thiophene undergo more
or less normal Friedel–Crafts reactions, although the less reactive anhydrides (here acetic
anhydride, Ac2O) are used instead of acid chlorides, and weaker Lewis acids than AlCl3 are
preferred.

###### Electrophilic addition may be preferred to substitution with furan

So far, thiophenes and furans look much the same as pyrrole but there are other reactions in
which they behave quite differently and we shall now concentrate on those. Furan is less aromatic than pyrrole, and if there is the prospect of forming stable bonds such as C–O single
bonds by addition, this may be preferred to substitution. A famous example is the reaction of
furan with bromine in methanol. In non-hydroxylic solvents, polybromination occurs as
expected, but in MeOH no bromine is added at all!

This product conceals an interesting molecule. At each side of the ring we have an acetal,
and if we were to hydrolyse the acetals, we would have ‘maleic dialdehyde’ (cis-butenedial)—a
molecule that is too unstable to be isolated. The furan derivative may be used in its place.

We can extend this idea of furan being the origin of 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds if we consider that furan is, in fact, an enol ether on both sides of the ring. If these enol ethers were

starting material containing a furan is furan-2-aldehyde or ‘furfural’, a by-product of breakfast cereal manufacture. Here it reacts in a typical Wittig process with a stabilized ylid.

The thiophene ring can also be opened up, but in a very different way. Reductive removal of
the sulfur atom with Raney nickel reduces not only the C–S bonds but also the double bonds
in the ring and the four carbons in the ring form a saturated alkyl chain. If the reduction follows two Friedel–Crafts reactions on thiophene the product is a 1,6-diketone instead of the
1,4-diketones from furan. Thiophene is well behaved in Friedel–Crafts acylations, and reaction occurs at the 2- and 5-positions unless these are blocked.

###### Lithiation of thiophenes and furans

A reaction that furans and thiophenes do particularly well and that fi ts well with these last
two reactions is metallation, particularly lithiation, of a C–H group next to the heteroatom.
Metallation of benzene rings (Chapter 24) is carried out by lithium–halogen (Br or I)
exchange—a method that works well for heterocycles too as we will see later with pyridine—
or by directed (ortho) lithiation of a C–H group next to an activating group such as OMe. With
thiophene and furan, the heteroatom in the ring provides the necessary activation.

Activation is by coordination of O or S to Li followed by proton removal by the butyl
group—the by-product is gaseous butane. These lithium compounds have a carbon–lithium
σ bond and are soluble in organic solvents. We shall represent them very simply, but in fact
they are typically dimers or more complex aggregates, with the coordination sphere of Li
completed by THF molecules.

This completes our exploration of chemistry special to thiophene and furan, and we now
return to all three heterocycles (pyrrole in particular) and look at nucleophilic substitution.

###### More reactions of fi ve-membered heterocycles

 Nucleophilic substitution requires an activating group

Nucleophilic substitution is a relatively rare reaction with pyrrole, thiophene, or furan and
requires an activating group such as nitro, carbonyl, or sulfonyl, just as it does with benzene
(Chapter 22). This intramolecular example is used to make the painkiller ketorolac.

The nucleophile is a stable enolate and the leaving group is a sulfi nate anion. An intermediate must be formed in which the negative charge is delocalized onto the carbonyl group on
the ring, just as you saw in the benzene ring examples in Chapter 22. Attack occurs at the
2-position because the leaving group is there and because the negative charge can be delocalized onto the ketone from that position.

###### Five-membered heterocycles act as dienes in Diels–Alder reactions

All of the reactions of pyrrole, furan, and thiophene we have discussed so far have been variations on reactions of benzene. But heterocycles also do reactions totally unlike those of
benzene and we are now going to explore two of them.


-----

The fi rst is a reaction you will meet in detail in Chapter 34. It is known as the Diels–Alder
reaction, and although it has a number of subtleties we will not discuss here, it has a simple
cyclic mechanism in which six electrons (three curly arrows) move around to form a new sixmembered ring.
Here is an example with the Boc derivative of pyrrole. The electron-defi cient Boc group
makes pyrrole less nucleophilic and promotes the Diels–Alder reaction with an alkynyl sulfone. Benzene, and even many other heterocycles, will not do this sort of reaction.

Aromaticity prevents thiophene taking part in Diels–Alder reactions, but oxidation to the
sulfone destroys the aromaticity because both lone pairs become involved in bonds to oxygen. The sulfone is unstable and reacts with itself but will also do Diels–Alder reactions. With
an alkyne, loss of SO2 gives a substituted benzene derivative.

Similar reactions occur with α-pyrones. These are also rather unstable and barely aromatic
and they react with alkynes by Diels–Alder reactions followed by reverse Diels–Alder reactions to give benzene derivatives with the loss of CO2.

###### Nitrogen anions can be easily made from pyrrole

Pyrrole is much more acidic than comparable saturated amines. The pKa of pyrrolidine is
about 35, but pyrrole has a pKa of 16.5, making it some 10[23] times more acidic! Pyrrole is
about as acidic as a typical alcohol so bases stronger than alkoxides will convert it to its
anion. We should not be too surprised at this as the corresponding hydrocarbon, cyclopentadiene, is also extremely acidic, with a pKa of 15. The reason is that the anions are aromatic
with six delocalized π electrons. The effect is much greater for cyclopentadiene because the
hydrocarbon is not aromatic and much less for pyrrole because it is already aromatic and has
less to gain.
In all of the reactions of pyrrole that we have so far seen, new groups have added to the
carbon atoms of the ring. The anion of pyrrole is useful because it reacts at nitrogen. The
nitrogen atom has two lone pairs of electrons in the anion: one is delocalized around the ring
but the other is localized in an sp[2] orbital on nitrogen. This high-energy pair is the new
HOMO and this is where the molecule reacts. N-acylated derivatives in general can be made
in this way. A commonly used base is sodium hydride (NaH) but weaker bases produce enough
anion for reaction to occur.

DMAP’s pKa of 9.7 is between
those of pyridine (5.5) and tertiary
alkyl amines (ca. 10) but is much
closer to the latter.


This is how the N-Boc pyrrole was made for use in the synthesis of epibatidine on p. 739. The
base used was the pyridine derivative DMAP, which you met earlier in the chapter
(p. 726). Its conjugate acid has a pKa of 9.7 and so produces small, equilibrating amounts of the
anion as well as acting as a nucleophilic catalyst. ‘Boc anhydride’ is used as the acylating
agent.

Anion formation is important in the next main section of this chapter, which is about what
happens when we insert more nitrogen atoms into the pyrrole ring.

###### Five-membered rings with two or more nitrogen atoms

 Imidazole

At the beginning of this chapter we imagined adding more nitrogen atoms to the pyrrole ring
and noticed then that there were two compounds with two nitrogen atoms: pyrazole and
imidazole.

Only one nitrogen atom in a fi ve-membered ring can contribute two electrons to the aromatic
sextet. The other replaces a CH group, has no hydrogen, and is like the nitrogen atom in pyridine. The black nitrogens are the pyrrole-like nitrogens; the green ones are pyridine-like. The
lone pairs on the black nitrogens are delocalized round the ring; those on the green nitrogens
are localized in sp[2] orbitals on nitrogen. We can expect these compounds to have properties
intermediate between those of pyrrole and pyridine. Imidazole is a stronger base than either
pyrrole or pyridine—the imidazolium ion has a pKa of almost exactly 7, meaning that it is 50%
protonated in neutral water. Imidazole is also more acidic than pyrrole, with a pKa of 14.5.

imidazolium ion imidazole

These curious results are a consequence of the 1,3 relationship between the two nitrogen
atoms. Both the (protonated) cation and the (deprotonated) anion share the charge equally
between the two nitrogen atoms—they are perfectly symmetrical and unusually stable. Another
way to look at the basicity of imidazole would be to say that both nitrogen atoms can act at once
on the proton being attacked. It has to be the pyridine-like nitrogen that actually captures the
proton but the pyrrole nitrogen can help by using its delocalized electrons like this:

**HN** **N** **H** **X** **HN** **NH** **+  X**

Nature makes use of this property by having imidazole groups attached to proteins in the form
of the amino acid histidine and using them as nucleophilic, basic, and acidic catalytic groups in
enzyme reactions (this will be discussed in Chapter 42). We use this property in the same way
when we add a silyl group to an alcohol. Imidazole is a popular catalyst for these reactions.

A weakly basic catalyst is needed here because we want to discriminate between the primary
and secondary alcohols in the diol. Imidazole is too weak a base to remove protons from an
alcohol (pKa ~ 16) but it can remove a proton after the OH group has attacked the silicon atom.

In fact, the imidazole is also a nucleophilic catalyst of this reaction, and the fi rst step is

The same idea leads to the use of carbonyl diimidazole (CDI) as a double electrophile when
we want to link two nucleophiles together by a carbonyl group. Phosgene (COCl2) has been
used for this but it is appallingly toxic (it was used in the First World War as a poison gas with
dreadful effects). CDI is safer and more controlled. In these reactions imidazole acts (twice) as
a leaving group.

The amino group probably attacks fi rst to displace one imidazole anion, which returns to
deprotonate the ammonium salt. The alcohol can then attack intramolecularly, displacing
the second imidazole anion, which deprotonates the OH group in its turn. The other product
is just two molecules of imidazole.

The relationship between the delocalized imidazole anion and imidazole itself is rather
like that between an enolate anion and an enol. It will come as no surprise therefore that, like
an enol, imidazole tautomerizes rapidly at room temperature in solution. For the parent
compound the two tautomers are the same, but with unsymmetrical imidazoles the tautomerism is more interesting. We will explore this question alongside electrophilic aromatic
substitution of imidazoles. Imidazoles with a substituent between the two nitrogen atoms
(position 2) can be nitrated with the usual reagents and the product consists of a mixture of
tautomers.

The initial nitration may occur at either of the remaining sites on the ring with the electrons coming from the pyrrole-like nitrogen atom. Tautomerism after nitration gives the mixture. Tautomerism is rapid and the tautomers cannot be separated.

The tautomerism can be stopped by alkylation at one of the nitrogen atoms. If this is done
in basic solution, the anion is an intermediate and the alkyl group adds to the nitrogen atom
next to the nitro group. Again, it does not matter from which tautomer the anion is derived—
there is only one anion delocalized over both nitrogen atoms and the nitro group. One reason
for the formation of this isomer is that it has the linear conjugated system between the
pyrrole-like nitrogen and the nitro group (see p. 734).

There are two triazoles, and each has one pyrrole-like nitrogen and two pyridine-like nitrogens. Both triazoles have the possibility of tautomerism (in 1,2,3-triazole the tautomers are
identical) and both give rise to a single anion.

The 1,2,4-triazole is more important because it is the basis of the best modern agricultural

that the anion is now easy to make.

A modern example of an agent used against human fungal infections is Pfi zer’s fl uconazole,

and the second is added to an epoxide made with the sulfur ylid chemistry you met in Chapter
27. Note that weak bases were used to catalyse both of these reactions. Triazole is acidic enough
for even NaHCO3 to produce a small amount of the anion.

two tautomers of a tetrazole about 5, essentially the same as that of a carboxylic acid. The anion is delocalized over all

four nitrogen atoms (as well as the one carbon atom), and four nitrogen atoms do the work of
two oxygen atoms.

Because tetrazoles have similar acidities to those of carboxylic acids, they have been used in
drugs as replacements for the CO2H unit when the carboxylic acid has unsatisfactory properties for human medicine. A simple example is the anti-arthritis drug indomethacin whose

###### Nitrogen atoms and explosions

Compounds with even two or three nitrogen atoms joined together, such as diazomethane (CH2N2) or azides (RN3), are
potentially explosive because they can suddenly give off stable gaseous nitrogen. Compounds with more nitrogen atoms,
such as tetrazoles, are likely to be more dangerous and few people have attempted to prepare pentazoles. The limit is
reached with diazotetrazole, with the amazing formula CN6! It is made by diazotization of 5-aminotetrazole, which fi rst
gives a diazonium salt.

###### Benzo-fused heterocycles

 Indoles are benzo-fused pyrroles


Indomethacin and its tetrazole analogue contain pyrrole rings with benzene rings fused to
the side. Such bicyclic heterocyclic structures are called indoles and are our next topic. Indole
itself has a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring sharing one double bond, or, if you prefer to look
at it this way, it is an aromatic system with 10 electrons—eight from four double bonds and
the lone pair from the nitrogen atom.

tryptophan


Indole is an important heterocyclic system because it is built into proteins in the form of the
amino acid tryptophan (Chapter 42) because it is the basis of important drugs such as indomethacin, and because it provides the skeleton of the indole alkaloids—biologically active
compounds from plants including strychnine and LSD (alkaloids are discussed in Chapter 42).
In many ways the chemistry of indole is that of a reactive pyrrole ring with a relatively
unreactive benzene ring standing on one side—electrophilic substitution almost always
occurs on the pyrrole ring, for example. But indole and pyrrole differ in one important respect.
In indole, electrophilic substitution is preferred in the 3-position with almost all reagents
whereas it occurs in the 2-position with pyrrole. Halogenation, nitration, sulfonation,
Friedel–Crafts acylation, and alkylation all occur cleanly at that position.

This is, of course, the reverse of what happens with pyrrole. Why should this be? A simple
explanation is that reaction at the 3-position simply involves the rather isolated enamine
system in the fi ve-membered ring and does not disturb the aromaticity of the benzene ring.
The positive charge in the intermediate is, of course, delocalized round the benzene ring, but
it gets its main stabilization from the nitrogen atom. It is not possible to get reaction in the
2-position without seriously disturbing the aromaticity of the benzene ring.

- **Electrophilic substitution on pyrrole and indole**

**Pyrrole reacts with electrophiles at all positions but prefers the 2- and 5-positions, while indole**
**much prefers the 3-position.**

A simple example of electrophilic substitution is the Vilsmeier formylation with DMF and
POCl3, showing that indole has similar reactivity, if different regioselectivity, to pyrrole. If the
3-position is blocked, reaction occurs at the 2-position and this at fi rst seems to suggest that it
is all right after all to take the electrons the ‘wrong way’ round the fi ve-membered ring. This
intramolecular Friedel–Crafts alkylation is an example.

To give this result, the reaction must have a symmetrical intermediate and the obvious
candidate arises from attack at the 3-position. The product is formed from the intermediate

CH2 group has an exactly equal chance of migrating.

It is now thought that most substitutions in the 2-position go by this migration route but
that some go by direct attack with disruption of the benzene ring. A good example of indole’s
3-position preference is the Mannich reaction, which works as well with indole as it does with
pyrrole or furan.

The electron-donating power of the indole and pyrrole nitrogens is never better demonstrated than in the use to which these Mannich bases (the products of the reaction) are put.
You may remember that normal Mannich bases can be converted to other compounds by
alkylation and elimination (see p. 621). No alkylation is needed here as the indole nitrogen
can even expel the Me2N group when NaCN is around as a base and nucleophile. The reaction
is slow and the yield not wonderful but it is amazing that it happens at all. The reaction is even
easier with pyrrole derivatives.

All of the fi ve-membered rings we have looked at have their benzo-derivatives but we will
concentrate on just one, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, both because it is an important compound
and because we have said little about simple 1,2,3-triazoles.

###### HOBt is an important reagent in peptide synthesis

1-Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) is a friend in need in the lives of biochemists. It is added to
many reactions where an activated ester of one amino acid is combined with the free amino
group of another (see Chapter 23 for some examples). It was fi rst made in the nineteenth
century by a remarkably simple reaction.
The structure of HOBt appears quite straightforward, except for the unstable N–O single
bond, but we can easily draw some other tautomers in which the proton on oxygen—the only
one in the heterocyclic ring—can be placed on some of the nitrogen atoms. These structures
are all aromatic, the second and third are nitrones, and the third structure looks less good
than the other two.

HOBt comes into play when amino acids are being coupled together in the laboratory. The
reaction is an amide formation, but in Chapter 23 we mentioned that amino-acyl chlorides
cannot be used to make polypeptides—they are too reactive and they lead to side reactions.
Instead, activated amino-esters (with good RO[−] leaving groups) are used, such as the phenyl
esters of Chapter 23. It is even more common to form the activated ester in the coupling reaction, using a coupling reagent, the most common being DCC, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.
DCC reacts with carboxylic acids like this:

The problem with attacking this ester directly with the amino group of the second amino
acid is that some racemization of the active ester is often found. A better method is to have
plenty of HOBt around. It intercepts the activated ester fi rst and the new intermediate does
not racemize, mostly because the reaction is highly accelerated by the addition of HOBt. The
second amino acid, protected on the carboxyl group, attacks the HOBt ester and gives the
dipeptide in a very fast reaction without racemization.

###### Putting more nitrogen atoms in a six-membered ring

At the beginning of the chapter we mentioned the three six-membered aromatic heterocycles
with two nitrogen atoms—pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine. In these compounds both
nitrogen atoms must be of the pyridine sort, with lone pair electrons not delocalized round
the ring.
We are going to look at these compounds briefl y here. Pyrimidine is more important than
either of the others because of its involvement in DNA and RNA—you will fi nd this in Chapter
42. All three compounds are very weak bases—hardly basic at all in fact. Pyridazine is slightly
more basic than the other two because the two adjacent lone pairs repel each other and make
the molecule more nucleophilic (the α effect again: see p. 513). The chemistry of these very
electron-defi cient rings mostly concerns nucleophilic attack and displacement of leaving
groups such as Cl by nucleophiles such as alcohols and amines. To introduce this subject we
need to take one heterocyclic synthesis at this point, although these are properly the subject
of the next chapter. The compound maleic hydrazide has been known for some time because
it is easily formed when hydrazine is acylated twice by maleic anhydride.

The compound actually prefers to exist as the second tautomer (in the green frame). Reaction
with POCl3 in the way we have seen for pyridine gives the undoubtedly aromatic pyridazine
dichloride. Now we come to the point. Each of these chlorides can be displaced in turn with
an oxygen or nitrogen nucleophile. Only one chloride is displaced in the fi rst reaction, if that
is required, and then the second can be displaced with a different nucleophile.

How is this possible? The mechanism of the reactions is addition to the pyridazine ring
followed by loss of the leaving group. When the second nucleophile attacks it is forced to
attack a less electrophilic ring. An electron-withdrawing group (Cl) has been replaced by a
strongly electron-donating group (NH2) so the rate-determining step, the addition of the
nucleophile, is slower.

The same principle applies to other easily made symmetrical dichloro derivatives of these
rings and their benzo analogues. The nitrogen atoms can be related 1,2, 1,3, or 1,4, as in these
examples. The fi rst two are used to link the quinine-derived ligands required for the Sharpless
asymmetric dihydroxylation, which will be described in Chapter 41.

###### Fusing rings to pyridines: quinolines and isoquinolines

A benzene ring can be fused on to the pyridine ring in two ways, giving the important
heterocycles quinoline, with the nitrogen atom next to the benzene ring, and isoquinoline, with the nitrogen atom in the other possible position. Quinoline forms part of quinine
(structure at the head of this chapter) and isoquinoline forms the central skeleton of the
isoquinoline alkaloids, which we will discuss in Chapter 42. In this chapter we need not
say much about quinoline because it behaves rather as you would expect—its chemistry is
a mixture of that of benzene and pyridine. Electrophilic substitution favours the benzene
ring and nucleophilic substitution favours the pyridine ring. So nitration of quinoline
gives two products—the 5-nitroquinolines and the 8-nitroquinolines—in about equal
quantities (although you will realize that the reaction really occurs on protonated
quinoline).

This is obviously rather unsatisfactory but nitration is actually one of the better behaved
reactions. Chlorination gives ten products (at least!), of which no fewer than fi ve are chlorinated quinolines of various structures. The nitration of isoquinoline is rather better behaved,
giving 72% of one isomer (5-nitroisoquinoline) at 0 °C.

To get reaction on the pyridine ring, the _N-oxide can be used—as with pyridine itself._
A good example is acridine, with two benzene rings, which gives four nitration products, all
on the benzene rings. Its N-oxide, on the other hand, gives just one product in good yield—
nitration takes place at the only remaining position on the pyridine ring.

In general, these reactions are not of much use and most substituents are put into quinolines during ring synthesis from simple precursors, as we will explain in the next chapter.
There are a couple of quinoline reactions that are unusual and interesting. Vigorous oxidation
goes for the more electron-rich ring, the benzene ring, and destroys it leaving pyridine rings
with carbonyl groups in the 2- and 3-positions.

A particularly interesting nucleophilic substitution occurs when quinoline _N-oxide is_
treated with acylating agents in the presence of nucleophiles. These two examples show that
nucleophilic substitution occurs in the 2-position and you may compare these reactions with
those of pyridine N-oxide. The mechanism is similar.

In considering quinolines and indoles with their fused rings we kept the benzene and
hetero cyclic rings separate. Yet there is a way in which they can be combined more intimately,
and that is to have a nitrogen atom at a ring junction.

###### A nitrogen atom can be at a ring junction

It has to be a pyrrole-type nitrogen as it must have three σ bonds, so the lone pair must be in
a p orbital. This means that one of the rings must be fi ve-membered and the simplest member
of this interesting class is called indolizine—it has pyridine and pyrrole rings fused together
along a C–N bond. If you examine this structure you will see that there is defi nitely a pyrrole
ring but that the pyridine ring is not all there. Of course, the lone pair and the π electrons are
all delocalized but this system, unlike indole and quinoline, is much better regarded as a tenelectron outer ring than as two six-electron rings joined together. Indolizidine reacts with
electrophiles on the fi ve-membered rings by substitution reactions as expected.

###### Fused rings with more than one nitrogen

It is easily possible to continue to insert nitrogen atoms into fused ring systems and some
important compounds belong to these groups. The purines are part of DNA and RNA, one
example is adenine and another is guanine in the box below, but simple purines play an
important part in our lives. Coffee and tea owe their stimulant properties to caffeine, a simple trimethyl purine derivative. It has an imidazole ring fused to a pyrimidine ring and is
aromatic in spite of the two carbonyl groups.

Other fused heterocycles have very attractive fl avour and odour properties. Pyrazines, in
general, are important in many strong food fl avours: a fused pyrazine with a ring junction
nitrogen atom is one of the most important components in the smell of roast meat. You can
read about the simple pyrazine that provides green peppers with their fl avour in the box on
the next page.
Finally, the compounds in the margin form a medicinally important group of molecules,
which includes antitumour compounds for humans and anthelmintics (compounds that get
rid of parasitic worms) for animals. They are derived from a 6/5 fused aromatic ring system
that resembles the ten-electron system of the indolizine ring system but has three nitrogen
atoms.
All this multiple heteroatom insertion is possible only with nitrogen and we need to look
briefl y at what happens when we combine nitrogen with oxygen or in heterocycles.

###### Aromatic heterocycles can have many nitrogens but only one sulfur or oxygen in any ring

A neutral oxygen or sulfur atom can have only two bonds and so it can never be like the nitrogen atom in pyridine—it can only be like the nitrogen atom in pyrrole. We can put as many
pyridine-like nitrogens as we like in an aromatic ring, but never more than one pyrrole-like
nitrogen. Similarly, we can put only one oxygen or sulfur atom in an aromatic ring. The simplest examples are oxazoles and thiazoles, and their less stable isomers isoxazoles and
isothiazoles.
The instability of the ‘iso-’ compounds comes from the weak O–N or S–N bond. These
bonds can be cleaved by reducing agents, which then usually reduce the remaining functional groups further. The fi rst product from reduction of the N–O bond is an unstable
imino-enol. The enol tautomerizes to the ketone and the imine may be reduced further to
the amine.
Such heterocycles with even more nitrogen atoms exist but are relatively unimportant and
we shall mention just one, the 1,2,5-thiadiazole, because it is part of a drug, timolol.

###### There are thousands more heterocycles out there

But we’re not going to discuss them and we hope you’re grateful. In fact, it’s about time to
stop, and we shall leave you with a hint of the complexity that is possible. If pyrrole is combined with benzaldehyde a good yield of a highly coloured crystalline compound is formed: a
porphyrin. Now, what about this ring system—is it aromatic? It’s certainly highly delocalized
and your answer to the question clearly depends on whether you include the nitrogen electrons or not. In fact, if you ignore the pyrrole-like nitrogen atoms but include the pyridinelike nitrogens and weave round the periphery, you have nine double bonds and hence
18 electrons—a 4n + 2 number. Most people agree that these compounds are aromatic.
Some heterocycles are simple, some very complex, but we cannot live without them. We
shall end this chapter with a wonderful story of heterocyclic chemistry at work. Folic acid is
much in the news today as a vitamin that is particularly important for pregnant women, but
is involved in the metabolism of all living things. Folic acid is built up in nature from three
pieces: a heterocyclic starting material (red), p-aminobenzoic acid (black), and the amino acid
glutamic acid (green). Here you see the precursor, dihydrofolic acid.

Although folic acid is vital for human health, we don’t have the enzymes to make it: it’s a
vitamin, which means we must take it in our diet or we die. Bacteria, on the other hand, do
make folic acid. This is very useful because it means that if we inhibit the enzymes of folic acid
synthesis we can kill bacteria but we cannot possibly harm ourselves as we don’t have those
enzymes. The sulfa drugs, such as sulfamethoxypyridazine or sulfamethoxazole, imitate
_p-aminobenzoic acid and inhibit the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase. Each has a new_
hetero cyclic system added to the sulfonamide part of the drug.

The next step in folic acid synthesis is the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate.
This can be done by both humans and bacteria, and although it looks like a rather trivial
reaction (see black portion of molecules), it can only be done by the very important enzyme

Although both bacteria and humans have this enzyme, the bacterial version is different
enough for us to attack it with specifi c drugs. An example is trimethoprim—yet another
hetero cyclic compound with a pyrimidine core (black on diagram). These two types of drugs
that attack the folic acid metabolism of bacteria are often used together.
We will see in the next chapter how to make these heterocyclic systems and, in Chapter 42,
other examples of how important they are in living things.

###### Which heterocyclic structures should you learn?

This is, of course, nearly a matter of personal choice. Every chemist really must know the
names of the simplest heterocycles and we give those below along with a menu of suggestions.

In this chapter you will revisit the heterocyclic systems you have just met and fi nd out how to
make them. You’ll also meet some new heterocyclic systems and fi nd out how to make those.
With so many heterocycles to consider, you’d be forgiven for feeling rather daunted by this
prospect, but do not be alarmed. Making heterocycles is easy—that’s precisely why there are
so many of them. Just refl ect. . .

 - Making C–O, C–N, and C–S bonds is easy.

 - Intramolecular reactions are preferred to intermolecular reactions.

 - Forming fi ve- and six-membered rings is easy.

 - We are talking about aromatic, that is, very stable molecules.

If we are to use these bullet points to our advantage we must think strategy before we start.
When we were making benzene compounds we usually started with a preformed simple benzene derivative—toluene, phenol, aniline—and added side chains by electrophilic substitution. In this chapter our strategy will usually be to build the heterocyclic ring with most of its
substituents already in place and add just a few others, perhaps by electrophilic substitution,
but mostly by nucleophilic substitution.
We will usually make the rings by cyclization reactions with the heteroatom (O, N, S) as a
nucleophile and a suitably functionalized carbon atom as the electrophile. This electrophile

will almost always be a carbonyl compound of some sort and this chapter will help you revise
your carbonyl chemistry from Chapters 10, 11, 20, 25, and 26 as well as the approach to synthesis described in Chapter 28.

###### Thermodynamics is on our side

Some of the syntheses we will meet will be quite surprisingly simple! It sometimes seems that
we can just mix a few things together with about the right number of atoms and let thermodynamics do the rest. A commercial synthesis of pyridines combines acetaldehyde and
ammonia under pressure to give a simple pyridine.
The yield is only about 50%, but what does that matter in such a simple process? By counting atoms we can guess that four molecules of aldehyde and one of ammonia react, but exactly
how is a triumph of thermodynamics over mechanism. Much more complex molecules can
sometimes be made very easily too. Take allopurinol, for example, which you met in the last
chapter. It is not too diffi cult to work out where the atoms go—the hydrazine obviously gives
rise to the pair of adjacent nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring and the ester group must be the
origin of the carbonyl group (the colours and numbers illustrate this)—but would you have
planned this synthesis?

We will see that this sort of ‘witch’s brew’ approach to heterocyclic synthesis is restricted to
a few basic ring systems and that, in general, careful planning is just as important here as
elsewhere. The difference is that the synthesis of aromatic heterocycles is very forgiving—it
often ‘goes right’ instead of going wrong. We’ll now look seriously at planning the synthesis
of aromatic heterocycles.

###### Disconnect the carbon–heteroatom bonds fi rst

The simplest synthesis for a heterocycle emerges when we remove the heteroatom and see
what electrophile we need. We shall use pyrroles as examples. The nitrogen forms an enamine
on each side of the ring and we know that enamines are made from carbonyl compounds and
amines.

What we need is an amine— ammonia in this case—and a diketone. If the two carbonyl
groups have a 1,4 relationship we will get a pyrrole out of this reaction. So hexane-2,5-dione
reacts with ammonia to give a high yield of 2,5-dimethyl pyrrole. Making furans is even
easier because the heteroatom (oxygen) is already there. All we have to do is to dehydrate the
1,4-diketone instead of making enamines from it. Heating with acid is enough.

For thiophenes we could in theory use H2S or some other sulfur nucleophile but, in practice,
an electrophilic reagent is usually used to convert the two C=O bonds to C=S bonds.
Thioketones are much less stable than ketones and cyclization is swift. Reagents such as P2S5
or Lawesson’s reagent are the usual choice here.

- **Making fi ve-membered heterocycles**

**Cyclization of 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds with nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen nucleophiles gives the**
**fi ve-membered aromatic heterocycles pyrrole, thiophene, and furan.**


It seems a logical extension to use a 1,5-diketone to make substituted pyridines but there
is a slight problem here as we will introduce only two of the required three double bonds
when the two enamines are formed. To get the pyridine by enamine formation we should
need a double bond somewhere in the chain between the two carbonyl groups. But here
another diffi culty arises—it will have to be a cis (Z) double bond or cyclization would be
impossible.

On the whole it is easier to use the saturated 1,5-diketone and oxidize the product to the
pyridine. As we are going from a non-aromatic to an aromatic compound, oxidation is easy
and we can replace the question mark above with almost any simple oxidizing agent, as we
shall soon see.



- **Making six-membered heterocycles**

**Cyclization of 1,5-dicarbonyl compounds with nitrogen nucleophiles leads to the six-membered**
**aromatic heterocycle pyridine.**


###### Heterocycles with two nitrogen atoms come from the same strategy

Reacting a 1,4-diketone with hydrazine (NH2NH2) makes a double enamine again and this is
only an oxidation step away from a pyridazine. This is also a good synthesis.

If we use a 1,3-diketone instead we will get a fi ve-membered heterocycle and the imine and
enamine formed are enough to give aromaticity without any need for oxidation. The product
is a pyrazole. The two heteroatoms do not, of course, need to be joined together for this strategy to work. If an amidine is combined with the same 1,3-diketone we get a six-membered
heterocycle. As the nucleophile contains one double bond already, an aromatic pyrimidine is
formed directly.

Since diketones and other dicarbonyl compounds are easily made by enolate chemistry
(Chapters 25, 26, and 28) this strategy has been very popular and we will look at some detailed
examples before moving on to more specialized reactions for the different classes of aromatic
heterocycles.

###### Pyrroles, thiophenes, and furans from 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds

We need to make the point that pyrrole synthesis can be done with primary amines as well as
with ammonia and a good example is the pyrrole needed for clopirac, a drug we discussed in
Chapter 29. The synthesis is very easy.

**NH2**


**Cl**

For an example of furan synthesis we choose menthofuran, which contributes to the fl avour
of mint. It has a second ring, but that is no problem if we simply disconnect the enol ethers as
we have been doing so far.

The starting material is again a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound but as there was no substituent at
C1 of the furan, that atom is an aldehyde rather than a ketone. This might lead to problems in
the synthesis so a few changes (using the notation you met in Chapter 28) are made to the
intermediate before further disconnection.

Notice in particular that we have ‘oxidized’ the aldehyde to an ester to make it more stable—

does indeed go very well with the α-iodo-ester.

Cyclization with acid now causes a lot to happen. The 1,4-dicarbonyl compound cyclizes to
a lactone, not to a furan, and the redundant ester group is lost by hydrolysis and decarboxylation. Notice that the double bond moves into conjugation with the lactone carbonyl group.
Finally, the reduction gives the furan. No special precautions are necessary—as soon as the
ester is partly reduced, it loses water to give the furan whose aromaticity prevents further
reduction even with LiAlH4.

**fi ve-membered aromatic heterocycles pyrrole, thiophene, and furan.**


Now we need to take these ideas further and discuss an important pyrrole synthesis that
follows this strategy but includes a cunning twist. It all starts with the porphyrin found in
blood. In Chapter 29 we gave the structure of porphyrin and showed that it contains four
pyrrole rings joined in a macrocycle. We are going to look at one of those pyrroles.
Porphyrins can be made by joining together the various pyrroles in the right order and what
is needed for this one (and also, in fact, for another—the one in the north-east corner of the
porphyrin) is a pyrrole with the correct substituents in positions 3 and 4, a methyl group in position 5, and a hydrogen atom at position 2. Position 2 must be free. Here is the molecule
drawn somewhat more conveniently, together with the disconnection we have been using so far.

No doubt such a synthesis could be carried out but it is worth looking for alternatives for a
number of reasons. We would prefer not to make a pyrrole with a free position at C2 as that
would be very reactive and we know from Chapter 29 that we can reversibly block such a position with a t-butyl ester group. This gives us a very diffi cult starting material with four different carbonyl groups.

We have made a problem for ourselves by having two carbonyl groups next to each other.
Could we escape from that by replacing one of them with an amine? We should then have an
ester of an α amino acid, a much more attractive starting material, and this corresponds to
disconnecting just one of the C–N bonds.

At fi rst we seem to have made no progress but just see what happens when we move the
double bond round the ring into conjugation with the ketone. After all, it doesn’t matter
where the double bond starts out—we will always get the aromatic product.

- Conjugate additions with
1,3-dicarbonyl compounds were
discussed in Chapter 26. If you
have read Chapter 28 then you
should be aware that such
reactions are an excellent way
of making 1,5-difunctionalized
compounds.


Each of our two much simpler starting materials needs to be made. The keto-ester is a
1,5-dicarbonyl compound so it can be made by a conjugate addition of an enolate, a process
greatly assisted by the addition of a second ester group.

The other compound is an amino-keto-ester and will certainly react with itself if we try to
prepare it as a pure compound. The answer is to release it directly into the reaction mixture
and this can be done by nitrosation and reduction (Chapter 20) of another stable enolate.

###### Names for heterocyclic syntheses

Standard heterocyclic syntheses tend to have a name associated with them and it is simply not worthwhile learning these
names. Few chemists use any but the most famous of them: we will mention the Knorr pyrrole synthesis, the Hantzsch
pyridine synthesis, and the Fischer and Reissert indole syntheses. We did not mention that the synthesis of furans from
1,4-dicarbonyl compounds is known as the Feist–Benary synthesis, and there are many more like this. If you are really
interested in these other names we suggest you consult a specialist book on heterocyclic chemistry.


###### How to make pyridines: the Hantzsch pyridine synthesis

The idea of coupling two keto-esters together with a nitrogen atom also works for pyridines except that an extra carbon atom is needed. This is provided as an aldehyde and
another important difference is that the nitrogen atom is added as a nucleophile rather
than an electrophile. These are features of the **Hantzsch pyridine synthesis. This is a**
four-component reaction from simple starting materials.

You are hardly likely to understand the rationale behind this reaction from that diagram so
let’s explore the details. The product of the reaction is actually the dihydropyridine, which
has to be oxidized to the pyridine by a reagent such as HNO3, Ce(IV), or a quinone.
The reaction is very simply carried out by mixing the components in the right proportions
in ethanol. The presence of water does not spoil the reaction and the ammonia, or some added
amine, ensures the slightly alkaline pH necessary. Any aldehyde can be used, even formaldehyde, and yields of the crystalline dihydropyridine are usually very good.


**Arthur Hantzsch, 1857–1935,**
the ‘fi ery stereochemist’ of
Leipzig, was most famous for
the work he did with Werner at
the ETH in Zurich where in 1890
he suggested that oximes could
exist in cis and trans forms.

This reaction is an impressive piece of molecular recognition by small molecules and writing a detailed mechanism is a bold venture. We can see that certain events have to happen,
but which order they happen in is a matter of conjecture. The ammonia has to attack the
ketone groups, but it would prefer to attack the more electrophilic aldehyde so this is probably
not the fi rst step. The enol or enolate of the keto-ester has to attack the aldehyde (twice!) so let
us start there.

This adduct is in equilibrium with the stable enolate from the keto-ester and elimination
now gives an unsaturated carbonyl compound. Such chemistry is associated with the aldol
reactions we discussed in Chapter 26. The new enone has two carbonyl groups at one end
of the double bond and is therefore a very good Michael acceptor (Chapter 25). A second
molecule of enolate does a conjugate addition to complete the carbon skeleton of the molecule. Now the ammonia attacks either of the ketones and cyclizes on to the other. As
ketones are more electrophilic than esters it is to be expected that ammonia will prefer to
react there.

The necessary oxidation is easy both because the product is aromatic and because the nitrogen atom can help to expel the hydrogen atom and its pair of electrons from the 4-position. If
we use a quinone as oxidizing agent, both compounds become aromatic in the same step.

To recap this mechanism, the essentials are:

 - addition of ammonia to one ketone

 - cyclization of the imine or enamine on to the other ketone

although several of the steps could happen in a different order.
The Hantzsch pyridine synthesis is an old discovery (1882) which sprang into prominence
in the 1980s with the discovery that the dihydropyridine intermediates prepared from
aromatic aldehydes are calcium channel-blocking agents and therefore valuable drugs for
heart disease with useful effects on angina and hypertension.

So far, so good. But it also became clear that the best drugs were unsymmetrical—some in a

these compounds.

Clearly, a modifi cation is needed in which half of the molecule is assembled fi rst. The solution lies in early work by Robinson, who made the very fi rst enamines from keto-esters and

###### Other syntheses of pyridines

The Hantzsch synthesis produces a reduced pyridine but there are many syntheses that go
directly to pyridines. One of the simplest is to use hydroxylamine (NH2OH) instead of ammonia as the nucleophile. Reaction with a 1,5-diketone gives a dihydropyridine but then water
is lost and no oxidation is needed.

The example below shows how these 1,5-diketones may be quickly made by the Mannich
(Chapter 26) and Michael (Chapter 25) reactions. Our pyridine has a phenyl substituent and
a fused saturated ring. First we must disconnect to the 1,5-diketone.

The synthesis is extraordinarily easy. The stable Mannich base is simply heated with the

Another direct route leads, as we shall now demonstrate, to pyridones. These useful compounds are the basis for nucleophilic substitutions on the ring (Chapter 29). We choose an
example that puts a nitrile in the 3-position. This is signifi cant because the role of nicotinamide in living things (Chapter 42) makes such products interesting to make. Aldol disconnection of a 3-cyano pyridone starts us on the right path. If we now disconnect the C–N bond
forming the enamine on the other side of the ring we will expose the true starting materials.
This approach is unusual in that the nitrogen atom that is to be the pyridine nitrogen is not
added as ammonia but is already present in a molecule of cyanoacetamide.

The keto-aldehyde can be made by a simple Claisen ester condensation (Chapter 26) using

In planning the synthesis of a pyrrole or a pyridine from a dicarbonyl compound, considerable variation in oxidation state is possible. The oxidation state is chosen to make further
disconnection of the carbon skeleton as easy as possible. We can now see how these same
principles can be applied to pyrazoles and pyridazines.

###### Pyrazoles and pyridazines from hydrazine and dicarbonyl compounds

Disconnection of pyridazines reveals a molecule of hydrazine and a 1,4-diketone with the
proviso that, just as with pyridines, the product will be a dihydropyrazine and oxidation will
be needed to give the aromatic compound. As with pyridines, we prefer to avoid the cis double
bond problem.

###### Chemistry hits the headlines—Viagra

In 1998 chemistry suddenly appeared in the media in an exceptional way. Normally not a
favourite of TV or the newspapers, chemistry produced a story with all the right ingredients—
sex, romance, human ingenuity—and all because of a pyrazole. In the search for a heart drug,
Pfi zer uncovered a compound that allowed impotent men to have active sex lives. They called
it Viagra. The molecule contains a sulfonamide and a benzene ring as well as the part that
interests us most—a bicyclic aromatic heterocyclic system of a pyrazole fused to a pyrimidine.
We shall discuss in detail how Pfi zer made this part of the molecule and just sketch in the rest.
The sulfonamide can be made from the sulfonic acid that can be added to the benzene ring by
electrophilic aromatic sulfonation (Chapter 21).

Following the methods we have established so far in this chapter, we can remove the hydrazine portion to reveal a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound. In fact, this is a tricarbonyl compound, a
diketo-ester, because of the ester already present and it contains 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-dicarbonyl
relationships. The simplest synthesis is by a Claisen ester condensation and we choose the
disconnection so that the electrophile is a reactive (oxalate) diester that cannot enolize. The
only control needed will then be in the enolization of the ketone.

The Claisen ester condensation gives the right product just by treatment with base. The
reasons for this are discussed in Chapter 26. We had then planned to treat the keto-diester
with methylhydrazine but there is a doubt about the regioselectivity of this reaction—the
ketones are more electrophilic than the ester all right, but which ketone will be attacked by
which nitrogen atom?

###### Pyrimidines can be made from 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds and amidines

In Chapter 29 we met some compounds that interfere in folic acid metabolism and are used as
antibacterial agents. One of them was trimethoprim and it contains a pyrimidine ring (black
on the diagram). We are going to look at its synthesis briefl y because the strategy used is the
opposite of that used with the pyrimidine ring in Viagra. Here we disconnect a molecule of
guanidine from a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound.

The 1,3-dicarbonyl compound is a combination of an aldehyde and an amide but is very

The alkylation works fi ne but it turns out to be better to add the aldehyde as an electrophile
(cf. the pyridone synthesis on p. 766) rather than try to reduce an ester to an aldehyde. The
other ester is already at the right oxidation level.

###### Unsymmetrical nucleophiles lead to selectivity questions

The synthesis of thiazoles is particularly interesting because of a regioselectivity problem. If
we try out the two strategies we have just used for pyrimidines, the fi rst requires the reaction
of a carboxylic acid derivative with a most peculiar enamine that is also a thioenol. This does
not look like a stable compound.

The alternative is to disconnect the C–N and C–S bonds on the other side of the heteroatoms. Here we must be careful what we are about or we will get the oxidation state wrong. We
shall do it step by step to make sure. We can rehydrate the double bond in two ways. We can
fi rst try putting the OH group next to nitrogen.

Or we can rehydrate it the other way round, putting the OH group next to the sulfur atom,
and disconnect in the same way. In both cases we require an electrophilic carbon atom at the
alcohol oxidation level and one at the aldehyde or ketone oxidation level. In other words we
need an α-haloketone.

The nucleophile is the same in both cases and it is an odd-looking molecule. That is, until
we realize that it is just a tautomer of a thioamide. Far from being odd, thioamides are among
the few stable thiocarbonyl derivatives and can be easily made from ordinary amides with
P2S5 or Lawesson’s reagent.

So the only remaining question is: when thioamides combine with α-haloketones, which
nucleophilic atom (N or S) attacks the ketone, and which atom (N or S) attacks the alkyl halide? Carbonyl groups are ‘hard’ electrophiles—their reactions are mainly under charge control and so they react best with basic nucleophiles (Chapter 10). Alkyl halides are ‘soft’
electrophiles—their reactions are mainly under frontier orbital control and they react best
with large uncharged nucleophiles from the lower rows of the periodic table. The ketone
reacts with nitrogen and the alkyl halide with sulfur.

- We will cover cycloadditions
in detail in Chapter 34—in fact
you have met an example already
in the last chapter: the Diels–
Alder reaction (p. 739) is also a
cycloaddition. The cycloadditions
here involve a 1,3-dipole and
form a fi ve-membered ring, by a
cyclic mechanism involving six
electrons.


The synthesis involves heating these two compounds together and the correct thiazole
forms easily with the double bonds fi nding their right positions in the product—the only
positions for a stable aromatic heterocycle.

###### Isoxazoles are made from hydroxylamine or by cycloaddition

The two main routes for the synthesis of isoxazoles are (a) the attack of hydroxylamine
(NH2OH) on diketones and (b) a reaction of nitrile oxides called a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.
They thus form a link between the strategy we have been discussing (cyclization of a nucleophile with two heteroatoms and a compound with two electrophilic carbon atoms) and the
next strategy—cycloaddition reactions.

Simple symmetrical isoxazoles are easily made by the hydroxylamine route. If R[1 ]= R[3], we
have a symmetrical and easily prepared 1,3-diketone as starting material. The central R[2]
group can be inserted by alkylation of the stable enolate of the diketone (Chapter 25).


-----

When R[1] ≠ R[3], we have an unsymmetrical dicarbonyl compound and we must be sure that
we know which way round the reaction will proceed. The more nucleophilic end of NH2OH
will attack the more electrophilic carbonyl group. It seems obvious that the more nucleophilic
end of NH2OH will be the nitrogen atom but that depends on the pH of the solution. Normally,
hydroxylamine is supplied as the crystalline hydrochloride salt and a base of some kind added
to give the nucleophile. The relevant pKas are shown in the margin. Bases such as pyridine or
sodium acetate produce some of the reactive neutral NH2OH in the presence of the less reactive cation, but bases such as NaOEt produce the anion. Reactions of keto-aldehydes with
acetate-buffered hydroxylamine usually give the isoxazole from nitrogen attack on the aldehyde as expected.

Modifi cation of the electrophile may also be successful. Reaction of hydroxylamine with

keto group next to the ester.

The alternative approach to isoxazoles relies on the reaction of nitrile oxides with alkynes.
We shall see in Chapter 34 that there are two good routes to these reactive compounds, the
γ-elimination of chlorooximes or the dehydration of nitroalkanes.

A few nitrile oxides are stable enough to be isolated (those with electron-withdrawing or
highly conjugating substituents, for example) but most are prepared in the presence of the
alkyne by one of these methods because otherwise they dimerize rapidly. Both methods of
forming nitrile oxides are compatible with their rapid reactions with alkynes. With aryl
alkynes the reaction is usually clean and regioselective.

The reaction forms the fi ve-membered ring in a single step: it is a cycloaddition, in which
the alkyne is using its HOMO to attack the LUMO of the nitrile oxide (see Chapter 34 for an
explanation). If the alkyne has an electron-withdrawing group, mixtures of isomers are usually formed as the HOMO of the nitrile oxide also attacks the LUMO of the alkyne.
Intramolecular reactions are usually clean regardless of the preferred electronic orientation if


-----

the tether is too short to allow any cyclization except one. In this example, even the more
favourable orientation looks very bad because of the linear nature of the reacting species, but
only one isomer is formed.

###### Tetrazoles and triazoles are also made by cycloadditions

Disconnection of tetrazoles with a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition in mind is easy to see once we
realize that a nitrile (RCN) is going to be one of the components. It can be done in two ways:
disconnection of the neutral compound would require the dangerous hydrazoic acid (HN3) as
the dipole but the anion disconnects directly to azide ion.

- You saw in Chapter 29 that
tetrazoles are about as acidic as
carboxylic acids.


Unpromising though this reaction may look, it actually works well if an ammonium chloride-buffered mixture of sodium azide and the nitrile is heated in DMF. The reagent is really
ammonium azide and the reaction occurs faster with electron-withdrawing substituents in R.
In the reaction mixture, the anion of the tetrazole is formed but neutralization with acid gives
the free tetrazole.

As nitriles are generally readily available this is the main route to simple tetrazoles. More
complicated ones are made by alkylation of the product of a cycloaddition. The tetrazole substitute for indomethacin that we mentioned in Chapter 29 is made by this approach. First, the
nitrile is prepared from the indole. The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition works well by the azide
route we have just discussed, even though this nitrile will form an ‘enol’ rather easily. Finally,
the indole nitrogen atom must be acylated. The tetrazole is more acidic so it is necessary to
form a dianion to get reaction at the right place. The usual rule is followed (see Chapter 23)—
the second anion formed is less stable and so it reacts fi rst.

The synthesis of the anti-infl ammatory drug broperamole illustrates modifi cation of a tetrazole using its anion. The tetrazole is again constructed from the nitrile—it’s an aromatic
nitrile with an electron-withdrawing substituent so this will be a good reaction.
Conjugate addition to acrylic acid (Chapter 22) occurs to give the other tautomer to the one
we have drawn. The anion intermediate is, of course, delocalized and can react at any of the
nitrogen atoms. Amide formation completes the synthesis of broperamole.

One of the best reactions of all is the related cycloaddition of a substituted azide to an

However, a simple addition to the reaction mixture improves the situation hugely: a catalytic amount of Cu(I), often made in situ by adding CuSO4 and a mild reducing agent, makes
the reaction much faster and gives the 1,4-disubstituted triazole selectively. The work of
Sharpless has turned this reaction into not only a very powerful way of making triazoles, but
also a very simple way of linking two otherwise relatively unreactive molecules together—the
reaction even works in water.

###### The Fischer indole synthesis

You are about to see one of the great inventions of organic chemistry. It is a remarkable reaction, amazing in its mechanism, and it was discovered in 1883 by one of the greatest organic
chemists of all, Emil Fischer. Fischer had earlier discovered phenylhydrazine (PhNHNH2)
and, in its simplest form, the Fischer indole synthesis occurs when phenylhydrazine is heated
in acidic solution with an aldehyde or ketone.



- It may look as though the
more nucleophilic end of the
azide has attacked the wrong
end of the alkyne but you will
see in Chapter 34 that (1) it is
very diffi cult to predict which is
the more nucleophilic end of a
1,3-dipole and (2) it may be
either HOMO (dipole) and LUMO
(alkyne), or LUMO (dipole) and
HOMO (alkyne) that dominate
the reaction.

**Emil Fischer (1852–1919),**
discovered phenylhydrazine as a
PhD student in 1875, succeeded
Hofmann at Berlin in 1900
where he built the then largest
chemical institute in the world,
and was awarded the Nobel
prize in 1902. As well as his
work on indoles, he laid the
foundations of carbohydrate
chemistry by completing the
structure and synthesis of the
main sugars. If only he hadn’t
also invented Fischer
projections.


The fi rst step in the mechanism is formation of the phenylhydrazone (the imine) of the
ketone. This can be isolated as a stable compound (Chapter 11).

The hydrazone then needs to tautomerize to the enamine, and now comes the key step in
the reaction. The enamine can rearrange with formation of a strong C–C bond and cleavage
of the weak N–N single bond by moving electrons round a six-membered ring.

Next, re-aromatization of the benzene ring (by proton transfer from carbon to nitrogen)
creates an aromatic amine that immediately attacks the other imine. This gives an aminal, the
nitrogen equivalent of an acetal.


**NH** **H** **NH**

Finally, acid-catalysed decomposition of the aminal in acetal fashion with expulsion of
ammonia allows the loss of a proton and the formation of the aromatic indole.

**NH3**

**NH** **NH** **NH**

This is admittedly a complicated mechanism but if you remember the central step—the
rearrangement of the enamine—the rest should fall into place. The key point is that the C–C
bond is established at the expense of a weak N–N bond. Naturally, Fischer had no idea of any
of the steps in the mechanism. He was sharp enough to see that something remarkable had
happened and skilful enough to fi nd out what it was.
The Fischer method is the main way of making indoles, but it is not suitable for them all. We
need now to consider its applicability to various substitution patterns. If the carbonyl compound can enolize on one side only, as is the case with an aldehyde, then the obvious product
is formed.

Another way to secure a single indole as product from the Fischer indole synthesis is to make
sure the reagents are symmetrical. These two examples should make plain the types of indole
available from symmetrical starting materials.

The substitution pattern of the fi rst example is particularly important as the neurotransmitter serotonin is an indole with a hydroxyl group in the 5-position, and many important drugs
follow that pattern. Sumatriptan (marketed as Imigran, the migraine treatment) is an analogue of serotonin, whose synthesis starts with the formation of a diazonium salt (Chapter 22)
from the aniline shown below. Nitrosation gives the diazonium salt, and reduction with
SnCl2 and HCl returns the salt of the phenylhydrazine.

All that remains is to introduce the dimethylamino group. The nitrile is reduced by
hydrogenation and the two methyl groups added by reductive amination with formaldehyde. The reducing agent is formic acid, and the reaction works by sequential formation

- The dimethylation of primary
amines (or methylation of
secondary amines) by this
method is sometimes called the
Eschweiler–Clarke method, and

and reduction of an imine, followed by an iminium formation and reduction to introduce
the second methyl group.


For some indoles it is necessary to control regioselectivity with unsymmetrical carbonyl
compounds. Ondansetron, the anti-nausea compound that is used to help cancer patients
take larger doses of antitumour compounds than was previously possible, is an example. It
contains an indole and an imidazole ring.

The 1,3 relationship between C–N and C–O suggests a Mannich reaction to add the imidazole ring (Chapters 26 and 28), and that disconnection reveals an indole with an unsymmetrical right-hand side, having an extra ketone group. Fischer disconnection will reveal a
diketone as partner for phenylhydrazine. We shall leave aside for the moment when to add the
methyl group to the indole nitrogen.

In the worst case, there is no such simple distinction between the two sites for enamine
formation and we must rely on other methods of control. The non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drug indomethacin is a good example. Removing the N-acyl group reveals an indole with
substituents in both halves of the molecule.

The Fischer indole is acid-catalysed so we must ask: on what side of the ketone is enoli zation (and therefore enamine formation) expected in acid solution? The answer (see
Chapter 20) is away from the methyl group and into the alkyl chain. This is what we want
and the reaction does indeed go this way. In fact, the tert-butyl ester is used instead of the
free acid.

There are many other indole syntheses but we will give a brief mention to only one other,
which allows the synthesis of indoles with a different substitution pattern in the benzene ring.

Ethoxide is a strong enough base to remove a proton from the methyl group, delocalizing

The rest of the synthesis is more straightforward: the nitro group can be reduced to an
amine, which immediately forms an enamine by intramolecular attack on the more reactive
carbonyl group (the ketone) to give the aromatic indole. Since the nitro compound is made by
nitration of a benzene ring, the preferred symmetry is very different from that needed for the
Fischer synthesis. Nitration of para-xylene (1,4-dimethylbenzene) is a good example.

The ester products we have been using so far can be hydrolysed and decarboxylated by the

###### Quinolines and isoquinolines

Quinoline forms part of the structure of quinine, the malaria remedy found in cinchona bark
and known since the time of the Incas. The quinoline in quinine has a 6-MeO substituent and
a side chain attached to C4. In discussing the synthesis of quinolines, we will be particularly
interested in this pattern. This is because the search for anti-malarial compounds continues
and other quinolines with similar structures are among the available anti-malarial drugs.

We shall also be very interested in quinolones, analogous to pyridones, with carbonyl
groups at positions 2 and 4, as these are useful antibiotics. A simple example is pefl oxacin,
which has typical 6-F and 7-piperazine substituents.

When we consider the synthesis of a quinoline, the obvious disconnections are, fi rst, the
C–N bond in the pyridine ring and, then, the C–C bond that joins the side chain to the
benzene ring. We will need a three-carbon (C3) synthon, electrophilic at both ends, which
will yield two double bonds after incorporation. The obvious choice is a 1,3-dicarbonyl
compound.

The choice of an aromatic amine is a good one as the NH2 group reacts well with carbonyl compounds and it activates the ortho position to electrophilic attack. However, the
dialdehyde is malonic dialdehyde, a compound that does not exist, so some alternative
must be found. If the quinoline is substituted in the 2- and 4-positions this approach
looks better.

The initially formed imine will tautomerize to a conjugated enamine and cyclization now
occurs by electrophilic aromatic substitution. The enamine will normally prefer to adopt the
fi rst confi guration shown in which cyclization is not possible, and (perhaps for this reason or
perhaps because it is diffi cult to predict which quinoline will be formed from an unsymmetrical 1,3-dicarbonyl compound) this has not proved a very important quinoline synthesis.
However, the synthetic plan is sound, and we shall describe two important variants on this
theme, one for quinolines and one for quinolones.

In the synthesis of pyridines it proved advantageous to make a dihydropyridine and oxidize
it to a pyridine afterwards. The same idea works well in probably the most famous quinoline
synthesis, the Skraup reaction. The diketone is replaced by an unsaturated carbonyl compound so that the quinoline is formed regiospecifi cally. The fi rst step is conjugate addition of
the amine. Under acid catalysis the ketone now cyclizes in the way we have just described to
give a dihydroquinoline after dehydration. Oxidation to the aromatic quinoline is an easy
step accomplished by many possible oxidants.

Traditionally, the Skraup reaction was carried out by mixing everything together and letting it rip. A typical mixture to make a quinoline without substituents on the pyridine ring
would be the aromatic amine, concentrated sulfuric acid, glycerol, and nitrobenzene all
heated up in a large fl ask at over 100 °C with a wide condenser.

The ugly name of the Skraup
reaction appropriately applies to
the worst ‘witch’s brew’ of all
the heterocyclic syntheses. Some
workers have added strange oxidizing agents such as arsenic
acid, iron (III) salts, tin (IV) salts,
nitrobenzenes of various substitution patterns, or iodine to
make it ‘go better’.


The glycerol was to provide acrolein (CH2=CH⋅CHO) by dehydration, the nitrobenzene was
to act as oxidant, and the wide condenser. . .? All too often Skraup reactions did let rip—with
destructive results. A safer approach is to prepare the conjugate adduct fi rst, cyclize it in acid
solution, and then oxidize it with one of the reagents we described for pyridine synthesis, particularly quinones such as DDQ.

The more modern style of Skraup synthesis is used to make 8-quinolinol or ‘oxine’. orthoAminophenol has only one free position ortho to the amino group and is very nucleophilic, so
acrolein can be used in weak acid with only a trace of strong acid. Iron(III) is the oxidant, with
a bit of boric acid for luck, and the yield is excellent.

###### Quinolones also come from anilines by cyclization to an ortho position

The usual method for making quinolone antibiotics is possible because they all have a carboxylic acid in the 3-position. The disconnection we used for quinoline suggests a rather unstable

In fact, the enol ether of this compound is easily made from diethyl malonate and ethyl

For examples of quinolone antibiotics we can choose ofl oxacin, whose synthesis was discussed in detail in Chapter 22, and rosoxacin, whose synthesis is discussed below. Both molecules contain the same quinolone carboxylic acid framework, outlined in black, with another

To make rosoxacin two heterocyclic systems must be constructed. Workers at the pharmaceutical company Sterling decided to build the pyridine in an ingenious version of the
Hantzsch synthesis using acetylenic esters on 3-nitrobenzaldehyde. The ammonia was added
as ammonium acetate. Oxidation with nitric acid made the pyridine, hydrolysis of the esters
and decarboxylation removed the acid groups, and reduction with Fe(II) and HCl converted
the nitro group into the amino group required for the quinolone synthesis.

Now the quinolone synthesis can be executed with the same reagents we used before and all
that remains is ester hydrolysis and alkylation at nitrogen. Notice that the quinolone cyclization could in theory have occurred in two ways as the two positions ortho to the amino group
are different. In practice cyclization occurs away from the pyridine ring as the alternative
quinolone would be impossibly crowded.

###### More heteroatoms in fused rings mean more choice in synthesis

The imidazo-pyridazine ring system forms the basis for a number of drugs in human and
animal medicine. The synthesis of this system uses the chemistry discussed in Chapter 29 to
build the pyridazine ring. There we established that it was easy to make dichloropyridazines
and to displace the chlorine atoms one by one with different nucleophiles. Now we will move
on from these intermediates to the bicyclic system.

In Chapter 29 we also gave the structure of timolol, a thiadiazole-based β-blocker drug for

and a saturated morpholine as well as an aliphatic side chain. Its synthesis relies on ring formation by rather a curious method followed by selective nucleophilic substitution, rather in the
style of the last synthesis. The aromatic ring is made by the action of S2Cl2 on ‘cyanamide’.

###### Summary: the three major approaches to the synthesis of aromatic heterocycles

We end this chapter with summaries of the three major strategies in the synthesis of
heterocycles:

 - ring construction by ionic reactions

 - ring construction by cycloadditions

 - modifi cation of existing rings by electrophilic or nucleophilic aromatic substitution or
by lithiation and reaction with electrophiles.

We will summarize the different applications of these strategies, and also suggest cases for
which each strategy is not suitable. This section revises material from Chapter 29 as well since
most of the ring modifi cations appear there.

###### Ring construction by ionic cyclization

The fi rst strategy you should try out when faced with the synthesis of an aromatic heterocyclic ring is the disconnection of bonds between the heteroatom or atoms and carbon, with
the idea of using the heteroatoms as nucleophiles and the carbon fragment as a double
electrophile.



- This is only a summary.
There are more details in the
relevant sections of Chapters 29
and 30. There are also many,
many more ways of making all
these heterocycles. These
methods are just where we
suggest you start.

Rings make a difference to the way molecules react and the ways they can be made, and we
have just devoted two chapters to the reactions and synthesis of fl at, aromatic heterocycles. In
this chapter and the one that follows we shall continue to look at rings, but not fl at aromatic
ones. Once you put saturated atoms into rings the rings become fl exible and display interesting chemical features. We introduced ways of talking about conformation in rings in Chapter
16, and we will revisit ideas from that chapter—in particular we will build on the idea that
rings make it easier to think about stereochemistry because they restrict the number of conformations a molecule can adopt. We will also introduce a theme which we develop over the
next few chapters of the book: _stereoselectivity—how to make single diastereoisomers of a_
product.
It may seem strange that heterocycles—rings containing not just carbon atoms, but oxygen,
nitrogen, or sulfur as well—deserve three whole chapters, but you will soon see that this is
justifi ed both by the sheer number and variety of heterocycles that exist and by their special
chemical features. We dealt with the special stereochemical features of aromatic heterocycles

The saturated heterocyclic rings are shown in black, and names for the most important ring types are given: some (like
piperidine, morpholine) you will need to remember; others (tetrahydrofuran, pyrrolidine) are more obviously derived from
the names for aromatic heterocycles you met in the last chapter. Some of these compounds (nicotine, coniine, cocaine)
are plant products falling into the class called alkaloids, which are discussed in Chapter 42. Another important class of
saturated heterocycles, sugars, will also appear in Chapter 42.



- Although this is the only
chapter in which
stereoelectronics appears in the
title, you will soon recognize the
similarity between the ideas we
cover here and concepts like the
stereospecifi city of E2
elimination reactions (Chapter
17) and the effect of orbital
overlap on NMR coupling
constants (Chapter 18). We will
also use orbital alignment to
explain the Karplus relationship
(Chapter 32), the Felkin–Anh
transition state (Chapter 33),
and the conformational
requirements for rearrangement
and fragmentation reactions
(Chapter 36).


But what are the ‘special chemical features’ of saturated heterocycles? Putting a heteroatom
into a ring does two important things, and these lead to the most important new topics in this
chapter.

 - Firstly, the heteroatom makes the ring easy to make by a ring-closing reaction, or (in
some cases) easy to break by a ring-opening reaction. Closing and opening reactions
of rings are subject to constraints that you will need to know about, and the
principles that govern these reactions are discussed later in the chapter.

 - Secondly, the ring fi xes the orientation of the heteroatom—and, in particular, the
orientation of its lone pairs—relative to the atoms around it. This has consequences
for the reactivity and conformation of the heterocycle which can be explained using
the concept of stereoelectronics.


###### Reactions of saturated heterocycles

 Saturated nitrogen heterocycles: amines, but more nucleophilic

In many reactions the simple saturated nitrogen heterocycles—piperidine, pyrrolidine,
piperazine, and morpholine—behave simply as secondary amines that happen to be cyclic.



- **Stereoelectronic effects are chemical consequences of the arrangement of orbitals in space.**


-----

They do the sorts of things that other amines do, acting as nucleophiles in addition and
substitution reactions. Morpholine, for example, is acylated by 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl
chloride to form the tranquillizer and muscle relaxant trimetozine, and N-methylpiperazine
can be alkylated in an SN1 reaction with diphenylmethyl chloride to give the travelsickness drug cyclizine.

Enamines formed from pyrrolidine and piperidine are particularly stable because pyrrolidine and piperidine are rather more nucleophilic than comparable acylic amines such as
diethylamine. This is a general feature of cyclic amines (and cyclic ethers, too, as you will see
shortly), and is a steric effect. The alkyl substituents, being tied back into a ring, are held clear
of the nucleophilic lone pair, allowing it to approach an electrophile without hindrance. This
effect is well illustrated by comparing the rates of reaction of methyl iodide with three
amines—tertiary this time. The two cyclic compounds are bridged—quinuclidine is a bridged
piperidine while the diamine known as DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) is a bridged
piperazine. The table below shows the relative rates, along with pKa values, for triethylamine,
quinuclidine, and DABCO.

Quinuclidine and DABCO are 40–60 times more reactive than triethylamine. This is again
due to the way the ring structures keep the nitrogen’s substituents away from interfering
with the lone pair as it attacks the electrophile. You should contrast the effect that the cyclic
structure has on the basicity of the amines: none! Triethylamine and quinuclidine are
equally basic and, as you can see in the margin, so (more or less) are diethylamine, dibutylamine, and piperidine. A proton is so small that it cares very little whether the alkyl groups
are tied back or not.
Much more important in determining pKa is how electron-rich the nitrogen is, and this is
the cause of the glaring discrepancy between the basicity of quinuclidine and that of
DABCO, or between the basicities of piperidine (pKa 11.2) and morpholine (pKa 9.8) or piperazine (pKa 8.4). The extra heteroatom, through an inductive effect, withdraws electron
density from the nitrogen atom, making it less nucleophilic and less basic. In this sense,
morpholine can be a very useful base, less basic than triethylamine but somewhat more
so than pyridine (pKa 5.2). Notice how much lower is the second pKa (that is, the pKa for
proton ation of the second nitrogen) of the diamines DABCO and piperazine: the protonated
nitrogen of the monoprotonated amine withdraws electrons very effectively from the
unprotonated one.


-----

The exposed nature of the nitrogen atom in cyclic amines means that nitrogen heterocycles
are very frequently encountered in drug molecules, particularly those operating on the central nervous system (cocaine, heroin, and morphine all contain nitrogen heterocycles, as do
codeine and many tranquillizers, such as Valium). But the ring can also be used as a support
for adding substituents that hinder the nitrogen’s lone pair. Just as the nitrogen atom of
piperidine is permanently exposed, the nitrogen atom of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine
(TMP) nestles deep in a bed of methyl groups. The lithium salt of TMP (LiTMP) is an analogue
of LDA—a base that experiences enormous steric hindrance that can be used in situations
where the selectivity even of LDA fails.

Aziridine and azetidine are stable, if volatile, members of the saturated nitrogen heterocycle
family, and aziridine has some interesting chemistry of its own. Like pyrrolidine and piperidine, aziridine can be acylated by treatment with an acyl chloride, but the product is not
stable. The ring opens with attack of chloride, a relatively poor nucleophile, and an openchain secondary amide results.

You can view this ring opening as very similar to the ring opening of an epoxide (Chapter
19)—in particular, a _protonated epoxide, in which the oxygen bears a positive charge. The_
positive charge is very important for aziridine opening because, when the reaction is done in
the presence of a base, removal of the proton leads immediately to the neutral acyl aziridine,
which is stable.

The ring opening of aziridine is a useful way of making larger heterocycles: anything that
puts a positive charge on nitrogen encourages the opening by making N a better leaving
group, whether it’s protonation or, as shown below, alkylation. Alkylation of aziridine in base
gives the N-substituted aziridine as you might expect, but a second alkylation leads to a positively charged aziridinium salt that opens immediately to a useful bromoamine.


###### Systematic nomenclature of saturated heterocycles

The names aziridine and azetidine are derived from a reasonably logical system of
nomenclature, which assigns
three-part heterocycle names
according to: (a) the heteroatom
(‘az-’ = nitrogen, ‘ox-’ = oxygen,
‘thi-’ = sulfur), (b) the ring size
(‘-ir-’ = 3, from tri; ‘-et-’ = 4,
from tetra; ‘-ol-’ = 5; nothing for
6; ‘-ep-’ = 7, from hepta;
‘-oc-’ = 8, from octa; etc.), and
(c) the degree of saturation
(‘-ene’ or ‘-ine’ for unsaturated,
‘-idine’ or ‘-ane’ for saturated).
Hence az-ir-idine, az-et-idine, diox-ol-ane, and ox-ir-ane.

We have just mentioned the protonation of aziridine, and you might imagine from what we
said earlier about the comparative nucleophilicity and basicity of nitrogen heterocycles and their
acyclic counterparts that aziridine will be even more nucleophilic than pyrrolidine, and about
as basic. Well, it isn’t. The idea that ‘tying back’ the alkyl groups increases nucleophilicity is only
valid for unstrained fi ve or six-membered rings: with small rings another effect takes over.
Aziridine is, in fact, much less basic than pyrrolidine and piperidine: the pKa for its protonation is only 8.0. This is much closer to the pKa of a compound containing an sp[2] hybridized
nitrogen atom—the imine in the margin, for example. This is because the nitrogen’s lone pair
is in an orbital with much more s character than is typical for an amine, due to the threemembered ring. This is an effect we have discussed before, in Chapter 18, and you should reread pp. 412–415 if you need to refresh your memory. There we compared three-membered
rings with alkynes, explaining that both could be deprotonated relatively easily. The anion
carries a negative charge in a low-energy orbital with much s character: the same type of
orbital carries aziridine’s lone pair.
The s character of the aziridine nitrogen’s lone pair has other effects too. The lone pair interacts very poorly with an adjacent carbonyl group, so N-acyl aziridines such as the one you saw
on p. 973 behave not at all like amides. The nitrogen atom is pyramidal and not planar, and
the stretching frequency of the C=O bond (1706 cm[−][1]) is much closer to that of a ketone
(1710 cm ) than that of an amide (1650 cm[−][1]).
The s character of the lone pair means that the nitrogen atom inverts very slowly, rather like
a phosphine. Usually it is not possible for nitrogen to be a stereogenic centre because inversion
is too rapid—the transition state for nitrogen inversions (in which the lone pair is in a p
orbital) is low in energy. But with an aziridine, getting the lone pair into a p orbital requires
much more activation energy, so nitrogen can be stereogenic. The two stereoisomers of the
_N-substituted aziridine in the margin can be separated and isolated._

###### Oxygen heterocycles

Ring-opening chemistry is characteristic of oxygen heterocycles too, and there is no need
for us to revisit epoxide opening here. Epoxides are particularly reactive because ring-opening
releases ring strain, driving the reaction forward. In general, though, oxygen heterocycles, as
cyclic ethers, are relatively unreactive: ethers are the least reactive of all the common functional groups. This is one of the main reasons why THF and dioxane are such important solvents. A second reason is that they solvate organometallics by donating a lone pair to stabilize
an electron-defi cient metal cation (Li, for example). Cyclic ethers are better donors (more
nucleophilic) than acyclic ones for the same reason that cyclic amines are more nucleophilic
than acyclic ones.
This interaction of the lone pair with a Lewis acid can be exploited to make ethers more
reactive. BF3 is commonly used to activate cyclic ethers towards nucleophilic attack, and even
with epoxides it increases the rate and yield of the reaction when organometallic reagents are
used as nucleophiles. BuLi does not react with oxetane unless a Lewis acid, such as BF3, is
added, when it opens the four-membered ring to give a quantitative yield of _n-heptanol._
Without ring strain to help the reaction along, THF, by contrast, gives only a low yield of the
product even with a Lewis acid.

-----

A more common (if often unwanted) reaction between BuLi and THF is not nucleophilic
attack, but deprotonation. You will have noticed that reactions involving BuLi in THF are
invariably carried out at temperatures of 0 °C or below—usually –78 °C. This is because, at
temperatures above 0 °C, deprotonation of THF begins to take place. The deprotonated THF is
unstable, and it undergoes a reaction we call a reverse [2 + 3] cycloaddition (see Chapter 34).
Here is the mechanism (we have represented the organolithium as an anion to help with the
arrows). The products are: (1) the (much less basic) enolate of acetaldehyde and (2) ethylene.
The fi rst tends to polymerize, and the second usually (but see the box below!) evaporates from
the reaction mixture.

###### THF stability

The half-life of n-BuLi in THF
(in the presence of TMEDA) is
40 minutes at 20 °C, 5.5 hours
at 0 °C, and 2 days at –20 °C.
Diethyl ether is much less readily
deprotonated: at 20 °C in ether
n-BuLi has a half life of 10
hours. With more basic
organolithiums, the rate of
decomposition of THF is even
faster, and t-BuLi can be used in
THF only at –78 °C. At –20 °C
t-BuLi has a half-life in THF of
only 45 minutes; in ether its
half-life at this temperature is
7.5 hours.


The most common use of tetrahydropyran derivatives is as protecting groups: you met this
in Chapter 23.

###### Sulfur heterocycles

As you saw in Chapter 27, sulfur stabilizes an adjacent anion, meaning that sulfur heterocycles are much easier to deprotonate than THF. The most important of these contains two
sulfur atoms: dithiane. Deprotonation of dithiane occurs in between the two heteroatoms,
and you saw some chemistry that arises from this on p. 661. The series of reactions below
illustrates nicely both dithiane chemistry and the ring opening of oxygen heterocycles in
the presence of BF3. This substituted derivative of dithiane is deprotonated by BuLi to give
a nucleophilic organolithium that will attack electrophiles—even oxygen heterocycles—
provided BF3 is present. The products are formed in excellent yield, even when the electrophile is THP, with no ring strain to drive the reaction. After the addition reaction the
dithiane ring can be hydrolysed with mercury(II) to give a ketone carrying other useful
functional groups.

forms decomposes by the same
mechanism as lithiated THF.

###### Conformation of saturated heterocycles

 Using NMR to study conformation: the Karplus relationship

In Chapters 13 and 18 we explained that coupling in NMR spectra is a through-bond (and not
a through-space) effect—that is why trans alkenes have bigger coupling constants than cis
alkenes, and why axial–axial coupling in six-membered rings is larger than axial–equatorial or equatorial–equatorial coupling. We now need to build some more detail into your
understanding of the relationship between conformation and coupling constants so we can
use NMR to probe the conformations adopted by saturated rings.
The coupling constants in a cyclohexane tell us that coupling is greatest when the C–H
bonds involved are most parallel—in other words when their dihedral angle is close to 180° or
0°. C–H bonds in simple cyclohexanes can have dihedral angles of only 60° or 180°, but by
examining coupling constants in a range of other compounds, it is possible to draw up a
description of the way coupling varies with dihedral angle. For example, in the bicyclic compound in the margin, the black protons have a dihedral angle close to 90° and the coupling
constant is 0 Hz. The complete correlation was worked out by Karplus in the 1960s and is
called the Karplus relationship. It is easiest to understand as a graph of J against dihedral angle.

the Karplus relationship: J vs. dihedral angle

coupling
constant
_J_

0° 90° 180°
dihedral angle H–C–C–H

Examine the graph above carefully and note these principal features:

  - Coupling is largest at 180° when the orbitals of the two C–H bonds are perfectly
parallel (the situation in a trans alkene or the trans-diaxial C–H bonds of a
cyclohexane).

  - Coupling is nearly as large at 0° when the orbitals are in the same plane but not
parallel (the situation in a cis alkene).

  - Coupling is zero when the dihedral angle is 90°—orthogonal orbitals do not interact.

  - The curve is fl attened around 0°, 90°, and 180°—J varies little in these regions from
compound to compound.

  - The curve slopes steeply at about 60° and 120°—J varies a lot in this region with small
changes of angle and from compound to compound.

  - Numerical values of J vary with substitution, ring size, etc., but the Karplus
relationship still works—it gives good relative values.

The determination of conformation by NMR may determine confi guration at the same time.
This often occurs when there are two or more substituents on the ring. Here is a simple example: you saw in Chapter 16 that the reduction of 4-t-butylcyclohexanone can be controlled by
choice of reagent to give either a cis or a trans alcohol.

The products are easy to tell apart because the green H appears quite different in the

The bulky t-butyl group always goes equatorial, and each OH group has two identical axial
neighbours and two identical equatorial neighbours (two are shown in black in the scheme at
the bottom of p. 796—there are two more at the front). Each coloured H appears as a triplet of
triplets. In the cis alcohol both couplings are small (2.72 and 3.00 Hz) but in the trans alcohol
the axial–axial coupling is much larger (11.1 Hz) than the axial–equatorial (4.3 Hz) coupling.
The same ideas can be used to study conformation in saturated _heterocyclic systems._
Hydrogenation of the double bond in this unsaturated acetal gives the saturated compound
as a single isomer. But which one? Are the two substituents, Me and OEt, cis or trans?

**H2**
or

**Me** **O** **OEt** Raney Ni **Me** **O** **OEt** **Me** **O** **OEt**

You can draw a general conclusion from this observation: an
NMR signal is roughly as wide
as the sum of all its couplings.
In any given compound, an axial
proton will have a much wider
signal than an equatorial
proton.


unsaturated acetal _cis saturated acetal_ _trans saturated acetal_

The appearance of the two black hydrogens in the NMR spectrum reveals the answer and
also shows what conformation the molecule adopts. There is a 1H signal at 3.95 ppm (which
is therefore next to oxygen) and it is a double quartet. It must be the hydrogen next to the
methyl group because of the quartet coupling. The quartet coupling constant has the ‘normal’

_J value of 6.5 Hz. The doublet coupling is 9 Hz and this is too large to be anything other than_
an axial–axial coupling. This hydrogen is axial.
There is another 1H signal at 4.40 ppm (next to two oxygens), which is a double doublet with
_J = 9 and 2 Hz. This must also be an axial proton as it shows an axial–axial (9 Hz) and an_
axial–equatorial coupling. We now know the conformation of the molecule.
Both black hydrogens are axial so both substituents are equatorial. That also means in this
case that they are cis. But note that this is because they are both on the same, upper side of the
ring, not because they are both equatorial! The hydrogen at the front has two neighbours—an
axial (brown) H, J = 9, and an equatorial (green) H, J = 2 Hz. All this fi ts the Karplus relationship as expected. You may have spotted that the H at the back appears to be missing a small
coupling to its equatorial neighbour. No doubt it does couple, but that small coupling is not
noticed in the eight lines of the double quartet. Small couplings can easily be overlooked.
When this compound is allowed to stand in slightly acidic ethanol it turns into an isomer.
This is the trans compound and its NMR spectrum is again very helpful. The proton next to
the methyl group is more or less the same but the proton in between the two oxygen atoms is
quite different. It is at 5.29 ppm and is an unresolved signal of width about 5 Hz. In other
words it has no large couplings and must be an equatorial proton. The conformation of the
_trans compound is shown in the margin._
Because coupling constants in six-membered rings are well-defi ned, the formation of a
heterocyclic ring can be used as a tool to determine stereochemistry. Suppose you have one
diastereoisomer of a 1,3-diol and you want to fi nd out which stereoisomer it is. You might
think of using the NMR coupling constants of the two black protons. But that will do no good
because the molecule has no fi xed conformation. Free rotation about all the σ bonds means
that the Karplus equation cannot be used and a time-averaged value of about 6–7 Hz will
probably be observed for both protons regardless of stereochemistry.
Suppose now we make an acetal from the 1,3-diol with benzaldehyde. Acetal formation is
under thermodynamic control, so the most stable possible conformation will result with the
large phenyl group equatorial and the two R groups either both equatorial or one equatorial
and one axial, depending on which diastereoisomer you started with.

Now the molecule has a fi xed conformation and the coupling constants of the black Hs to
the neighbouring CH2 group can be determined—an axial H will show one large J value, an
equatorial H only small J values.


-----

The [3]J coupling between the black hydrogens in this compound was 4.1 Hz, much the same as in the antibiotic and,
when the ester group was hydrolysed in aqueous base, the main product was identical to natural chuangxinmycin.
However, there was a minor product, which was the trans isomer. It had [3]J = 6.0 Hz. Note how much smaller this value
is than the axial–axial couplings of 10 Hz or more in saturated six-membered rings. The fl attening of the ring reduces the
dihedral angle, reducing the size of J.


Coupling constants do not always give unambiguous information about stereochemistry,
and in the next section we look at one technique which allows structural information to be
extracted from NMR spectra without relying on coupling.

###### Determining stereochemistry when coupling constants are no help: the nuclear Overhauser effect

The coupling constant between the green protons of the compound below is rather large, at
11 Hz—about the same as the trans diaxial coupling in a cyclohexane. The Karplus relationship suggests the green protons must therefore spend much of their time with their bonds
arranged with a dihedral angle close to 180°, and from this we can deduce that the compound
has the conformation, as well as the confi guration, shown. A more diffi cult problem is the
assignment of the stereochemistry of the elimination product from this bromoamine and
base. It’s not a simple question, because the elimination also involves rearrangement of the
amino group. The product is an alkene with two possible geometries.

Usually we would use coupling constants to determine alkene geometry, but they are no use
here as there is only one proton on the alkene: it will be a singlet in both compounds. In such
cases, we can make use of a quirk of NMR known as the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE). NOE
is rather different from coupling in the information it provides: it tells us which hydrogens are
**close in space rather than their relationship through bonds as revealed by coupling constants.**
The details of the origin of the nuclear Overhauser effect are beyond the scope of this book,
but we can give you a general idea of what the effect is. As you learned in Chapters 3 and 13,
when a proton NMR spectrum is acquired, a pulse of radio frequency electromagnetic radiation jolts the spins of the protons in the molecule into a higher energy state. The signal we
observe is generated by those spins dropping back to their original states. So far we have
assumed that the drop back down is spontaneous, just like a rock falling off a cliff. In fact it
isn’t—something needs to ‘help’ the protons to drop back again—a process called relaxation.
And that ‘something’ is other nearby magnetically active nuclei—usually more protons.
Notice nearby—nearby in space not through bonds. With protons, relaxation is always fast,
and the number of nearby protons does not affect the appearance of the NMR spectrum.
Although in a normal spectrum peak intensity is independent of the number of nearby
protons, by using methods whose description is beyond the scope of this book it is possible to
modify the intensity of the peaks very slightly according to the number of protons that are
nearby. The basis of the method is that certain protons (or groups of identical protons) are
irradiated selectively (in other words, they are jolted into their high energy state and held
there by a pulse of radiation at exactly the right frequency—not the broad pulse needed in a
normal NMR experiment). Under the conditions of the experiment, this causes protons that
_were relying on those irradiated protons to relax them to appear as a slightly more intense (by_
maybe just a few per cent) peak in the NMR spectrum. This effect is known as the nuclear
Overhauser effect, and the increase in intensity of the peak the nuclear Overhauser enhancement. Both are shortened to ‘NOE’.


###### Why you can’t integrate [13]C NMR spectra

Relaxation is the real reason
why you can’t integrate [13]C signals. Relaxation of [13]C is slow,
but is fastest with lots of nearby
protons. This is the reason that
you will often fi nd that –CH3
groups show strong signals in
the [13]C NMR, while quaternary
carbons, with no attached protons, show weak ones: quaternary carbons relax only slowly,
so we don’t detect such an
intense peak. Allowing plenty of
time for all [13]C atoms to relax
between pulses gives more proportionally sized peaks, but at
the expense of a very long NMR
acquisition time.


-----

All you need to be aware of at this stage is that irradiating protons in an NOE experiment
gives rise to enhancements at other protons that are nearby in space—no coupling is required,
and NOE is _not a through-bond phenomenon. The effect also drops off very rapidly: the_
degree of enhancement is proportional to 1/r[6] (where r is the distance between the protons) so
moving two protons twice as far apart decreases the enhancement one can give to the other
by a factor of 64. NOE spectra are usually presented as differences: the enhanced spectrum
minus the unenhanced, so that the small enhancements of intensity in the peaks of certain
protons can be spotted immediately.
Applying NOE to the problem in hand solves the structure. If the protons next to the nitrogen
atom in the piperidine ring are irradiated, the signal for the alkene proton increases in intensity,
so these two groups of protons must be near in space. The compound is the E alkene.

Data from NOE experiments nicely supplement information from coupling constants in the
determination of three-dimensional stereochemistry too. Reduction of this bicyclic ketone with
a bulky hydride reducing agent gives one diastereoisomer of the alcohol, but which? Irradiation
of the proton next to the OH group leads to an NOE to the green proton. This suggests that the
two protons are on the same side of the molecule and that reduction has occurred by hydride
delivery to the face of the ketone opposite the two methyl groups on the three-membered ring.

A combination of coupling constants and NOE effects is routinely used to assign the stereochemistry of reaction products.

###### Heteroatoms in rings have axial and equatorial lone pairs

To a fi rst approximation, the conformation of fi ve- and six-membered saturated heterocycles
follows very much the same principles as the conformation of carbocyclic compounds that we
detailed in Chapter 16. For dithiane the conformation is as shown in the margin. Since the
sulfur atoms have lone pairs, they too occupy axial and equatorial positions. The same is true
of dioxane or of piperidine.
We have coloured the lone pairs green or black according to whether they are axial or equatorial, but you can also consider the colour coding in a different way: black lone pairs are
parallel with C–C or C–heteroatom bonds in the ring; green lone pairs are parallel with axial
C–H bonds outside the ring, or, if the ring has substituents, with the bonds to those substituents. This substituted tetrahydropyran illustrates all this. Notice that the equatorial substituents next to the heteroatom are parallel with neither the green nor the black lone pair.
Why is this important? There are many reactions in which lone pairs have an important
role to play. For example, in an acetal hydrolysis, stabilization of the forming positive charge
by an adjacent lone pair facilitates the elimination step of the mechanism. Let’s consider what
happens in this acetal hydrolysis where the acetal is a saturated heterocycle. From Chapter 11,
you expect this to be the mechanism:

-----

Yet when we try to draw the conformation of the lone pairs we run into a problem: neither
overlaps with the C–O bond that is breaking and so neither can donate its electron density
into the C–O σ*. Another way of looking at this is to say that the intermediate oxonium ion—
with a C=O double bond formed by one of the oxygen’s lone pairs—would be extremely
strained. Not surprisingly, the rate of hydrolysis of this acetal is very slow compared with similar ones in which overlap between the oxygen lone pair and the C–O σ* is possible. The acetal
on the right hydrolyses about 10[10] times faster.

You have just seen that overlap between orbitals governs NMR coupling constants; other
situations where orbital overlap is important are:

 - E2 elimination reactions (Chapter 17)

 - reactions of cyclic molecules (Chapter 32)

 - the Felkin–Anh transition state conformation (Chapter 33)

 - fragmentations and rearrangements (Chapter 36).

Together, these effects are called stereoelectronic effects because they all depend on the orien_tation of orbitals._

###### Some substituents of saturated heterocycles prefer to be axial: the anomeric effect

Many of the stereoelectronic effects in the list above govern reactivity, but the next section
will deal with how stereoelectronic effects affect structure—and in particular conformation.
Some of the most important saturated oxygen heterocycles are the sugars. Glucose is a cyclic
hemiacetal—a pentasubstituted tetrahydropyran if you like—whose major conformation in
solution is shown below. About two-thirds of glucose in solution exists as this stereoisomer,
but hemiacetal formation and cleavage is rapid, and this is in equilibrium with a further
one-third that carries the hemiacetal hydroxyl group axial (<1% is in the open-chain form).

Having read Chapter 16 you will not be surprised that glucose prefers all its substituents to
be equatorial. For four of them, of course, there is no choice: they are either all-equatorial or
all-axial, and the only way they can get from one to the other is by ring-fl ipping. But for the
fi fth substituent, the hydroxyl group next to the ring oxygen (known as the anomeric
hydroxyl group), a choice between axial or equatorial is made available by hemiacetal cleavage and re-formation—it can invert its confi guration. What is perhaps surprising is that the
equatorial preference of this hydroxyl group is so small—only 2:1. Even more surprising is
that, for most derivatives of glucose, the anomeric substituents prefer to be axial rather than
equatorial.

Move away from glucose and the effect is still there in other substituted tetrahydropyrans. Listed below are the NMR signals of the chloro compound in the margin. There are
now only two possible conformations (no confi gurational changes are possible because
this is not a hemiacetal)—both shown—and from the NMR spectrum you should be able
to work out which one this compound has.

δ J, Hz

5.78 1H t 2.0 H1

5.03 2H m H2, H3

4.86 1H m H4

4.37 1H dd 12.9, 3.0 H5a

3.75 1H ddd 12.9, 3.7,0.6 H5b

2.10 9H s OAc × 3

The key point is that axial–axial couplings are large (>8 Hz, say), even with adjacent electronegative atoms (which tend to lower coupling constants). So if H1 were an axial proton, you
would expect it to have a large coupling to H2. But it doesn’t—it couples to H2 with J of only
2.0 Hz. (The other coupling is a W-coupling to H3, also of 2.0 Hz: see p. 296.) Similarly, we
know that the 12.9 Hz coupling shared by the two H5 protons must be a geminal ([2]J) coupling.
One of H5a or H5b must be axial, yet both couple to H4 with J < 4 Hz, so H4 cannot be axial.
With this evidence, we have to conclude that H1 and H4 (and therefore H2 and H3) are equatorial, so the compound must exist mainly in the all-axial conformation. (The 0.6 Hz coupling to H5b is another W-coupling, and shows that H5b is the equatorial proton and H5a
therefore the axial one.) This axial preference is called the anomeric effect.

 - **The anomeric effect**

**In general, any tetrahydropyran bearing an electronegative substituent in the 2-position will**
**prefer that substituent to be axial. This is is known as the anomeric effect.**

X axial is more stable than X equatorial

But why? This goes against all of what we said in Chapter 16 about axial substituents being
more hindered, making conformations carrying axial substituents disfavoured. The key again
is stereoelectronics, and we can now link up with the message we left you with at the end of the
last section: elimination reactions are possible only when the orbitals involved are parallel.
An amide is more stable (less reactive) than a ketone because the p orbital of the N and the
low-lying C=O π* of the carbonyl can lie parallel—they can overlap and electron density can
move from nitrogen into the C=O bond, weakening C=O. (Evidence for this comes from the
lower IR stretching frequency of an amide C=O, among other things.) But C–X bonds also
have low-lying antibonding orbitals—the C–X σ*—so we would expect a molecule likewise to
be stabilized if an adjacent heteroatom could donate electrons into this orbital. Take the
generalized tetrahydropyran in the box above, for example, with X=Cl, say. This molecule is
most stable if an oxygen lone pair can overlap with C–Cl σ*, as shown in the margin.
But it can do this only if the chlorine is axial! Remember what we pointed out earlier: the
oxygen’s equatorial lone pairs are parallel with nothing but bonds in the ring, so the oxygen’s
axial lone pair is the only one that can help stabilize the molecule, and it can only do this
when the Cl is axial. Only the axial conformation benefi ts from the stabilization, and this is
the origin of the anomeric effect.
How shall we represent the stabilization? Comparing again with the amide stabilization, you
might think about how to represent it with curly arrows: this is straightforward with the amide
and you have seen it many times. But it looks odd with our heterocycle: electron density moves

from O to Cl, and the C–Cl bond is weakened. If the process carried right on, Cl[−] would leave.
This is exactly what did happen in the acetal we presented you with as an example on p. 801:
only the axial OAr could leave, however, because of the same requirement for overlap with an
oxygen lone pair. In the real structure that we are now looking at, the Cl is still there: the C–Cl
bond is weaker, and some of the oxygen’s electron density is delocalized on to Cl. This can be
seen in crystal structures: compounds exhibiting an anomeric effect have a longer (and therefore weakened) bond outside the ring and a shorter, stronger C–O bond within the ring.

###### The anomeric effect in spiroketals

Now that you know about the anomeric effect, you should add it to your mental array of possible ways to explain ‘unexpected’ results. Here is an example. Many fruit fl ies have pheromones based around a ‘spiroketal’ structure, which we could represent without stereochemistry
as shown below. You can imagine the spiroketal (that is, an acetal of a ketone made of two
rings joined at a single atom) being made from a dihydroxyketone—and, indeed, this is very
often how they are made synthetically. But this is a bad representation because these compounds do have stereochemistry, and the stereochemistry is very interesting.

Let’s start with the simplest example, with R=H (a pheromone of the olive fl y). Once you
have drawn one ring in its chair conformation, there are three ways of attaching the other
ring, shown here. If you think they all look the same, consider the orientation of each C–O
bond with respect to the ring that it is not part of: you can have each C–O axial or equatorial,
and there are three possible arrangements (three conformations).

Without knowing about the anomeric effect, you would fi nd it hard to predict which conformation is favoured, and, indeed, you might expect to get a mixture of all three. But NMR
tells us that this compound exists entirely in one conformation: the last one here, in which
each oxygen is axial on the other ring. Only in this conformation can both C–O bonds
benefi t from an anomeric effect—this is often known as the double anomeric effect.

###### Related effects in other types of compounds

The key requirement for the anomeric effect is that there is a heteroatom with a lone pair (O,
N, S usually) adjacent to (that is, in a position to interact with) a low-lying antibonding
orbital—usually a C–X σ* (where X=halogen or O). The C–X bond doesn’t have to be within
the ring—for example, the nitrogen heterocycle on the left prefers to have the R group axial
so that the nitrogen gets an equatorial lone pair. Equatorial lone pairs are parallel with bonds
within the ring, one of which is C–O, and this conformation is therefore stabilized by an N
lone pair/C–O σ* interaction.

It would be a bit much for the 1,3,5-triazine on the right to have all three t-butyl groups axial
(too much steric hindrance), but it can get away with having one of them axial, benefi tting
from the resulting equatorial lone pair, which can overlap with two C–N σ*s in the ring.
It’s not only in six-membered rings that stereoelectronic interactions between fi lled and
unfi lled orbitals stabilize some conformations more than others. Stereoelectronic effects control the conformations of many types of molecules.

We shall look at three common compounds that are stabilized by stereoelectronic effects: in
two cases, the stabilization is specifi c to one conformation, and we can use stereoelectronics
to explain what would otherwise be an unexpected result.
We start with a compound that is so simple that it has only one conformation because it
has no rotatable bonds: dichloromethane. You may have wondered why it is that, while
methyl chloride (chloromethane) is a reactive electrophile that takes part readily in substitution reactions, dichloromethane is so unreactive that it can be used as a solvent in which
substitution reactions of other alkyl halides take place. You may think that this is a steric
effect: indeed, Cl is bigger than H. But CH2Cl2 is much less reactive as an electrophile than
ethyl chloride or propyl chloride: there must be more to its unreactivity. And there is:
dichloro methane benefi ts from a sort of ‘permanent anomeric effect’. One lone pair of each
chlorine is always anti-periplanar to the other C–Cl bond so that there is always stabilization
from this effect.
Among the most widespread classes of acyclic compounds to exhibit stereoelectronic control over conformation are acetals. Take the simple acetal of formaldehyde and methanol, for
example: what is its conformation? An obvious suggestion is to draw it fully extended so that
every group is fully antiperiplanar to every other—this would be the lowest energy conformation of pentane, which you get if you just replace the Os with CH2s.
The trouble is, in this conformation none of the oxygen lone pairs get the chance to donate
into the C–O σ* orbitals. Although putting the bonds anti-periplanar to one another makes
steric sense, electronically, the molecule much prefers to put the lone pairs anti-periplanar to
the C–O bonds, so the bonds themselves end up gauche (synclinal) to one another. This is
known as the gauche effect, but is really just another way in which the stereoelectronic effects
that give rise to the anomeric effect turn up in acyclic systems.
Finally, an even more familiar example that you may never have thought about. You are
well aware now that amides are planar, with partially double C–N bonds, and that tertiary
amides have one alkyl group _cis to oxygen and one_ _trans. But what about esters? Esters_
are less reactive than acyl chlorides because of donation from the oxygen p orbital into the
carbonyl π*, so we expect them to be planar too, and they are. But there are two possible
planar conformations for an ester: one with R cis to oxygen and one with R trans. Which is
preferred?

Here are the two conformations drawn out for ethyl acetate. When the ethyl group (= R) and
O are cis, not only can one oxygen lone pair interact with the C=O π*, but the other lone pair
can also donate into the σ* of the C=O bond. This is not possible when Et and O are trans: they
are no longer anti-periplanar. The cis conformation of esters is generally the preferred one, even
in formate esters, where the alkyl group ends up in what is clearly a more sterically hindered
orientation.

Cyclic esters—lactones—cannot lie cis because of the ring, and this is one of the reasons
why lactones are distinctly more reactive than esters and in many reactions behave more like
ketones: lactones are quite easy to reduce with NaBH4, for example.

###### Making heterocycles: ring-closing reactions

We have talked about the structure of saturated heterocycles, particularly with regard to
stereoelectronic control over conformation, and before that we looked at some of their reactions. We will now look at how to make them. By far the most important way of making
them is by ring-closing reactions because we can usually use the heteroatom as the nucleophile in an intramolecular substitution or addition reaction. Ring-closing reactions are, of
course, just the opposite of the ring-opening reactions we talked about earlier in the chapter, and we can start with a reaction that works well in both directions: ring closure to form
an epoxide. You know well that epoxides can be formed using m-CPBA and an alkene, but
you have already seen examples where they form by an intramolecular substitution reaction
such as this.

The same method can also be used to generate larger cyclic ethers. Oxetane, for example, is
conveniently made by adding 3-chloropropyl acetate to hot potassium hydroxide. The fi rst
step in this reaction is the hydrolysis of the ester. The alkoxide produced then undergoes an
intramolecular substitution reaction to yield oxetane.

2-chloroethylamine. Related reactions can be used to form three-, fi ve-, and six-membered
nitrogen heterocycles, but fail to form four-membered rings. In fact, four-membered rings are
generally among the hardest of all to form.

rates for another ring-closing reaction, this time forming four- to seven-membered rings that
are not even heterocycles by intramolecular alkylation of a substituted malonate. Although
the numbers are quite different in the two cases, the ups and downs are the same, and the

re-reading p. 366. We will deal
with what happens in large
rings a little later.


We show the numbers in colour to highlight the fact that this seemingly illogical ordering
of numbers actually conceals two superimposed trends. Once you get to fi ve-membered rings,
the rate of formation drops consistently as the ring size moves from ‘normal’ (5 and 6) to
‘medium’ (8 to 13) sized rings. ‘Small’ (3 and 4) rings insert into the sequence after 6.
The reason for the two superimposed trends is two opposing factors. Firstly, small rings form
slowly because forming them introduces ring strain. This ring strain is there even at the transition state, raising its energy and slowing down the reaction. The activation energy for forming


-----

a three-membered ring is very high, due to strain, but decreases as the ring gets larger. This
explains why three- and four-membered rings don’t fi t straightforwardly into the sequence.
But if the reaction rate simply depended on the strain of the product, the slowest reaction
would be the formation of the three-membered ring, and six-membered rings (which are
essentially strain-free) would form fastest. Yet the data shows that four-membered rings form
more slowly than three-membered ones, and fi ve-membered ones faster than six-membered
ones. To explain this, we need to remind you of an equation we presented in Chapter 12.

ΔG[‡] = ΔH[‡] − _TΔS[‡]_

The activation energy barriers ΔG[‡] of our reactions are made up of two parts: an enthalpy of
activation ΔH[‡], which tells us about the energy required to bring atoms together against the
strain and repulsive forces they usually have, and an entropy of activation ΔS[‡], which tells us
about how easy it is to form an ordered transition state from a wriggling and randomly rotating molecule.
ΔG[‡] for three- and four-membered ring formation is large because ΔH[‡] is large: energy is
needed to bend the molecule into the strained small-ring conformation. ΔH[‡] for fi ve-, six-, and
seven-membered rings is smaller: this is the quantifi able representation of the ‘ring strain’ factor we have just introduced. The second factor is one that depends on ΔS[‡]: how much order
must be imposed on the molecule to get it to react. Think of it this way: a long chain has a lot
of disorder, and to get its ends to meet up and react means it has to give up a lot of freedom. So,
for the formation of medium and large rings, ΔS[‡] is large and negative, contributing to a large
ΔG[‡] and slow reactions. For three-membered rings, on the other hand, the reacting atoms are
already very close together and almost no order needs to be imposed on the molecule to get it
to cyclize: rotation about just one bond is all that is needed to ensure that the amine group is
in the perfect position to attack the σ* of the C–Br bond in our example above. ΔS[‡] is very small
for three-membered rings so, while ΔH[‡] is large, there is little additional contribution from the
_TΔS[‡] term and cyclization is relatively fast. Four-membered rings suffer the worst of both_
worlds: forming a four-membered ring introduces ring strain (ΔH[‡]) and requires order (ΔS[‡]) to
be imposed on the molecule. They form very slowly as a result.

###### Thermodynamic control over ring size

In this section we have discussed the rate at which rings form: in other words the kinetics of
ring formation. However, there are many ring-forming reactions that are under thermodynamic and not kinetic control. For example, you have already seen that glucose exists predominantly as a six-membered ring in solution. It could also exist as a fi ve-membered ring: it
doesn’t because although fi ve-membered rings form faster than six-membered ones, they
are usually less stable (remember, a six-membered ring is essentially strain-free). For similar
thermo dynamic reasons, it doesn’t exist as a seven-membered ring, even though you can
draw a reasonable structure for it.

Don’t be put off by the way in which we have had to twist half the molecule round to draw
the left-hand structure: the stereochemistry hasn’t changed. The important thing is that acetone reacts with mannitol to form three fi ve-membered acetals (dioxolanes) while benzaldehyde forms only two six-membered acetals. This is quite a common result: when there is
a choice, acetone prefers to react across a 1,2-diol to give a fi ve-membered acetal, while aldehydes prefer to react across a 1,3-diol to form a six-membered acetal. Drawing a conformational diagram of the product on the right helps to explain why. All of the substituents are
equatorial, making this a particularly stable structure. Now imagine what would happen if
acetone formed this type of six-membered ring acetal. There would always be an axial methyl
group, and the six-membered rings would be less stable.

###### Combatting ΔS[‡]—the Thorpe–Ingold effect

The rate of ring formation is affected not just by ring size but by substituents on the ring being
formed. Compare the following relative rates (krel) for epoxide-forming cyclization reactions.
The second looks as though it suffers more steric hindrance but nonetheless it is tens of thousands of times faster!

**Cl** **_krel = 1_** **Cl** **_krel = 4 × 10[4]_**

Adding substituents to other ring-forming reactions makes them go faster too: in the next
two examples the products are oxetanes and pyrrolidines.

This effect is quite general, and is known as the Thorpe–Ingold effect after the fi rst chemists
to note its existence, in 1915.



- **The Thorpe–Ingold effect**

**The Thorpe–Ingold effect is the way in which substituents on the ring increase the rate, or**
**equilibrium constant, for ring-forming reactions.**


As the box says, it’s not only rate that can be affected by additional substitution. Here are
the relative equilibrium constants for the formation of an anhydride from a 1,4-dicarboxylic
acid (the unsubstituted acid is called succinic acid, and the values are scaled so that Krel for the
formation of succinic anhydride is 1). More substituents mean more cyclized product at equilibrium. The Thorpe–Ingold effect is both a kinetic and a thermodynamic phenomenon.

**CO2H**


Now we need to explain why this is. The explanation comes in two parts, one of which may
be more important than the other, depending on the ring being formed. The fi rst part is more
applicable to the formation of small rings, such as the fi rst example we gave you.
If you measure the bond angles of chains of carbon atoms, you expect them to be close to
the tetrahedral angle, 109.5°. The crystal structure of the 1,3-dicarboxylic acid in the margin,
for example, shows a C–C–C bond angle of 110°. Now imagine adding substituents to the
chain. They will repel the carbon atoms already there, and force them a little closer than they
were, making the bond angle slightly less. X-ray crystallography tells us that adding two
methyl groups to our 1,3-dicarboxylic acid decreases the bond angle by about 4°.
We can assume that the same is true in the alcohol starting materials for the epoxide-forming reactions on p. 808 (we can’t measure the angle directly because the compounds aren’t
crystalline). Now consider what happens when both of these alcohols form an epoxide. The
bond angle has to become about 60°, which involves about 50° of strain for the fi rst diacid, but
only 46° for the second. By distorting the starting material, the methyl groups have made it
slightly easier to form a ring.
This part of the argument works only for small rings. For larger rings, we need another
explanation, and it involves entropy. We’ll use the pyrrolidine-forming reaction as an example. We have explained the effect of ΔS[‡] (entropy of activation) on the rate of ring formation:
as larger rings form they have to lose more entropy at the transition state, and this contributes
to a less favourable ΔG[‡].

But, when the starting material has more substituents, it starts off with less entropy anyway.
More substituents mean that some conformations are no longer accessible to the starting
material—the green arcs on the structures on the right above show how the methyl groups
hinder rotation of the N and CH2Br substituents into that region of space. Of those fewer conformations, many approximate to the conformation in the transition state, and moving from
starting material to transition state involves a smaller loss of entropy: ΔS[‡] is less negative so
ΔG[‡] (= ΔH[‡] – _TΔS[‡]) is more negative and the ring forms faster. The same arguments apply to ΔS_
for the reaction as a whole (the difference in entropy between starting material and products),
so increased substitution favours ring closure even under thermodynamic control.

###### Baldwin’s rules

Nearly all of the cyclization reactions that we have discussed have been intramolecular
SN2 reactions where one end of the molecule acted as the nucleophile displacing the leaving group on the other end. We kept to this sort of reaction in order to make valid comparisons between different ring sizes. But you can imagine making saturated heterocycles
in plenty of other ways—intramolecular substitution at a carbonyl group, for example,
such as happens in this lactonization reaction, or intramolecular addition of an oxyanion
on to an alkyne.

Cyclization reactions can be classifi ed by a simple system involving: (1) the ring size being
formed, (2) whether the bond that breaks as the ring forms is inside (endo) or outside (exo) the
new ring, and (3) whether the electrophile is an sp (digonal), sp[2] (trigonal), or sp[3] (tetrahedral)
atom. This system places three of the cyclizations just shown in the following classes.

**1.** The ring being formed has three members; the breaking C–Br bond is outside the new
ring (exo); the C carrying Br is a tetrahedral (sp[3]) atom (tet).

**2.** The ring being formed has fi ve members; the breaking C=O bond is outside the new
ring (exo); the C being attacked is a trigonal (sp[2]) atom (trig).

**3.** The ring being formed has six members; the breaking C≡C bond is inside the new
ring (endo); the C being attacked is a digonal (sp) atom (dig).

The classes of cyclization reactions are important, not because we have a compulsive
Victorian desire to classify everything, but because which class a reaction falls into determines whether or not it is likely to work. Not all cyclizations are successful, even though they
may look fi ne on paper! The guidelines that describe which reactions will work are known as
_Baldwin’s rules: empirical observations backed up by some sound stereoelectronic reasoning._
Reactions can be classifi ed according to these rules as ‘favoured’ and ‘disfavoured’. We will
deal with the rules step by step and then summarize them in a table at the end.
Firstly, and not surprisingly (because we have been talking about them for much of this
chapter):


6-endo-dig



- **all exo-tet cyclizations are favoured**


and, similarly (again you can fi nd many examples in this book):



- **all exo-trig cyclizations are favoured**


-----

Despite the variation in rate we have described for this type of reaction, exo-tet cyclizations
have no stereoelectronic problems: the lone pair and the C–X σ* (X is the leaving group) can
overlap successfully irrespective of ring size. The ring closures in the table on p. 809 all fall
into this category. The same is true for exo-trig reactions: it is easy for the nucleophilic lone
pair to overlap with the C=X π* to form a new bond. Examples include lactone formation such
as the one on p. 810.

[n+3]-exo-tet ring closure [n+3]-exo-trig ring closure


Professor Sir Jack Baldwin
worked in Oxford and adumbrated his Rules in 1976 while at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. He has studied biosynthesis (the way living things
make molecules) extensively,
especially in relation to the penicillins, and has applied many
biosynthetic ideas to laboratory
synthetic problems. Baldwin’s
rules differ in a fundamental way
from the Woodward–Hoffman
rules you will meet in Chapters
34 and 35.

_Endo-tet reactions are rather different. For a start:_



- **5 and 6-endo-tet are disfavoured.**


_Endo-tet reactions would not actually make a ring, but they fall conveniently into the sys-_
tem and we will look at them here. Here is a reaction that looks as though it contradicts what
we have just said. The arrows in the reasonable-looking mechanism on the right describe a
6-endo-tet process because the breaking Me–O bond is within the six-membered ring transition state (even if no ring is formed).

But Eschenmoser showed that, for all its appeal (intramolecular reactions usually outpace
all alternatives), this mechanism is wrong. He mixed together the starting material for the
reaction above with the hexadeuterated compound shown below, and re-ran the reaction. If
the reaction had been intramolecular, the products would have contained either no deuterium, or six deuteriums. In the event, the product mixture contained about 25% of each of
these compounds, with a further 50% containing three deuteriums. The products cannot
have been formed intramolecularly, and this distribution is exactly what would be expected
from an intermolecular reaction.


The Woodward–Hoffmann rules
were deduced from theory, and
examples were gradually discovered that fi tted them. They cannot be violated: a ‘forbidden’
reaction that appears to disobey
the Woodward–Hoffmann rules is
getting around them by following
a different mechanism. Baldwin’s
rules were formulated by making
observations of reactions that do,
or do not, work. This is why they
are couched in terms of
‘favoured’ and ‘dis f avoured’ reactions, rather than ‘allowed’ and
‘forbidden’ ones.

With endo-trig reactions, whether they work or not depends on the ring size.



- **3-, 4-, and 5-endo-trig are disfavoured; 6 and 7-endo-trig are favoured.**


The most important case in the endo-trig class is the disfavoured 5-endo-trig reaction and, if
there is one message you take away from this section, it should be that 5-endo-trig reactions
are disfavoured. The reason we say this is that 5-endo-trig cyclizations are reactions that look
perfectly fi ne on paper, and at fi rst sight it seems quite surprising that they won’t work. This
intramolecular conjugate addition, for example, appears to be a reasonable way of making a
substituted pyrrolidine.

Why is 5-endo-trig so bad? The problem is that the nitrogen’s lone pair has problems reaching round to the π* orbital of the Michael acceptor. There is no problem reaching as far as the
electrophilic carbon in the plane of the substituents but, if it bends out of this plane, which it
must if it is to overlap with the π* orbitals, it moves too far away from the methylene carbon
to react. It’s like a dog chained just out of reach of a bone.

We warned you to look out for 5-endo-trig reactions because they are disfavoured even
though on paper they look fi ne. Now the alert is the other way round! We expect you’d agree
that these endo-dig reactions look awful on paper: the linear alkyne seems to put the electrophilic carbon well out of reach of the nucleophile, even further away than in the 5-endo-trig
reaction. The important thing with endo-dig cyclizations, though, is that the alkyne has two
π* orbitals, one of which must always lie in the plane of the new ring, making it much easier
for the nucleophile to get at.

These reactions are less important and we will not discuss them in detail.

###### Baldwin’s rules and ring opening

Baldwin’s rules work because they are based on whether or not orbital overlap can be readily
achieved in the conformation required at the transition state. But the transition state is the
same whether the reaction is going forwards or backwards—the principle of microscopic revers_ibility (which is discussed further in Chapter 39) says that, if a reaction goes via a certain_
mechanism, the reverse reaction must follow exactly the same path in the opposite direction.
So Baldwin’s rules also apply to ring-opening reactions. This is where the unfavourability of
5-endo-trig really is important: this tetrahydrofuranyl ester, for example, looks set up to do an
E1cB elimination in base. Indeed, when it is treated with methoxide in deuterated methanol
it exchanges the proton α to the ester for deuterium, proving that the enolate forms. But is
does not eliminate: elimination would be a reverse 5-endo-trig process and is disfavoured.

Whenever you think about a ring-opening reaction, consider its reverse, and assess whether
it is favoured according to Baldwin’s rules.
Baldwin’s rules can be summarized in a chart. You should note the general outline of this
chart: commit to memory that, broadly speaking, endo-tet and endo-trig are disfavoured; exo_tet and exo-trig are favoured, and the reverse for dig. Then you just need to learn the cut-off_
points that indicate the exceptions to this broad-brush view: 6-endo-trig falls into the favoured
category while 4-exo-dig falls into the disfavoured one. And, if you really can remember only
one thing, it should be that 5-endo-trig is disfavoured!

###### Ring size and NMR

On p. 796 we considered the effect of changes in the dihedral angle on coupling constants.
But the dihedral angle is not the only angle worth measuring: we should also consider how
the two C–H bonds are spread out in space. The dihedral angle is what we see when we look
down the spine of the book in our earlier analogy—now we want to look at the pages in the
normal way, at right angles to the spine, as if we were going to read the book. We can show
what we mean by fi xing the dihedral angle at 0° (the C–H bonds are in the same plane) and
looking at the variation of J with the ring size of some simple cyclic alkenes.

The wider apart the hydrogens are spread, the smaller the coupling constant. Remember,
the dihedral angle stays the same (0°)—we are just varying the angle in the plane. A dramatic
illustration of this comes with the product of dehydrogenation of the natural product guaiol
with elemental sulfur. From the brown, smelly reaction mixture, guaiazulene, a deep blue oil,
can be distilled.

Some assignments are clear. The 6H doublet and the 1H septuplet are the isopropyl group,
and the two 3H singlets belong to the two methyl groups—we can’t really say which belongs
to which. The 1H singlet must be the green hydrogen as it has no neighbours and that leaves
us with two coupled pairs of protons. One pair has J = 4 Hz and the other J = 11 Hz. From the
values above, we expect to fi nd larger coupling where the H–C–C–H angle is smaller, so we
can say that the 4 Hz coupling is between the pair on the fi ve-membered ring and the 11 Hz
coupling is between the pair on the seven-membered ring.
When protons on a double bond in a ring have neighbours on saturated carbon, the coupling constants are all small and for the same reason—the angles in the plane of the ring are
approaching 90° even though the dihedral angles are 45–60° in the examples on the left. A
bizarre result of this is that the [3]J coupling between the red and black hydrogens is often about

the same as the allylic ([4]J) coupling between the red and the green hydrogens. An example
follows in a moment.
The ‘spreading out’ effect also affects vicinal ([3]J) couplings in simple saturated rings. No
other ring size has so well defi ned a conformation as that of the six-membered ring, but we can
still note useful trends as we move from 6 to 5 to 4 to 3. Briefl y, in fi ve-membered rings, cis and
_trans couplings are about the same. In four- and three-membered rings, cis couplings are larger_
than trans. But in all cases the absolute values of J go down as the ring gets smaller and the C–H
bonds are ‘spread out’ more. Indeed, you can say that all coupling constants are smaller in
small rings, as we shall see. But we need to examine a few examples in a bit more detail.

###### Three-membered rings


_cis_
chrysanthemic
acid

_trans_
chrysanthemic
acid


Three-membered rings have to be fl at with all bonds eclipsed so the dihedral angle is 0° for cis
Hs and 109° for trans Hs. Looking at the Karplus curve on p. 796, we expect the cis coupling
to be larger, and it is. A good example is chrysanthemic acid, which is part of the pyrethrin
group of insecticides found in the pyrethrum plant. Both cis and trans chrysanthemic acids
are important, and in both isomers the coupling between the green proton on the ring and its
brown neighbour on the double bond is 8 Hz. In the cis compound, the green proton is a triplet so the cis coupling in the ring is also 8 Hz. In the trans compound it is a double doublet
with the second coupling, trans across the ring to the black H, of 5 Hz.
The most important three-membered rings are the epoxides. You saw in Chapter 13
(p. 295) that electronegative atoms reduce coupling constants by withdrawing electron
density from the bonds that transmit the coupling ‘information’. This means that epoxide

couplings are very small—much smaller than those of their closely related alkenes, for
example. Compare the four coupling constants in the diagram: for the epoxide, all couplings are small, but cis coupling is larger than trans coupling. In alkenes, trans coupling is
larger (Chapter 13, p. 293). The table summarizes the coupling constants for alkenes, epoxides, and cyclopropanes.

###### Four-membered rings

A similar situation exists with four-membered rings—the cis coupling is larger than the trans
but they are generally both smaller than those in larger rings. A good example is the amino
acid in the margin, the skeleton of the penicillins. The NMR spectrum contains three 1H
signals in the middle regions. There is a singlet at δH 4.15 ppm that clearly belongs to the
isolated green proton and two doublets at δH 4.55 and 5.40 ppm that must belong to the
black protons. The coupling constant between them is 5 Hz and they are cis-related.
There are now large numbers of β-lactam antibiotics known and one family has the
opposite (trans) stereochemistry around the four-membered ring. The typical member is
thienamycin. We will analyse the spectrum in a moment, but fi rst look at the differences—apart from stereochemistry—between this structure and the last. The sulfur atom
is now outside the fi ve-membered ring, the acid group is on a double bond in the same
ring, and the amino group has gone from the β-lactam to be replaced by a hydroxyalkyl
side chain.
Turning to the spectrum and the key question of stereochemistry, this is what the Merck
discoverers said in their original article: ‘[1]H NMR spectra of thienamycin (and derivatives). . .
show small vicinal coupling constants J ≤ 3 Hz for the two β-lactam hydrogens. Past experience with penicillins. . .shows the _cis relationship of the_ β-lactam hydrogens to be always
associated with the larger coupling.’ As we have just seen penicillins have J ~ 5 Hz for these
hydrogens.
The NMR spectrum of a thienamycin derivative with protecting groups on the amine and
carboxylic acids is shown below. Try your hand at interpreting it before you read the explanation. Your aim is to fi nd the coupling constant across the four-membered ring.

The simple answer is 2.5 Hz. The signals at 3.15 and 4.19 ppm are the protons on the
β-lactam ring and the 9 Hz extra coupling is to the CH2 in the fi ve-membered ring. If you went
into this spectrum in detail you may have been worried about the 12.5 and especially the
18 Hz couplings. These are [2]J (geminal) couplings and we will discuss them in the next section. The full assignment is shown below.

We should emphasize that a coupling constant of 5 or 2.5 Hz in isolation would not allow
us to assign stereochemistry across the four-membered ring but, when we have both, we can
say with confi dence that the larger coupling is between _cis Hs and the smaller coupling_
between trans Hs.

**An example of vicinal coupling in structural analysis: afl atoxins**

We can bring together a lot of these points in the structure of one compound, the dreaded
afl atoxin. Afl atoxins were mentioned in Chapter 19: they occur in moulds, including those
that grow on some foods, and cause liver cancer. These slow-acting poisons are among the most
toxic compounds known. Afl atoxin B1 is an example. The four red protons on saturated carbons in the fi ve-membered ring in the margin appear as two triplets: δH 2.61 (2H, t, J 5 Hz) and
δH 3.42 (2H, t, J 5 Hz). The cis and trans couplings are the same. The yellow proton, on the
junction between the two fi ve-membered cyclic ethers, is a doublet δH 6.89 (1H, d, J 7 Hz).
This is, of course, the cis coupling to the black hydrogen. The black hydrogen has this

**H**

coupling too, but it appears as a doublet of triplets with a triplet coupling of 2.5 Hz: δH 4.81
(1H, dt, J 7, 2.5, 2.5 Hz). These small couplings can only be to the two green hydrogens: the

3J and 4J couplings are indeed the same.
Finally there is another strange coincidence—each green hydrogen appears as a triplet
with 2.5 Hz couplings. Evidently, the cis coupling across the double bond is also 2.5 Hz. We
expect cis coupling in a cyclopentene to be small (it was 4 Hz in the azulene on p. 814), but
not that small—it must be the electronegative oxygen atom that is reducing the value still
further.

###### Geminal ([2]J ) coupling

For coupling to be seen, the two hydrogen atoms in question must have different chemical
shifts—identical protons do not couple. For [2]J, or geminal, couplings the two hydrogen atoms
are on the same carbon atom, so in order to discuss geminal coupling we must fi rst consider
what leads the two hydrogens of a CH2 group to have different shifts.
To introduce the topic, an example. It may seem to you that any six-membered ring might
show different chemical shifts for axial and equatorial groups. But this doesn’t happen.
Consider the result of this Robinson annelation reaction.

The two methyl groups at C4 give rise to a single signal in the [13]C NMR at 27.46 ppm. Even
though one of them is (pseudo)axial and one (pseudo)equatorial, the molecule exists in solution as a rapidly equilibrating mixture of two conformations. The axial green methyl in the
left-hand conformer becomes equatorial in the right-hand conformer, and vice versa for the
black methyl group. The equilibrium position must be 50:50 and fast exchange averages
the chemical shifts of the two methyl groups. The same is true for the CH2 groups around the
back of the ring, which each appear as a triplet.
However, the enone is not the only product of this reaction. A methanol adduct is also
formed by Michael addition of methanol to the conjugated enone. This product has two
methyl signals at 26.1 and 34.7 ppm. If we examine the molecule by conformational analysis
as we did for the fi rst product we see a similar situation.

Similar but not the same. This time, the two conformations are not identical. One has the
OMe group equatorial and the other has it axial. Even the two methyl groups do not entirely
change places in the two conformations. True, the green methyl is axial on the left and equatorial on the right, but it has a gauche (dihedral angle 60°) relationship with the OMe group
in both conformations. The black Me group is gauche to OMe on the left but anti-periplanar
to the OMe group on the right. Averaging the two different conformations, in each of which
the black and green methyl groups are different (that is, they don’t just change places), does
_not lead to equalization of the two methyl groups._
Perhaps a simpler way to discover this is to use a confi gurational, rather than a conformational, diagram. The green methyl group is on the same face of the molecule as the MeO
group, while the black methyl group is on the other face. No amount of ring fl ipping can make
them the same. They are diastereotopic, a term we shall defi ne shortly. And so are all three CH2
groups in the ring. The green Hs are on the same face of the molecule as the MeO group while
the black Hs are on the other face.
A proton NMR example confi rms this, and here is one from an odd source. There are fungi
that live on animal dung, called coprophilous fungi. They produce antifungal compounds,
presumably to fi ght off competition! Anyway, in 1995 two new antifungal compounds were
discovered in a fungus living on lemming dung. They were named coniochaetones A and B
and their structures were deduced with the usual array of mass and NMR spectra. The
proton spectra, run on a 600 MHz machine, are shown below, and they reveal considerable
detail.
Some of the spectrum is essentially the same for the two compounds, but other parts are quite
different. Coniochaetone A has a very simple spectrum, very easily assigned. Coniochaetone B
is rather more interesting. The spectrum is much more complicated, even though it has only
one more C–H (the grey one) than coniochaetone A. The reason is that addition of that H atom
creates a stereogenic centre and makes the top and bottom faces of the molecule different. Each
H in both CH2 groups becomes differentiated from its partner.

The green Hs are coupled to each other (J = 18 Hz) and to each of the black Hs with a different coupling constant. One of the green hydrogens also shows a long-range ([4]J = 1.4 Hz)
W-coupling to the red H. The black Hs are too complex to analyse, even at 600 MHz, but the
different couplings to the red Hs are shown by the signal at 5.43 ppm.

###### The size of the geminal coupling constant

The 18 Hz geminal coupling constant between the green protons of coniochaetone B is large,
but not unusually so for a geminal coupling. A more typical fi gure in a six-membered ring
might be closer to 14 Hz, and we will see shortly why the value in coniochaetone B is bigger
than this. The example below provides an opportunity to examine coupling constants in
another example where NMR was essential for determining the structure. The compound is
pederin, a toxic amide of the blister beetle Paederus fuscipes. After some incorrect early suggestions, the actual structure of the compound was eventually deduced as shown.

We are not going to discuss the full structure elucidation, but will concentrate on the stereochemistry of the right-hand ring. The fi ve (green) protons on the ring gave the signals listed
in the margin.
Three of the protons have shifts δH 3–4, and are obviously on carbons attached to oxygen
atoms. The other two, δH about 2, must be the diastereotopic pair at C5. The coupling of 12 Hz,
which appears in both signals, must be the geminal coupling and the other couplings are found
in the signals at δH 3.75 and 3.85. The signal at δH 3.75 has no other couplings and must be from
C4 so that leaves δH 3.85 for the hydrogen atom at C6, which is also coupled to the hydrogen in

the side chain. The 10 Hz coupling must be axial–axial—the others are all much smaller, meaning there is just the one axial–axial coupling. The left-hand side chain must therefore occupy an
axial position as shown in the margin. This is perhaps a bit surprising—it’s large and branched—
but the molecule has no choice but to place one of the two side chains axial.
One of the most important compounds from the last 25 years is Taxol, the anti-cancer compound isolated from the bark of the Pacifi c yew tree. Taxol’s structure has four rings—with eight,
six (twice), and four members—and is too complex to analyse in detail, but the NMR spectrum
of the closely related compound in the margin gives us the opportunity to illustrate how much
geminal couplings in rings may vary and to analyse some of the factors which control this variation. The coupling between the black Hs is 20 Hz while that between the green Hs is just 6 Hz.
20 Hz is a very large coupling constant, even for geminal coupling, and the reason it is so big
is the adjacent π bond. If a CH2 group is next to an alkene, aromatic ring, C=O group, CN
group, or any other π-bonded functional group, it will have a larger geminal coupling constant. This effect also explains the large 18 Hz coupling in coniochaetone B (p. 819).
But why is the green coupling so small? The reason is the four-membered ring. You saw on
p. 814 that vicinal couplings are small in small rings; the same is true of geminal couplings.
Another factor comes into play here as well—the adjacent oxygen atom. Electronegative
atoms always tend to reduce coupling constants.



- **The size of [2]J and [3]J coupling constants**

**We have now covered all of the important infl uences on the size of coupling constants. They are:**

**•** **dihedral angle: [3]J greatest at 180° and 0°; about 0 Hz at 90°**

**•** **ring size, which leads to ‘spreading out’ of bonds and lower [2]J and lower [3]J in small rings**

**•** **electronegative atoms, which decrease [2]J and [3]J coupling constants between protons**

  - π systems, which increase [2]J coupling constants between protons.

###### Diastereotopic groups

You have now seen several examples where two protons attached to the same carbon are not
the same, and it is time to examine more closely the appearance of these CH2 groups in NMR
spectra. To do this, we shall have to discuss some aspects of symmetry that build on what you
learned in Chapter 14. You will see that there are three possibilities for the symmetry associated with a CH2 group, and these three possibilities have an effect both on the chemistry of
the molecule and on what its NMR spectrum will look like.
First, an example in which the two hydrogens are indeed the same. Although the molecule is
of course achiral, we may draw one hydrogen coming towards us and one going away, but the
two Hs are the same. This is easy to demonstrate. If we colour one H black and one green, and
then rotate the molecule through 180°, the black H appears in the place of the green H and vice
versa. The rotated molecule hasn’t changed because the other two substituents (OMe here) are
also the same.
If we had given out uncoloured models of this molecule with this book, and asked each
reader to paint one H green and one H black, we would have no way at all of giving instructions
about which to paint what colour. But it wouldn’t matter because, even without these instructions, every reader would produce an identical model, whichever way they painted their Hs.
The correct description for this pair of hydrogen atoms is homotopic. They are the same
(homo) topologically and cannot be distinguished by chemical reagents, enzymes, NMR
machines, or human beings.



- **Homotopic groups**

**Homotopic groups cannot be distinguished by any means whatsoever: they are chemically**
**entirely identical.**


**MeO** **Ph**


What happens when the other two substituents are different? At fi rst sight the situation
does not seem to have changed. Surely the two hydrogens are still the same as one another?


-----

In fact, they aren’t—not quite. If we had given out uncoloured models of this molecule and
just said ‘paint one H green and one H black’, we would not have got just one type of model.
However, this time we could give instructions about which H we wanted which colour. To get
the fi rst of these two, we just need to say ‘Take the MeO group in your left hand and the Ph
group in your right, kink the carbon chain upwards. The hydrogen coming towards you is to be
painted black.’ All the models produced by readers would then be identical—as long as the read_ers knew their left from their right. This is a very important point: the green and black hydrogens_
in this molecule (unlike the fi rst one) can be described only in phrases incorporating the words
‘left’ or ‘right’, and are distinguishable only by a system that knows its left from its right.
Human beings are such a system: so are enzymes and the asymmetric reagents you will meet
in Chapter 41. But NMR machines are not. NMR machines cannot distinguish right and left—
the NMR spectra of two enantiomers are identical, for example. There is no question of enantiomers in the molecule in question—it has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Nonetheless, the
relationship between these two hydrogens is rather like the relationship between enantiomers
(the two possible ways of colouring the Hs are enantiomers—mirror images) and so they are
called enantiotopic. Enantiotopic protons appear identical in the NMR spectrum.

- **Enantiotopic groups**

**Enantiotopic groups can be distinguished by systems that can tell right from left, but are still**
**magnetically equivalent and appear identical in the NMR spectrum.**


**H**


**O**


The third situation usually arises when the molecule has a stereogenic centre. As an example
we can take the Michael product from the beginning of this section. It is now very easy to distinguish the two hydrogens on each ring carbon atom and, if we want to give instructions on
how to paint a model of this molecule, we can just say ‘Make all the Hs on the same side of the
ring as OMe green, and the ones on the opposite side to OMe black.’ We do not need to use the
words ‘right’ or ‘left’ in the instructions, and it is not necessary to know your right from your left
to tell the two types of Hs apart. Ordinary chemical reagents and NMR machines can do it. These
Hs are different in the way that diastereoisomers are different and they are diastereotopic. We
expect them to have different chemical shifts in the proton NMR spectrum. The same is true of
the methyl groups: they too are diastereotopic and we expect them to have different shifts.

###### How to tell if protons are homotopic, enantiotopic, or diastereotopic

What we have said so far explains to you why homotopic and enantiotopic groups always
appear identical in the NMR spectrum, but diastereotopic protons may not. Now we will give
a quick guide to determining what sort of pair you are dealing with in a given molecule.
The key is to draw your molecule twice. In each drawing (or model if you prefer) replace one
of the Hs (we’ll assume we’re looking at protons, but the argument works for other groups
too—Me groups, for example) with an imaginary group ‘G’. Write down the fi rst structure you
get, with stereochemistry shown. Next, write down the structure you get by replacing the
other H with the group G. Now the more diffi cult bit: identify the stereochemical relationship
between the two molecules you have drawn.

 - If they are identical molecules, the protons are homotopic.

 - If they are enantiomers, the protons are enantiotopic.

 - If they are diastereoisomers, the protons are diastereotopic.

This is really just a simpler way of doing what we did with black and green above, but it is
easy to do for any molecule. Take the fi rst of our examples, and replace each H in turn by G.
These two molecules are identical because just turning one over gives the other: the protons
are homotopic.



- NMR machines can tell the
difference, but it does not follow
that they will. There are many
examples of protons that are
different but have the same
chemical shift (toluene, PhMe,
shows a singlet in the NMR for
all its aromatic protons even
though they are of three
different kinds). Sometimes
diastereotopic protons have the
same chemical shift, sometimes
slightly different chemical shifts,
and sometimes very different
chemical shifts.

Now for the next example. The two molecules are not identical: to make one into the other
you need to refl ect in the plane of the paper, so they are enantiomers, and the Hs are enantio_topic. There is another term we must introduce you to in relation to this molecule, which will_
become useful in the next chapter, and that is ‘prochiral’. The molecule we started with here
was not chiral—it had a plane of symmetry. But by changing just one of the Hs to a different
group we have made it chiral. Molecules that are achiral but can become chiral through one
simple change are called prochiral.
Now we will choose one of the three pairs of Hs in the cyclohexanone example. The starting
molecule is, of course, now chiral, and the two molecules we get when we replace each H by
G are now diastereoisomers: one has G and OMe anti, the other syn, and the pairs of hydrogens are diastereotopic. The same is true for the other CH2 groups. Furthermore, the methyl
groups attached to the ring will be diastereotopic too, and we expect them to appear as two
3H singlets.

###### Spotting diastereotopic protons in the NMR spectrum

A CH2 group with diastereotopic Hs isolated from any other Hs will give rise to two signals, one
for each H, and they will couple to each other so that the complete signal is a pair of doublets.
A typical geminal ([2]J) coupling constant is 14 Hz—relatively large. Because chemical shift differences (Δδ) between Hs on the same carbon atom tend to be small—usually less than 1 ppm—
the signals have Δδ ~ J and are distorted into a ‘roof-topped’ AB system.
Here is an example. The pheromone frontalin is a remarkable compound used by both
insects and by elephants to attract a mate. Its structure and [1]H NMR spectrum are shown
below.

- The shape of NMR signals
where J and the chemical shift
difference are of the same order
of magnitude were discussed in
Chapter 13. The arguments
apply to any coupled protons of
similar chemical shift—there we
used disubstituted aromatic
rings as the example—but are
particularly relevant here.



- It is not always easy to
decide which proton gives rise to
which signal in a diastereotopic
AB system, although the
information may be important in
assigning stereochemistry. The
size of other couplings, or the
nuclear Overhauser effect
(p. 799), may assist.


5 4 3 2 1 0 ppm

The red and green hydrogens are diastereotopic, and have no other couplings. They give the
pair of doublets at 3.42 and 3.93 ppm., each with J 7 Hz (an AB system) in the [1]H NMR. The
coupling constant here is small for [2]J—only 7 Hz—but that should not surprise you since we
have a fi ve-membered ring and a nearby oxygen atom.
The coupling constant in an AB system is easy to extract—it is the difference in Hz
between the two lines highlighted same colour in the spectrum above. But the chemical
shifts are not so easily measured. The chemical shift of each proton is at the weighted mean
of the two lines—the more distorted the signal, the nearer the chemical shift to that of the
larger inner line.

###### Diastereotopic protons in acyclic compounds

The same principles apply to open-chain compounds, such as amino acids. All of the amino
acids in proteins except glycine are chiral. Glycine has a CH2 group that gives a singlet in the
NMR spectrum as its Hs are enantiotopic. Similarly, the N-benzyl derivative of glycine has a
second CH2 group (NCH2Ph) that gives another singlet in the NMR spectrum as these Hs too
are enantiotopic.

The plane of the paper is a plane of symmetry for both of the CH2 groups of N-benzyl glycine in the way it is drawn here. But for the other amino acids, which are all chiral, the symmetry is different. The [1]H NMR spectrum of N-benzyl alanine is shown below. There is now
no plane of symmetry, so the Hs of the NCH2Ph group are diastereotopic. The CH2 group
appears as an AB pattern.


8.0 7.5 7.0 6.5 6.0


5.5 5.0 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 ppm


In the way in which the molecule is drawn, the green H is on the same side as the Me group
and the brown H on the other. It does not matter that there is free rotation in this molecule—
the two diastereotopic protons are never in the same environment so even after averaging
over all the conformations available to the molecule they always appear at different chemical
shift. If a molecule is chiral, all CH2 groups in that molecule—however fl exible it may be and
however far they are from any chiral centre—are diastereotopic, and can potentially appear
in the spectrum as an AB system.
It is more common to fi nd diastereotopic CH2 groups with neighbours, and an example arises
when aspartic acid is dissolved in D2O with NaOD present. The NH2 protons are exchanged for
deuterium atoms and do not show up in the spectrum—the molecule exists as its dianion.

###### To summarize...

We have covered a lot of ground in this chapter, and have used the huge topic of saturated
heterocycles to explain a lot, not just about the reactivity and conformation of rings. Many
of these explanations involved consideration of the alignment of orbitals—we called these
stereoelectronic effects. The same analysis allowed us to make sense of the NMR spectra, and
in particular the coupling constants, of cyclic molecules, both heterocyclic and carbocyclic.
And by thinking about symmetry in these cyclic molecules we were also able to deduce the
origins of symmetry-related features (such as diastereotopic protons) in the NMR spectra of
acyclic compounds.
The next chapter is the fourth consecutive chapter to take rings as a theme. It will introduce
you to practical ways of controlling stereochemistry in cyclic systems—the fi rst step towards
making molecules with a particular stereochemistry, which will continue in Chapter 33 and
culminate in Chapter 41 on asymmetric synthesis.

###### Introduction

In the last chapter we looked at how the NMR spectra of cyclic molecules tell us a lot about
their shape—both their conformation and their confi guration. We are now going to go
beyond simply studying stereochemistry and start to explain how to control stereochemistry.
We have already, in Chapter 27, spent some time looking at controlling one aspect of stereochemistry—double bond geometry. But stereochemistry is about much more than this, and
in this chapter and the next we will explain how to make single diastereoisomers and single
enantiomers.
We start with stereochemistry in rings. Not only is stereochemistry easier to understand in
cyclic compounds, it is also better behaved in cyclic compounds. Suppose you were to reduce
this ketone to one of the corresponding alcohols.

relative stereochemistry?


To achieve a stereoselective reaction at the new stereogenic centre (shown in black) the
green stereogenic centre would somehow have to infl uence the direction of attack of the
nucleophile on the C=O group. Separated from it by three bonds, in a molecule with a high
degree of fl exibility, makes this a very tall order. A more or less 50:50 mixture of the two diastereoisomers would be expected.

However, if we join up the molecule into a ring, as shown in the margin, things are suddenly
quite different. (This is not, of course, a chemical reaction—just a thought process!) The cyclic
ketone has a fi xed conformation controlled by the determination of the tert-butyl group to be
equatorial. The two faces of the carbonyl group are therefore clearly quite different, and in
fact by careful choice of reducing agent it is possible to attack either at will, giving almost
exclusively either the axial or the equatorial alcohol. As we will explain shortly (p. 828) large
reagents prefer to approach equatorially while small reagents prefer to approach axially, putting the new OH group into an equatorial position. These are stereoselective reactions and,
because the two different outcomes are diastereoisomers, we can call them diastereoselective.

- If your memory of Chapter
16’s discussion of the effect of
substituents on the
conformation of six-membered
rings is dim, you should refresh
it now. Conformational analysis
underpins much of this chapter
and you need to be fully familiar
with its concepts and
terminology.


The key to the difference between these two compounds is in their conformations. The sixmembered ring of the cyclic ketone has one conformation and the two approaches to the faces
of the ketone are very different. In the open-chain compound rotation about all the C–C
bonds is possible and very many conformations will be populated. In any one conformation,
attack on one face of the ketone or the other may happen to be preferred, but summed over all
of them the average selectivity will be close to 1:1. There is all the difference in the world
between cyclic and open-chain compounds when it comes to stereoselective reactions.
In this chapter we shall look at reactions happening to cyclic compounds, reactions with
cyclic intermediates, and reactions with cyclic transition states. We shall investigate what
happens to stereochemistry when two (or even more) rings are joined together at a bond or at
an atom. You have already looked in detail at reactions which close rings (Chapter 31, p. 805),
and many of the reactions in this chapter you will have met earlier in the book. Our task is to
reveal new features and subtleties, and to show you how to use these reactions to control
stereochemistry.

###### Stereochemical control in six-membered rings

As you saw in Chapter 16, cyclohexanes benefi t from very well defi ned conformational preferences. Substituents are orientated either axially or equatorially, and usually prefer the equatorial orientation, especially when they are large. The strong preference for substituents to
adopt the equatorial position means that when diastereoisomeric cyclohexanes equilibrate by
processes such as enolization they may give high selectivity for the all-equatorial compound.
For example, this fi ne perfumery material is made worthless by enolization.

- Although a disadvantage
here, in other cases equilibration

The reason the equilibrium favours the worthless trans isomer (it forms 92% of the equilibrium mixture) is that the two substituents are both in the more stable equatorial positions.

###### Six-membered rings containing one sp[2]-hybridized carbon atom: cyclohexanone

If we’re interested in the reactions of six-membered rings, then we are going to have to consider what happens to their conformation when they contain reactive functional groups such
as carbonyl groups and alkenes—in other words, the effect of introducing sp[2] C atoms into the
ring. For just one sp[2] carbon atom the simple answer is that nothing changes—the conformation is not signifi cantly altered by the presence of just one sp[2] centre in a ring. The conformations of methylenecyclohexene and cyclohexanone are shown below.

**O**

Six-membered rings with more than one sp[2] C atom do lose their chair conformation—they
become fl attened to some degree when there are one or more double bonds included in the
ring and we shall come on to those in the next section.

###### Axial or equatorial attack is possible on a cyclohexanone

So, what happens when a cyclohexanone is attacked by a nucleophile? For cyclohexanone
itself, the reaction below gives a product which can adopt either of the two conformations
shown, with Nu axial or equatorial, depending on the relative size of Nu and OH. This reaction does not tell us much about the attack on the C=O group itself—we can’t tell, for example, whether Nu[−] attacked the axial or the equatorial face of the C=O group.

Now think of a nucleophile attacking 4-t-butylcyclohexanone. Since the t-butyl group locks
the ring (t-Bu can never be axial), whether Nu is axial or equatorial will depend only on which
face of the C=O group it attacks. Attack on the same face as the _t-butyl group leaves the_
nucleophile axial and the hydroxyl group equatorial; attack on the opposite face leaves the
nucleophile equatorial and the hydroxyl group axial. The nucleophile is said to attack either
in an axial or equatorial manner, depending on where it ends up. It’s easier to see this in a
diagram.

Now for an observation—we’ll try and explain it shortly. In general, large nucleophiles
attack equatorially and small nucleophiles attack axially. For example, reduction of 4-t-butylcyclohexanone with lithium aluminium hydride in Et2O gives 90% of the trans alcohol: 90%


-----

of the hydride has added axially. AlH4− is quite small as nucleophiles go: to make more of the
_cis alcohol we need a larger nucleophile—lithium tri-sec-butylborohydride, for example, sold_
under the name of L-selectride[®]. This is so large that it attacks only equatorially, yielding typically 95% of the cis alcohol.

Carbon-centred nucleophiles follow the same trend—the table shows that, as size increases
from the slender ethynyl anion through primary and secondary organometallics to t-BuMgBr,
the axial selectivity drops off correspondingly. PhLi behaves as though it were quite small
because it is fl at.

t-BuMgBr 0 100

Now the diffi cult part—why? This is a question to which the answer really is not known for
certain. It’s certainly true that the direction of approach for axial attack is more hindered
than for equatorial attack, and this is certainly the reason large nucleophiles prefer to attack
equatorially.
But if this is the case, why do small ones actually prefer to attack axially? There must be
another factor that favours axial attack for those nucleophiles small enough to avoid the bad
interactions with the other axial hydrogens. At the transition state, the forming –O[−] oxygen
substituent is moving in either an axial or an equatorial direction. Just as the axial substituent
is less favourable than an equatorial one, so is the transition state leading there, and the route
leading to the equatorial hydroxyl group is favoured.
When chemists made the drug alphaprodine using the reaction shown below, they found
that the combination of the equatorial preference of a methyl group adjacent to C=O and an
equatorial preference for attack on the C=O group were enough to favour the formation of
one diastereoisomer. Here is the reaction, with the starting material and product represented
as a conformational diagram.

In the next reaction, stereoselectivity is not so good. Zeneca (now AstraZeneca) announced
the manufacture of a drug by the addition of a lithiated thiophene to another heterocyclic
ketone, which initially gave a mixture of diastereoisomers.

Such a mixture is no good for manufacture of a pure drug, but the compound can be equilibrated in dilute acid by repeated SN1 formation of a tertiary cation and recapture by water so
that the required product (which is more stable as it has both Me and the thiophene equatorial) dominates by 92:8 and can be purifi ed by crystallization. The unwanted isomer can be
recycled in the next batch.

the equilibration of the

In these reactions the molecule has a free choice whether to place a substituent in an axial
or equatorial position and this is the only consideration because the starting materials in the
reactions—ketones or carbocations—have six-membered rings that are already in the chair
conformation even though they have one trigonal (sp[2]) atom in the ring.

###### Six-membered rings with two or more sp[2] carbons: cyclohexenes

With more than two trigonal carbon atoms in the ring, a cyclohexene can no longer adopt a
chair conformation. At least four of the atoms in the ring must now be in a plane, and the best
way to represent this is in the diagrams shown below. The four atoms in the plane are nearest
you, with the remaining two placed one above and one below that plane.

**H** hydrogens adopt

**H**

Cyclohexene itself fl ips rapidly between these two conformations, with a barrier of about
22 kJ mol[−][1], about half that of cyclohexane. As in cyclohexane, hydrogen atoms on the saturated carbons of the cyclohexene structure adopt two types of positions, but as they are not
quite orientated in the same way as in cyclohexane, we call the two orientations ‘pseudoaxial’
and ‘pseudoequatorial’.

###### Only axial attack is possible with cyclohexenes

These conformations of six-membered rings with more than one trigonal carbon are quite
plainly not chairs, and are much less stable than chairs. Anything which allows them to
become a chair is likely to be highly favoured, and the stereoselectivity of a reaction is likely

to be driven by the need for the transition state and product to have a chair rather than a boat
conformation. This can override the preference for substituents to go into equatorial positions. The choice of axial attack controls the stereoselectivity of reactions of cyclohexenes
(and, as you will see, their epoxides), six-membered cyclic enolates, and six-membered cyclic
enones.

enamine

**H**

Enolate equivalents were
discussed in Chapter 25.

**X**
**_t-Bu_**


To get at the reason for this result we need to look at the conformation of the enamine intermediate. At this point we shall generalize a bit more and write a structure that represents any
enol derivative where X may be OH, O[−], OSiMe3, NR2, and so on. The double bond (2 × sp[2]
centres) in the ring means the conformation is a partially fl attened chair, as described above.
We place the t-butyl group in an equatorial position because, as with cyclohexanes, it is so
bulky it cannot go axial. This means that there is only one conformation to consider—the one
shown in the margin.
Now, the electrophile must attack the π system of this conformation, and to do so it has to
attack from more or less directly above or below because only then can it interact with one of
the lobes of the p orbital at the enol position shown in orange. The need to interact with the
π system is the reason cyclohexenes and related compounds react in an axial direction. The
top of the molecule looks to be more open to attack so we shall try that approach fi rst.


Alkylations of enolates, enamines, and silyl enol ethers of cyclohexanone usually show
substantial preference for axial attack. The enamine of 4-t-butylcyclohexanone, which has a
fi xed conformation because of the t-butyl group, gives 90% axial alkylation and only 10%
equatorial alkylation with n-PrI.

As the electrophile forms a bond to the trigonal carbon atom, that atom must become tetrahedral and it does so by forming a vertical bond upwards. The result is shown in the diagram—the ring turns into a twist-boat conformation. Now, of course, after the reaction is
over, the ring can fl ip into a chair conformation and the new substituent will then be equatorial, but that information is not present in the transition state for the reaction. We could say
that, at the time of reaction, the molecule doesn’t ‘know’ it can later be better off and get the
substituent equatorial: all it sees is the formation of an unstable twist boat with a high-energy
transition state leading to it.
Attack from the apparently more hindered bottom face makes the trigonal carbon atom
turn tetrahedral in the opposite sense by forming a vertical bond to the electrophile down_wards. The ring goes directly to a chair form with the electrophile in the axial position._

When the carbonyl group is restored by hydrolysis (if necessary—with an enolate X is
already O) the ring need not fl ip: it’s already a chair with the t-butyl equatorial, and the new
substituent is axial on the chair. This is the observed product of the reaction.
It’s important that you understand what is going on here. The reagent has to attack from an
axial direction to interact with the p orbital. If it attacks from above, the new substituent is
axial on an unstable twist boat. If it attacks from below, the new substituent is axial on a
chair— granted, this is not as good as equatorial on a chair, but that’s not an option—it has to
be axial on something, and a chair is better than a twist boat. So this is the product that forms.
It’s just hard luck for the substituent that it can’t know that if it did weather it out on the twist
boat it could later get equatorial—it plumps for life on the chair and so has to be content with
ending up axial.
Here is an example with an unsaturated carbonyl compound as an electrophile: the reaction
is a Michael addition. The ketone here is slightly different—it has the t-butyl group in the
3- rather than the 4-position, and the reacting centre becomes quaternary during the Michael
reaction. But the result is still axial attack.

This result is more impressive because the large electrophile ends up on the same side of the
ring as the t-butyl group, so the stereoselectivity cannot be based on any simple idea of reaction on the less hindered side of the ring. It is genuine axial attack, as the conformational
diagram of the product confi rms.
Cyclohexenones are even fl atter than cyclohexenes, but it is convenient to draw them in a
similar conformation. Conjugate addition to the substituted cyclohexenone in the margin
gives the trans product.
This is also axial addition to form a chair directly (rather than a twist boat) with the nucleophile approaching from the bottom. We must draw the ring as a fl attened chair.

The 5-alkyl cyclohexenone that we have chosen as our example gives the best results. The
mechanism suggests that the enolate intermediate is protonated on the top face (axial addition again), although we cannot tell this because the product has no stereogenic centre there.
But, if we carry out a tandem reaction with the enolate trapped by a different electrophile, it
becomes clear that the product is again that of axial attack.

same answer but for the wrong
reason by saying that the
nucleophile approaches from the
less hindered side.

Now thermodynamic control can be brought into play. The position next to the ketone can

These alcohols can be separated (they are, of course, diastereoisomers and not enantiomers)
and the major, all-equatorial, one is the useful one. This is an impressive example of conformational control by thermodynamic and by kinetic means originating only from a distant
methyl group in a six-membered ring.

###### Reactions on small rings

The conformational principles which apply to rings other than six-membered ones are rather
more sketchy because only six-membered rings adopt well-defi ned chair (or, for cyclohexenes,
half-chair) conformations. But we can still give you some general guidelines and principles,
and illustrate them with some important examples. We will look in detail at four- and fi vemembered rings.


-----

###### Four-membered rings can be fl at

Saturated four-membered rings have a slightly bent conformation but four-membered lactones are fl at. The enolates of these lactones can be made in the usual way with LDA at –78 °C
and are stable at that temperature, and they react with electrophiles just as you saw in Chapter
25. If the β-lactone has a substituent already then there may be a choice as to which face of
the enolate is attacked by an electrophile. In the example below, simple alkylation with a
variety of alkyl halides gives essentially only one diastereoisomer of the product.

The enolate, as we have seen, is planar, and the phenyl group is in the plane (which is why
it doesn’t matter which of the two possible diastereoisomers of the starting material is used).
The isopropyl group is the only thing out of the plane. The electrophile simply adds to the face
of the enolate not blocked by the isopropyl group. This is a very simple case of a diastereoselective reaction.

###### Lactone enolates

This lithium enolate works well even though it might be expected to be unstable because of a simple elimination reaction.
In general, it is not possible to make open-chain lithium enolates with β oxygen substituents like this because they do
undergo elimination.

But, in the four-membered ring, the p orbitals of the enolate and the C–O single bond are orthogonal (see diagram
below) so that no interaction between them, and no elimination, can occur. In the terminology of Baldwin’s rules
(Chapter 31, p. 810) it would be a disfavoured 4-endo-trig reaction.

Reduction of substituted four-membered ring ketones is usually reasonably stereoselective. If
the substituent is in the 3-position and small reagents like NaBH4 are used, the cis isomer is
favoured. Like saturated four-membered rings, cyclobutanones are slightly puckered to reduce
eclipsing interactions between hydrogen atoms on adjacent carbon atoms, but attack of the
reducing agent still occurs from the direction away from the other substituent to give the cis
product.


###### Diastereoselective reactions of racemic compounds

The stereoselectivity we are
discussing in this chapter is
diastereoselectivity: we are not
concerned with enantiomers and
all of our discussions are equally
valid whether the starting materials are racemic or enantiomerically pure. The product here, as
in many other examples in the
chapter, is racemic so we could
write (±) underneath the structure. In this particular reaction,
the starting material can be
either of two diastereoisomers,
but one of its chiral centres is
lost on formation of the enolate.

###### Five-membered ketones are fl exible

A saturated fi ve-membered ring has a conformation often called an ‘envelope’. It looks a bit
like an opened envelope with one atom at the point of the fl ap. The arrangement closely
matches what you get if you cut one atom out of a cyclohexane ring. At any one moment, one
of the carbon atoms is at the point of the envelope but rapid ring fl ipping equilibrates all these
conformers so that all fi ve atoms are, on average, the same.
Substituted cyclopentanes can have substituents in pseudoaxial or pseudoequatorial positions (in other words, they are somewhat like the axial and equatorial positions in a cyclohexane), but rapid equilibration means that overall we have a very fl exible and labile system.
As a result, reduction of 2-substituted cyclopentanones may not be very stereoselective. What
selectivity there is (about 3:1) in the reduction of 2-methylpentanone with LiAlH4 favours
pseudoaxial attack in the conformation drawn, as is reasonable for a small nucleophile.


pseudo- LiAlH4 **77%** 23%
equatorial attack

LiBH(s-Bu)3 1.5% **98.5%**

The use of a much more bulky reducing agent such as LiBH(s-Bu)3 dramatically reverses and
increases the stereoselectivity. Essentially only the cis compound is formed.

###### Regard fi ve-membered rings with two or more sp[3] carbons as fl at

When there are two or three trigonal carbons in the ring, the ring is fl atter and reactions such
as enolate alkylation and conjugate addition give excellent stereoselectivity even with a simple cyclopentane ring. Unsaturated fi ve-membered lactones (known as ‘butenolides’) give a
very clear illustration of stereochemically controlled conjugate addition. There is only one
possible stereogenic centre and the ring is almost planar so we expect nucleophilic attack to
occur from the less hindered face. Cuprates are good nucleophiles for this reaction and here
Me2CuLi adds to the unsaturated lactone.

- This would be a good point
at which to remind you of what
we stressed in Chapter 14. If all
the starting materials and
reagents are achiral or racemic
the products must be too. That
has been the case in many of
the reactions so far in this
chapter: we haven’t put in (±)
under every compound but we
could have done. But here we
do have a single enantiomer of
starting material so we get a
single enantiomer of product.
Diastereoselectivity is the same
whether the starting material is
enantiomerically pure or
racemic.


It is not even necessary to have a stereogenic centre in an unsaturated ring if we want to
create stereochemistry. A tandem conjugate addition and alkylation creates two new stereogenic centres in one operation. The conjugate addition of a lithium cuprate makes a lithium
enolate, which will react in turn with an alkyl halide. The product is usually trans.

The key step is the alkylation of the enolate intermediate. Enolates in fi ve-membered rings
are almost fl at and the incoming orange allyl bromide prefers the less hindered face away from
the recently added green vinyl group.
Our main example of enolate reactions in fi ve-membered rings is one of some general
importance. It illustrates how stereochemical information can be transmitted across a ring
even though the original source of that information may be lost during the reaction. That
may sound mysterious, but all will become clear. The fi rst reaction is to make a fi ve-membered
cyclic acetal from an optically active hydroxy-acid. Our example shows (S)-(+)-mandelic acid
reacting with t-BuCHO.



- The conjugate addition forms
a lithium enolate
regiospecifi cally, and that was
why you met this sequence in
Chapter 25. We showed you a
dramatic use of the
stereoselectivity there as well, in
a synthesis of a prostaglandin
(p. 604).

- Check that you can write the
mechanisms for acetal formation
(Chapter 11). Acetal formation
is under thermodynamic control
so the product produced is the
more stable.


Acetal formation involves nucleophilic attack of the OH group on the aldehyde so there is
no change at the stereogenic centre. The stereochemistry of the new (acetal) centre may surprise you—why should the cis isomer be so favoured? This is a conformational effect as both
substituents can occupy pseudoequatorial positions.
Now, if we make the lithium enolate with LDA, the original stereogenic centre is destroyed
as that carbon becomes trigonal and planar. The only stereogenic centre left is the newly
introduced one at the acetal position.

If the acetal is now hydrolysed, the new stereogenic centre is revealed as an alkylated version
of the starting material. It may appear that the alkylation has happened stereospecifi cally
with retention, but what has really happened is that the new stereogenic centre in the acetal
intermediate has relayed the stereochemical information through the reaction.
Five-membered rings also allow us to explore electrophilic attack on alkenes. A simple
4-substituted cyclopentene has two different faces—one on the same side as the substituent
and one on the opposite side. Epoxidation with a peroxy-acid occurs preferentially on the less
hindered face.

In the transition state (marked ‡) the peroxyacid prefers to be well away from R, even if R is
only a methyl group (the selectivity is 76:24 with R=Me).
The opposite stereoselectivity can be achieved by bromination in water. The bromonium
ion intermediate is formed stereoselectively on the less hindered side and the water is forced
to attack stereospecifi cally in an SN2 reaction from the more hindered side.

Treatment of the product with base (NaOH) gives an epoxide by another SN2 reaction in

###### Regiochemical control in cyclohexene epoxides

The two reactions above illustrate two important ways of making an epoxide. We are now
going to look in a little more detail at what happens when epoxides are opened—a reaction
that is essentially the reverse of the epoxide-closing reaction you have just seen. Here are both
reactions with the epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring:

Epoxides can be formed from compounds containing an adjacent hydroxyl group and a leaving group by treatment with base. The epoxide formation is an intramolecular SN2 reaction,
and as with any SN2 substitution, inter- or intramolecular, the incoming nucleophile must still
attack into the σ* orbital of the leaving group. And the only way that can happen, as you can
see from the diagrams below, is (a) if the hydroxyl group and leaving group are trans to one
another and (b) if the hydroxyl group and leaving group are both orientated axially. For the
_trans diastereoisomer, the groups can of course adopt either a diequatorial or a diaxial arrange-_


-----

ment (the diequatorial arrangement is favoured, as you saw in Chapter 16) but only the diaxial
can react. The cis diastereoisomer cannot form an epoxide.



- In Chapter 36 you will meet

to force cis substituted
compounds like these to react.

How should we draw this epoxide fused to a six-membered ring? It is impossible for the CO
bonds of the product epoxide ring to adopt perfectly axial and equatorial positions. If you
make a model of cyclohexene oxide (as we can call this epoxide) you will see that the ring is a
slightly deformed chair—in fact it is like the half-chair conformation of cyclohexene, in which
four of the carbon atoms are in the same plane (you met this on p. 829).

model of cyclohexene oxide

The usual way of drawing cyclohexene oxide is shown below: the distortion due to the
three-membered ring changes the orientation of the axial and equatorial hydrogens next to
the ring—they are pseudoaxial and pseudoequatorial. The hydrogens on the back of the
ring (this part of the ring remains about the same as in the chair conformation) can be still
considered as ‘normal’ axial and equatorial hydrogens.

You saw above that the epoxide-forming reaction is essentially the reverse of the epoxideopening reaction. If we took a snapshot of the transition state for either reaction, we would
not be able to tell whether it was the RO[−] that was attacking the C–X σ* orbital to form the
epoxide with X[−] as a leaving group, or a nucleophile X[−] attacking the C–O σ* orbital of the
epoxide to form a ring-opened alcohol. In other words, the transition state is the same for
both reactions.

this transition state is the same for both

Since ring closure is possible only when the starting material is diaxially substituted, this
has to mean that ring opening is similarly possible only if the product is diaxial. This is a general principle: _ring opening of cyclohexene oxides always leads directly to diaxial products. The_
diaxially substituted product may then subsequently fl ip to the diequatorial one, but it is
always the one that is initially formed.

How do we know this to be true? If the ring bears a bulky substituent, ring fl ipping is impossible and the diaxial product has to stay diaxial. An example is nucleophilic attack of halide
on the two epoxides shown below. The fact that the ring is a piperidine, rather than a cyclohexane, does not matter. The equatorial phenyl group fi xes the conformation, and the regiochemistry of the epoxide opening with azide depends only on the relative stereochemistry of
the starting material.

Points to note:

- The nucleophile must attack from the opposite side of the epoxide, allowing it to put
electrons into the C–O σ* orbital. This means that the nucleophile and hydroxyl
group always end up trans in the product.

- The phenyl group locks the conformation of the epoxide. It stays equatorial, so we
only have one epoxide conformation to consider in each case.

- In each case the epoxide opens only at the end that gives the diaxially substituted
chair. Ring opening at the other end would still give a diaxially substituted product,
but it is a diaxially substituted high-energy twist-boat conformation. The twist boat
can, in fact, fl ip to give an all-equatorial product, but in a kinetically controlled

process such as this, it is the barrier to reaction that matters, not the stability of the

ring opening the wrong way would give a twist even though it could ring flip to the stable allboat, which is too high in energy to form equatorial chair if it got the chance



- **Some general observations on stereo- and regioselectivity in six-membered rings:**

**•** **Six–membered rings which are not already a chair (such as cyclohexenes and cyclohexene**
**oxides) react in such a way that they immediately become a chair.**

**•** **They do so by reacting from an axial direction: this may also dictate the regioselectivity of**
**the reaction.**

**•** **Six-membered rings which are chairs already (such as cyclohexanones) remain a chair, and**
**react from either the axial or equatorial direction according to the size of the attacking**
**reagent.**


###### Stereoselectivity in bicyclic compounds

We have just looked at the way the reactivity of an epoxide gains additional subtleties when
it is fused into a bicyclic structure with a six-membered ring. We’re now going to look more
generally at bicyclic compounds and their reactivity, and consider some features of their
stereo selective reactions.

###### Bridged bicyclic rings

There are broadly three kinds of bicyclic compounds. If we imagine adding a second fi vemembered ring to one already there, we could do this in a bridged, fused, or spiro fashion, as
you see in the margin. Bridged bicyclic compounds are just what the name implies—a bridge
of atom(s) is thrown across from one side of the ring to the other. Fused bicyclic compounds
have one bond common to both rings, while spiro compounds have one atom common to both
rings.
You will notice that these three types of bicyclic compounds with fi ve-membered rings
have different numbers of atoms added to a ‘parent’ fi ve-membered ring. The bridged compound has two extra atoms, the fused compound three, and the spiro compound four.
These are marked in green with the original fi ve-membered ring in red. We shall consider
stereoselectivity in each of these types of bicyclic ring systems, starting with bridged
structures.
The bridged ring shown in the margin is known as norbornane: it’s a simple but very important skeleton on which many other structures are based, and it’s worth spending a moment
learning how to draw it convincingly. The instructions in the box overleaf tell you how!
Another way of looking at norbornane is as a six-membered ring held in a boat conformation
by a one-carbon bridge. The bridge has to be axial at both bridgehead positions (or it wouldn’t
be able to form a ring) so the cyclohexane has no choice but to be a boat.


###### Naming bicyclic compounds

As usual we shall not spend too
long on nomenclature, but you
may hear norbornane structures
referred to as ‘bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes’. The ‘bicyclo’ and ‘heptane’ parts are self explanatory.
The numbers (always separated
by dots) refer to the lengths of
the bridges linking the two
bridgehead carbons. The other
two compounds in the margin
above are thus bicyclo[3.3.0]
octane and spiro[4.4]nonane.

A selection of important bridged bicyclic compounds is shown in the margin. Bridged
structures (sometimes called cage structures) are generally very rigid, spending most of
their time in a single, well-defi ned conformation, and this rigidity is refl ected in the stereochemistry of their reactions. For example, attack on norbornanone occurs predominantly
from the side of the one-atom bridge (the green arrow) rather than the two-atom bridge (the
orange arrow).

The two methyl groups on the bridge of the camphor molecule are key features in stereoselective reactions—take them away and the result often changes dramatically. This bi cyclic
system, with and without methyl groups, has been so widely used to establish stereochemical principles that the two faces of, say, the ketone group in camphor, or the C=C double
bond in norbornene (the alkene derivative of norbornane) have been given the names endo
and exo. These refer to inside (endo) and outside (exo) the boat-shaped six-membered ring
shown in black. In general, reactions of norbornane-type structures occur from the less
hindered exo face, but the methyl groups of camphor reverse this selectivity to favour endo
attack:

In a similar style, epoxidation of the two alkenes is totally stereoselective, occurring exo in

would be remarkable in a simple monocyclic compound, but in a rigid bridged bicyclic structure they are almost to be expected.

###### Reactions that break open bridged molecules can preserve stereochemistry

Some powerful oxidizing agents are able to cleave C–C bonds. Oxidation of camphor with
concentrated nitric acid cleaves a C–C bond adjacent to the C=O group and produces a diacid
known as camphoric acid. The usual reagent is nitric acid (HNO3) and oxidation goes via camphor’s enol.


This is an unusual reaction;
more common is cleavage of C=C
bonds with ozone, as you saw in
Chapter 19.

Because the bridge holds the molecule in a fi xed conformation, the cleaved diacid has to
have a specifi c stereochemistry. There is no change at the stereogenic centres, so the reaction
must give retention of confi guration. We can confi dently write the structure of camphoric
acid with cis-CO2H groups, but any doubt is dispelled by the ability of camphoric acid to form
a bridged bicyclic anhydride.

###### Fused bicyclic compounds

 trans-Fused rings

The ring junction of a fused 6,5-membered ring system can have _cis or_ _trans stereo-_
chemistry, and so can any pair of larger rings. For smaller rings, trans 5,5- and 6,4-ring
junctions can be made, with diffi culty, but with smaller rings _trans ring junctions are_
essentially impossible.

The _trans-fused 6,6 systems—trans-decalins—have been very widely studied because_
they form an important part of the structure of steroids. Their conformation was discussed in Chapter 16: they prefer a _trans ring junction as_ _trans-decalins have all-chair_
structures with every bond staggered from every other bond. We can show this by giving
a 6,6 system the choice: reducing this enone with lithium metal gives a lithium enolate
(Chapter 25). Protonation of this anion with the solvent (liquid ammonia) gives a trans
ring junction.

Almost any _cis-fused junction from 3,3 upwards can be made. Even bicyclo[1.1.0]butane_
exists, although it is not very stable. cis-Fused 4,5, 4,6, and 5,5 systems are common and are
much more stable than their trans isomers.
Any method of making such bicyclic compounds will therefore automatically form this
stereochemistry. Consider this hydrogenation:

You met catalytic
hydrogenation in Chapter 23. For a
reminder of what stereoselective
and stereospecifi c mean, see
p. 396.


The two new hydrogen atoms (shown in black) must, of course, add cis to one another: this
is a consequence of the stereospecifi city of the reaction. What is interesting is that they have
also added cis to the green hydrogen atom that was already there. This approach does give the
more stable cis ring junction but the stereochemistry really arises because the other ring hinders approach to the other face of the alkene. Think of it in the way illustrated below: the
alkene has two different faces. On one side there is the green hydrogen atom, and on the other
the orange parts of the second ring. To get hydrogenated, the alkene must lie more or less fl at
on the catalyst surface and that is easier on the top face as drawn.

You can think of cis-fused rings as looking like a butterfl y or an open book. The key to stereoselectivity in their reactions is that everything happens on the outside (on the cover of the
book—the exo face). Nucleophiles add to carbonyl groups from the outside, enolates react with
alkyl halides or Michael acceptors on the outside, and alkenes react with peroxyacids on the

outside. Notice that this means the same side as the substituents at the ring junction. The rings
are folded away from these ring-junction substituents, which that are also on the outside.

A real example comes in the acylation (Chapter 26) of the enolate from the keto-acetal below.
The molecule is folded downwards and the enolate is essentially planar, so the outside face is the
top face as drawn. Addition presumably occurs entirely from the outside, although the fi nal
stereochemistry of the product is controlled thermodynamically because of reversible enolization of the product, allowing the black ester group to adopt the less hindered outside position.

Reduction of the ketone product also occurs exclusively from the outside and this has the surprising effect of pushing the new OH group into the inside position. Attack from the inside is
very hindered in this molecule because one of the acetal oxygen atoms is right on the fl ight path.

The important metabolite biotin has a cis bicyclic structure in which an alkyl chain lies on
the more hindered face of the molecule, and any successful synthesis has to address this particular problem. You saw in Chapter 27 that sulfur stabilizes an adjacent anion, but the direct
alkylation of the sulfi de below is no good because the new alkyl group will go exo. Instead, the
sulfi de was oxidized to a sulfoxide from the exo face, giving an 8:1 ratio of exo:endo sulfoxides.
Alkylation of the cyclic sulfoxide results in trans stereochemistry between the new alkyl group
and the sulfoxide oxygen atom, forcing formation of the desired (endo) product. The synthesis
is diastereoselective—but not enantioselective since there is no way of distinguishing the left
and right sides of the symmetrical sulfoxide.

Epoxidation is stereospecifi c and cis—both new C–O bonds have to be on the same face of
the old alkene. But Chapter 19 introduced you to several electrophilic additions to alkenes
that were stereospecifi c and trans, many of them proceeding through a bromonium ion. If
stereospecifi c trans addition occurs on a cis-fused bicyclic alkene, the electrophile will fi rst
add to the outside of the molecule, meaning the nucleophile will then be forced to add from
the inside. A telling example occurs when the 5,4 fused unsaturated ketone below is treated
with N-bromoacetamide in water.

The bromonium ion is formed on the outside of the rigid structure and the water is then
forced to add from the inside to get trans addition. As well as exhibiting stereospecifi city (trans
addition) and stereoselectivity (bromonium forms on outside), this reaction also exhibits
regio selectivity in the attack of water on the bromonium ion. Water must come from inside,
and it attacks the less hindered end of the bromonium ion.

After protection of the OH group, treatment with base closes a three-membered ring to give
a remarkably strained molecule. The ketone forms an enolate and the enolate attacks the alkyl
bromide intramolecularly to close the third ring. This enolate is in just the right position to
attack the C–Br bond from the back, precisely because of the folding of the molecule.

Only the outside ester—on the same side as the ring junction hydrogens—is hydrolysed. In
the mechanism for ester hydrolysis, the rate-determining step is the attack by the hydroxide
ion so the functional group increases in size in the rate-determining step. This will be much
easier for the ester in the outside than for the one inside the half-open book.

The end result is again that the larger of the two groups is on the inside! There are other ways

group? The new enolate will be fl at and the stereochemistry at the enolate carbon will be lost.

###### Reactions of cis-decalins

You saw in Chapter 16 that while trans-decalins are rigid, cis-decalins can fl ip rapidly between
two all-chair conformations. During the fl ip, all substituents change their conformation. The
substituent R is axial on ring B in the fi rst conformation of cis-decalin shown below but equatorial in the second. The ring junction Hs are always axial on one ring and equatorial on the
other. The green hydrogen is equatorial on ring A and axial on ring B in the fi rst conformation
and vice versa in the second. Of course, they are cis in both. Because R gets equatorial, the
second conformation is preferred in this case.

A standard reaction that gives substituted decalins is the Robinson annelation
(Chapter 26). A Robinson annelation product available in quantity is the keto-enone known
sometimes as the **Wieland–Miescher ketone and used widely in steroid synthesis. The**

If either of these products is reduced with hydrogen and a Pd catalyst (the alcohol is fi rst
made into a tosylate), the _cis-decalin is formed because the enone, although fl attened, is_
already folded to some extent. A conformational drawing of either molecule shows that the
top surface is better able to bind to the fl at surface of the catalyst.

Each of these products shows interesting stereoselective reactions. The ketal can be converted into an alkene by Grignard addition and E1 elimination, and then epoxidized.

Treatment of the other product, the keto-tosylate, with base leads to an intramolecular

A similar reaction happens on the epoxide to produce a beautiful cage structure. This time
it is a fi ve-membered ring that is formed, but the principle is the same—the molecule closes
across the fold rather easily. The new stereogenic centres can only be formed with this confi guration: no other stereoisomer would be a feasible structure.

###### Spirocyclic compounds

Spirocyclic rings meet at one single atom. This means that the two rings are orthogonal about
the tetrahedral atom that is common to both. Even symmetrical-looking versions are unexpectedly chiral. The compound in the margin, for example, is not superimposable on its
mirror image, and its symmetry is similar to that of an allene (see Chapter 14).
These sorts of compounds may look rather diffi cult to come by, but some simple ones are readily made. Cyclization of this keto-acid with polyphosphoric acid leads to a spirocyclic diketone.
The spiro compound is formed because the more substituted enol is preferred in acid solution.

It is much more diffi cult to pass stereochemical information from one ring to the other in
spirocyclic compounds because of the orthogonality of the rings. Still, some reactions are
surprisingly stereoselective—one such is the reduction of the spirocyclic diketone that we
made a moment ago. Treatment with LiAlH4 gives one diastereoisomer of the spirocyclic diol.

The diol can be resolved and used to make the very simple spiro-diene as a single enantiomer. The diene is chiral even though it has no chiral centre because it does not have a plane
of symmetry.

###### Reactions with cyclic intermediates or cyclic transition states

Rings are so good at controlling stereochemistry (as you have seen) that it’s well worth introducing them where they are not really necessary in the fi nal product, simply in order to enjoy
those high levels of stereochemical control. In the rest of this chapter we shall consider the
use of temporary rings in stereochemical control: these might be cyclic intermediates in a
synthetic pathway, or cyclic reaction intermediates, or even merely cyclic transition states. All
aid good stereocontrol. We shall concentrate on examples where the ring reverses the normal
stereoselectivity so that some different result is possible.

###### Tethered functional groups can reach only one side of the molecule

The proverbial donkey starved to death in the fi eld with two heaps of hay because it could not
decide which one to go for fi rst. If the donkey had been tethered to a stake near one heap it
would have been able to reach that heap alone and it could have feasted happily.
This principle can be applied to molecules. If a nucleophile is joined to the group it is to
attack by a short chain of covalent bonds, it may be able to reach only one side. We can illustrate this idea with a reaction you met in Chapter 24: iodolactonization. To remind you,
iodolactonization involves treating a non-conjugated unsaturated acid with iodine in aqueous NaHCO3. The product is an iodolactone.



- In Chapter 14 we explained
that planes of symmetry, not
chiral centres, are the things to
look for when deciding whether
or a not a compound is chiral.

The starting acid contains an E alkene, giving a trans iodonium ion. Inversion occurs in the
attack of the carboxylate anion on the iodonium ion and we have shown this by bringing
the nucleophile in at 180° to the leaving group, with both bonds in the plane of the paper.
A single diastereoisomer of the iodolactone results from a stereospecifi c reaction.
Things get more interesting again when the starting material is cyclic. The iodolactonization below gives only one diastereoisomer.

The relationship between the two stereogenic centres on the old alkene is not an issue—
inversion during opening of the iodonium ion means that the I and the O must lie trans. But
during the cyclization the carboxylic acid can attack only the nearer side of what was the
double bond—in other words the bridge in black has no choice but to be cis across the red sixmembered ring. The reason for this is that, while formation of the iodonium ion is reversible,
only the iodonium ion with the I and CO2H groups trans to each other can cyclize. Tethering
the nucleophilic CO2H group to the alkene dictates the stereochemistry of the product.

This reaction can be used to solve a general problem in the synthesis of steroids: the construction of a diketone with trans-fused 6,5 rings and a quaternary carbon atom at the ring
junction. One solution to this problem uses the lactone just made.
The lactone makes a good temporary tether because it can be hydrolysed or reduced to break
the ring at the C–O bond and reveal new stereogenic centres on the old structure. In this
sequence the lactone ring controls all the subsequent stereochemistry of the molecule in two
ways: it fi xes the conformation rigidly in one chair form—hence forcing the iodide to be
axial—and it blocks one face of the ring. From the lactone above, an alkene is introduced by
E2 reaction on the iodide. This stereospecifi c reaction requires an anti-periplanar H atom so
it has to take the only available neighbouring axial hydrogen atom, shown in green. The
brown and orange hydrogens are not anti-periplanar and anyway elimination with the brown
one would produce a bridgehead alkene.

Now the epoxide is opened with HBr. Only the trans diaxial opening product is possible, so

The protecting silyl group is removed in acid, ready for the next important reaction: a
Michael addition requiring the alcohol to be oxidized to a ketone. Allylic (or benzylic) alcohols can be oxidized by manganese dioxide, and with three atoms now trigonal the ring
becomes even further fl attened. But-3-enyl Grignard reagent is added with Cu(I) catalysis to
make sure that conjugate addition occurs. Conjugate addition normally gives the axial product, as we saw earlier, and fortunately this is not the direction blocked by the bridge.

The last stages are shown below. The ketone is protected, and the alkene oxidized to a carbonyl group by ozonolysis (Chapter 19). The diester can be cyclized by a Claisen ester condensation (Chapter 26). The stereogenic centres in the ring are not affected by any of these
reactions so a trans ring junction must result from this reaction. After ester hydrolysis, HCl
decarboxylates the product and removes the protecting group.



- This may look like a new
reaction but think back to the
Reformatsky reaction (Chapter
26, p 631). Both form zinc

compounds with adjacent
leaving groups.

It is not easy to set up a trans-fused 5,6 system. In this sequence the molecule is effectively

###### Cyclic transition states can reverse normal stereoselectivity

Formation of a ring in an intermediate is a means of enforcing a certain stereochemistry—the
example you have seen made use of a lactone. But even transient formation of a ring in a cyclic
transition state can be enough to control stereochemistry highly effectively. You will see further examples in the next chapter, but here we just present one type of reaction with this
property: epoxidation.
Of course epoxidation reactions form rings, and you have seen examples of epoxidations
with m-CPBA even in this chapter (p. 848) of alkenes such as cyclohexene. We pointed out in
Chapter 19 that epoxidation is stereospecifi c because both new C–O bonds form to the same
face of the alkene.
If we block one face of the ring with a substituent—even quite a small one, such as an acetate
group—epoxidation becomes stereoselective for the face anti to the substituent already there.

**R**

But there is one important exception to this rule, when the substituent is a hydroxyl group.
When an allylic alcohol is epoxidized, the peroxy-acid attacks the face of the alkene syn to the
hydroxyl group, even when that face is more crowded. For cyclohexenol the ratio of syn epoxide to anti epoxide is 24:1 with m-CPBA and it rises to 50:1 with CF3CO3H.

**H**

The reason is shown in the transition state: the OH group can hydrogen bond, through the
H of the alcohol, to the peroxy-acid, stabilizing the transition state when the epoxidation is
occurring _syn. This hydrogen bond means that peroxy-acid epoxidations of alkenes with_
adjacent hydroxyl groups are much faster than epoxidations of simple alkenes, even when
no stereochemistry is involved.
Peroxy-acids work for epoxidizing allylic alcohols syn to the OH group, but another reagent
is better when the OH group is further from the alkene. 4-Hydroxycyclopentene, for example,
can be converted into either diastereomer of the epoxide. If the alcohol is protected with a
large group such as TBDMS (t-butyl-dimethylsilyl), it becomes a simple blocking group and
the epoxide is formed on the opposite face of the alkene. The selectivity is reasonable (83:17)
given that the blocking group is quite distant. But if the OH group is not blocked at all but left
free, and the epoxidation reagent is the vanadium complex VO(acac)2 combined with
_t-BuOOH, the syn epoxide is formed instead. The vanadyl group chelates reagent and alcohol,_
and delivers the reactive oxygen atom to the same face of the alkene as shown.

In both epoxidation examples, the stereoselectivity is due to the cyclic nature of the transition state: the fact that there is a hydrogen bond or O–metal bond ‘delivering’ the reagent to
one face of the alkene. Effectively we have moved on from the tethered nucleophiles of the last
section to (transiently) tethered reagents. This is a very important concept, and we revisit it in
the next chapter: cyclic transition states are the key to getting good stereoselectivity in reactions of acyclic compounds.

###### To summarize...

Diastereoselectivity in rings generally follows a few simple principles:

 - Flattened three-, four-, or fi ve-membered rings, especially ones with two or more
trigonal carbons in the ring, are generally attacked from the less hindered face.

 - Flattened six-membered rings with two or more trigonal carbons in the ring (that is,
which are not already a chair—so six-membered rings with one trigonal C atom don’t
count here) react in such a way that the product becomes an axially substituted chair.

 - Bicyclic compounds react on the outside face.

 - Reaction on the more hindered face can be encouraged by: (1) tethered nucleophiles
or (2) cyclic transition states (tethered reagents).

Diastereoselectivity in compounds without rings is different: it is less well controlled
because there are many more conformations available to the molecule. But even in acyclic
compounds rings can still be important, and some of the best diastereoselectivities arise when
there is a ring formed temporarily in the transition state of the reaction. With or without
cyclic transition states, in some cases we have good prospects of predicting which diastereoisomer will be the major reaction product, or explaining the diastereoselectivity if we already
know this. That is the subject of the next chapter.

allylic alcohol is extremely

###### Looking back

You have had two chapters in a row about stereochemistry: this is the third, and it is time for
us to bring together some ideas from earlier in the book. We aim fi rstly to help you grasp some
important general concepts and secondly to introduce some principles in connection with
stereoselective reactions in acyclic systems. But, fi rst, some revision.
We introduced the stereochemistry of structures in Chapter 14. We told you about two
types of stereoisomers.



- **Enantiomers and diastereoisomers**

**•** **Enantiomers—stereoisomers that are mirror images of one another.**

**•** **Diastereoisomers—stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another.**


In this chapter we shall talk about how to make compounds as single _diastereoisomers._
Making single enantiomers is treated in Chapter 41. Chapter 32 was also about making single
diastereoisomers, and we hope that, having read that chapter, you are used to thinking stereochemically. We shall meet two different ways of making single diastereoisomers.



- **Reactions that make single diastereoisomers**

**•** **Stereospecifi c reactions—reactions where the mechanism means that the stereochemistry**
**of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product and there is no**
**choice involved.**

**•** **Stereoselective reactions—reactions where one stereoisomer of product is formed**
**predominantly because the reaction has a choice of pathways, and one pathway is more**
**favourable than the other.**

These terms were introduced in Chapter 17 in connection with elimination reactions, and
many of the reactions we mention will be familiar from earlier chapters (particularly Chapters
15–19, 25, and 26). A common misapprehension is that stereospecifi c means merely very
stereoselective. It doesn’t—the two terms describe quite different properties of the stereochemistry of a reaction. For the purposes of making a single diastereoisomer, you can think
of stereospecifi c reactions as ones which simply exchange different forms of stereochemical
‘currency’ (double bond geometry and three-dimensional relative stereochemistry, for example) while stereoselective reactions create additional new stereochemical value.

###### Making single diastereoisomers using stereospecifi c reactions of alkenes

The essence of the defi nition we have just stated is much easier to grasp with some familiar
examples. Here are two.

 - SN2 reactions are stereospecifi c: they proceed with inversion so that the absolute
stereochemistry of the starting material determines the absolute stereochemistry of
the product.


**H** **OTs** **Bu4N** **AcO** **AcO** **H**

**DMF**
**_S_** **_R_**


**TsO** **H** **Bu4N** **AcO** **H** **OAc**

- E2 reactions are stereospecifi c: they proceed through an anti-periplanar transition
state, with the relative stereochemistry of the starting material determining the
geometry of the product.

**NaOH**


**Br**


Both of these examples are interesting because they show how, once we have some stereochemistry in a molecule, we can change the functional groups but keep the stereochemistry—
this is the essence of a stereospecifi c reaction. In the second example, we change the bromide
to a double bond, but we keep the stereochemistry (or ‘stereochemical information’) because
the geometry of the double bond tells us which bromide we started with.
This is a good place to begin if we want to make single diastereoisomers because we can
reverse this type of reaction: instead of making a single geometry of alkene from a single diastereoisomer, we make a single diastereoisomer from a single geometry of double bond. Here is
an example of this— again, one you have already met (Chapter 19). Electrophilic addition of
bromine to alkenes is stereospecifi c and leads to anti addition across a double bond. So if we
want the anti dibromide we choose to start with the trans double bond; if we want the syn
dibromide we start with the cis double bond. The geometry of the starting material determines the relative stereochemistry of the product.

Iodolactonization has a similar mechanism; notice how in these two examples the geometry of the double bond in the starting material defi nes the relative stereochemistry highlighted in black in the product.


-----

- There are two more
stereogenic centres in the
second example here and,
although they do not affect the
relative stereochemistry shown
in black, they do affect how
those two new stereogenic
centres relate to the two that
are already present in the
starting material. We discuss
how later in the chapter.


For a stereospecifi c alkene transformation, choose the right geometry of the starting material to get the right diastereoisomer of the product. Don’t try to follow any ‘rules’ over this—
just work through the mechanism.
Now for some examples with epoxides. Epoxides are very important because they can be
formed stereospecifi cally from alkenes: cis alkenes give cis (or syn) epoxides and trans alkenes
give trans (or anti) epoxides.

###### Leukotrienes

Leukotrienes are metabolites of
arachidonic acid related to prostaglandins and thromboxanes.
They are made in nature (and
often in the laboratory) by
oxidation of alkenes. The letter
(e.g. A) gives the general structure and the subscript number
the number of alkenes. They are
unstable and control localized
physiological phenomena such
as blood clotting and
infl ammation.


Leukotrienes are important molecules that regulate cell and tissue biology. Leukotriene C4
(LTC4) is a single diastereoisomer with an anti 1,2 S,O functional group relationship. In nature,
this single diastereoisomer is made by an epoxide opening: since the opening is SN2 the epoxide must start off anti and, indeed, the epoxide precursor is another leukotriene, LTA4.


When Corey was making these compounds in the early 1980s he needed to be sure that the
relative stereochemistry of LTC4 would be correctly controlled, and to do this he had to make
a trans epoxide. Disconnecting LTA4 led back to a simpler epoxide.

The trans allylic alcohol needed to make this compound was made using one of the methods
we introduced in Chapter 27: reduction of an alkynyl alcohol with LiAlH4. Here is the full synthesis: alkylation of an ester enolate with prenyl bromide gives a new ester, which itself is
turned into an alkylating agent by reduction and tosylation. The alkyne is introduced as its
lithium derivative with the alcohol protected as a THP acetal. Hydrolysis of the acetal with


-----

aqueous acid gives the hydroxy-alkyne needed for reduction to the E double bond, which is
then epoxidized.


The epoxide was, in fact,
made as a single enantiomer using
the Sharpless epoxidation, which
we will describe in Chapter 41.

###### Stereoselective reactions

For most of the rest of the chapter we shall discuss stereoselective reactions. You have already
met several examples and we start with a summary of the most important methods.

 - E1 reactions are stereoselective: they form predominantly the more stable alkene.

 - Nucleophilic attack on six-membered ring ketones is stereoselective: small
nucleophiles attack axially and large ones equatorially.

- **A comment on structural drawings of single diastereoisomers**

In the two reactions just above, a racemic starting material gives a racemic product as a single diastereoisomer. It is easy
to draw a racemic compound with just one stereogenic centre—we just avoid showing stereochemistry. But in the
products we have to show relative stereochemistry because we need to indicate which diastereoisomer is formed. There
is no way of doing this except by arbitrarily choosing one enantiomer and drawing that. If there is a danger of confusion,
we might sometimes write ‘(±)’ under the structure.

this with the (±) symbol

|---|---|


It is simpler if the starting material is a single enantiomer because the product can be a single enantiomer and a single
diastereoisomer. We develop the consequences of this at the end of the chapter, on p. 871.


###### Prochirality

Take another look at the reactions in the chapter so far—in particular those that give single
diastereoisomers (rather than single enantiomers or geometrical isomers), in other words, those
that are diastereoselective. They all involve the creation of a new, tetrahedral stereogenic centre
at a carbon that was planar and trigonal. This leads us to our fi rst new defi nition. Trigonal carbons that aren’t stereogenic (or chiral) centres but can be made into them are called prochiral.

At the very start of Chapter 15 we introduced stereochemistry by thinking about the reactions of two sorts of carbonyl compounds. They are shown again here: the fi rst has a prochiral
carbonyl group. The second, on the other hand, is not prochiral because no stereogenic centre
is created when the compound reacts.

A tetrahedral carbon atom can be prochiral too—if it carries two identical groups (and so is
not a chiral centre) but replacement of one of them leads to a new chiral centre, then the carbon is prochiral.

Glycine is the only common α amino acid without a chiral centre, but replacing one of the
two protons on the central carbon with, say, deuterium creates one: the CH2 carbon is prochiral. Similarly, converting a malonate derivate into its monoester makes a chiral centre where
there was none: the central C is prochiral. Now, does this ring any bells? It should remind you
very much of the defi nitions in Chapter 31 of enantiotopic and diastereotopic in connection
with NMR spectra. Replacing one of two enantiotopic groups with another group leads to one
of two enantiomers; replacing one of two diastereotopic groups with another group leads to


-----

one of two diastereoisomers. Diastereotopic groups are chemically different; enantiotopic
groups are chemically identical.
Exactly the same things are true for the faces of a prochiral carbonyl group or double bond.
If reaction on one of two faces of the prochiral group generates one of two enantiomers, the
faces are enantiotopic; if the reaction generates one of two diastereoisomers, the faces are
diastereotopic. We will now apply this thinking to the fi rst few reactions in this chapter: they
are shown again below. The two examples in the top row have prochiral C=C or C=O bonds
with diastereotopic faces: choosing which face of the double bond or carbonyl group to react
on amounts to choosing which diastereoisomer to form. In the third example, the faces of the
prochiral carbonyl group are enantiotopic: choosing which face to attack amounts to choosing which enantiomer to form. In the fourth example, the two faces of C=O are homotopic:
an identical product is formed whichever face is attacked.

Knowing this throws some new light on the last chapter. Almost without exception, every
stereoselective reaction there involved a double bond (usually C=C, sometimes C=O) with
diastereotopic faces. The diastereotopic faces were distinguished by steric hindrance, or
by a nearby hydrogen-bonding group, and so were able to react differently with an incoming
reagent.

- In Chapter 32 we showed
that homotopic and enantiotopic
protons are identical by NMR.
Similarly homotopic faces or
groups are always chemically
identical. Enantiotopic faces are
also chemically identical
provided that all the reagents in
the reaction in question are
achiral or racemic. In Chapter 41
we will consider what happens
to enantiotopic faces when
enantiomerically pure reagents
are used.


Just like diastereotopic signals in an NMR spectrum, diastereotopic faces are always different in principle, but sometimes not so in practice. The very fi rst reaction of Chapter 32 is a
case in point: this C=O group has two diastereotopic faces, which, due to free rotation about
single bonds, average out to about the same reactivity, so we cannot expect any reasonable
level of diastereoselectivity.


We put Chapter 32 fi rst because in rings conformation is well defi ned, and this ‘averaging’
effect is held at bay. We are about to let it out again, but we will show you how it can be tamed
to surprisingly good effect.

###### Additions to carbonyl groups can be diastereoselective even without rings

What happens if we bring the stereogenic centre closer to the carbonyl group than it was in
the last example? You might expect it to have a greater infl uence over the carbonyl group’s
reactions. And it does. Here is an example.

- We have termed the major
diastereoisomer anti because
the two substituents (Me and

chain as drawn. There is no
formal defi nition of anti and syn:
they should be used only in
conjunction with a structural
drawing.

There is three times as much of one of the two diastereoisomeric products as there is of the
other, and the major (anti) diastereoisomer is the one in which the nucleophile has added to the
front face of the carbonyl group as drawn here. We can make these same two diastereo isomers
by addition of an organometallic to an aldehyde. For example, this Grignard reagent gives three
times as much of the syn diastereoisomer as the anti diastereoisomer. The major product has
changed, but the product still arises from attack on the front face of the carbonyl as shown.

-----

These two reactions are not nearly as diastereoselective as most of the reactions of cyclic
compounds you met in the last chapter. But we do now need to explain why they are diastereoselective at all, given the free rotation possible in an acyclic molecule. The key, as much with
acyclic as with cyclic molecules, is conformation.

###### The conformation of a chiral aldehyde

What will be the conformation of the aldehyde in the margin? Using the principles we outlined in Chapter 16, we can expect it to be staggered, with no eclipsing interactions, and also
with large substituents as far apart from one another as possible. A Newman projection of one
of the possible conformers might look like the one shown in the margin. There are no eclipsing interactions, and the large phenyl group is held satisfactorily far away from the O and the
H atoms of the aldehyde.
By rotating about the central bond of the aldehyde (the one represented by a circle in the
Newman projection) we can suggest a series of possible conformations. Provided we move in
60° steps, none of them will have any eclipsing interactions. The full set of six conformers is
shown here. Look at them for a moment and notice how they differ.


We shall draw heavily on the
fi rst part of Chapter 16: if you
haven’t read it recently, now might
be a good time to refresh your
memory.

Only two of them, boxed in orange, place the large Ph group perpendicular to the carbonyl
group. These yellow-boxed conformations are therefore the lowest-energy conformers and, for
the purpose of the discussion that follows, they are the only ones whose reactions we need to
consider.


-----

###### The major product arises from the most reactive conformer

Now that we have decided which are the important conformations, how do we know which
gives the product? We need to decide which is the most reactive. All we need to do is to remember that any nucleophile attacking the carbonyl group will do so from the Bürgi–Dunitz
angle—about 107° from the C=O bond. The attack can be from either side of C=O, and the
following diagrams show the possible trajectories superimposed on the two conformations we
have selected, which are in equilibrium with one another.

This is an example of the
**Curtin–Hammett principle,**
which says that it is the relative

that control selectivity, not the
relative energies of the starting
materials. It’s really more of a
reminder not to make a mistake
than a principle.

Not all four possible ‘fl ight paths’ for the nucleophile are equally favourable. For the three
shown in brown, the nucleophile passes within 30° or so of another substituent. But, for the
one shown in black, there is no substituent nearby except H to hinder attack: the conformation on the left is the most reactive one, and it reacts to give the diastereoisomer shown below.

###### Cram’s rule

You may hear ‘Cram’s rule’ used
to explain the outcome of reactions involving attack on chiral
carbonyl compounds. Cram was
the fi rst to realize that these
reactions could be predicted, but
we now know why these compounds react in a predictable
way. We will not describe Cram’s
rule because, although it often
does predict the right product, in
this case it does so for the
wrong reason. Explanations and
clear logical thinking are more
important than rules, and you
must be able to account for and
predict the reactions of chiral
aldehydes and ketones using the
Felkin–Anh model.


**Me**

**Nu** **H**



- **In order to avoid making mistakes, we suggest you:**

**•** **fi rst draw the product in a conformation similar to that of the starting material**

**•** **then redraw to put the longest chain in the plane of the paper.**

**Here, this just means drawing the view from the top of the Newman projection—there is no**
**need to rotate any bonds in this case.**


With Nu=Et we have the right product and, more importantly, we can be pretty sure it is for
the right reason: this model of the way a nucleophile attacks a carbonyl compound, called the
**Felkin–Anh model, is supported by theoretical calculations and numerous experimental**
results. Notice that we don’t have to decide which is the lower energy of the two conformations: this is not necessary because the attack in black will occur even if the conformer on the
left is the minor one in the mixture.


-----

The same reasoning accounts for the diastereoselectivity of the reduction on p. 858: fi rst we
need to draw the two important conformers of the ketone; the ones that have the large group
(Ph) perpendicular to the C=O group.

###### The effect of electronegative atoms

One of the most powerful anticancer agents known is dolastatin, isolated from the sea-hare
_Dolabella. Dolastatin contains an unusual amino acid, with three stereogenic centres, and_
chemists in Germany managed to exploit Felkin–Anh control very effectively to make it from
the much more widespread amino acid isoleucine. This is the sequence of reactions.



- When you see a selectivity
given as ‘greater than’
something it means that the
other diastereoisomer was
undetectable and here 96:4 was
the limit of detection by the
method used—possibly NMR.

The key step is the aldol reaction of the enolate of methyl acetate with the protected amino
aldehyde. To rationalize the stereoselectivity, we fi rst need to draw the two most important
conformations of this aldehyde with the large group perpendicular to C=O. The trouble is,
which do we choose as ‘large’: the NBn2 group or the branched alkyl group? Since we know
which diastereoisomer is produced we can work backwards to fi nd that it must be the NBn2
group that sits perpendicular to C=O in the reactive transition state, and not alkyl. We can
draw the best conformation without worrying about alternatives.

Now look at the diastereoselectivity of the reaction: it is much greater than the 3:1 we saw
before—more like 20:1. This really does suggest that there is a further factor at work here, and
that further factor is the electronegative N atom.
Carbonyl groups increase the reactivity of adjacent leaving groups towards nucleophilic substitution by several orders of magnitude. This was an effect that we noted in Chapter 15, where
we showed that the ketone below reacts by the SN2 mechanism 5000 times as fast as methyl
chloride itself. We explained this effect by saying that the π* of the C=O and the σ* of C–Cl
overlap to form a new, lower-energy (and therefore more reactive) LUMO. What we did not


-----

note then, because it was not relevant, is that this overlap can only occur when the C–Cl bond
is perpendicular to the C=O bond, because only then are the π* and σ* orbitals aligned
correctly.

The same thing happens even with electronegative atoms X that are not leaving groups in
the SN2 reaction (for example, X=OR, NR2, SR, etc.). The π* and σ* orbitals add together to
form a new, lower-energy molecular orbital, more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. But, if X
is not a leaving group, attack on this orbital will result not in nucleophilic substitution but in
addition to the carbonyl group. Again, this effect will operate only when the C–X and C=O
bonds are perpendicular so that the orbitals align correctly.

What does this mean for stereoselectivity? Conformations of the chiral carbonyl compound
that place an electronegative atom perpendicular to the C=O bond will be more reactive—
size doesn’t matter. So, in the dolastatin amino acid example, the conformations with NBn2
perpendicular to C=O are the only conformations we need to consider.



- **Using the Felkin–Anh model**

**To predict or explain the stereoselectivity of reactions of a carbonyl group with an adjacent**
**stereogenic centre, use the Felkin–Anh model. If you look at the next example, just below this**
**box, you can follow exactly the series of steps we suggest you take:**

**•** **Draw Newman projections of the conformations of the starting material that place a large**
**group or an electronegative group perpendicular to C=O.**

**•** **Allow the nucleophile to attack along the least hindered trajectory, taking into account the**
**Bürgi–Dunitz angle.**

**•** **Draw a Newman projection of the product that arises from attack in this way.**

**•** **Carefully fl atten the Newman projection on to the page to produce a normal structure,**
**preferably with the longest chain of C atoms in the plane of the page. Check that you have**
**done this last step correctly: it is very easy to make mistakes here. Use a model if**
**necessary, or do the ‘fl attening out’ in two stages—fi rst view the Newman projection from**
**above or below and draw that; then rotate some of the molecule about a bond if necessary**
**to get the long chain into the plane of the page.**

But, from what we have told you so far, the next reaction would present a problem: changing the metal from lithium to zinc has reversed the stereoselectivity. Using the simple Felkin–

**SMe**

The reason is that zinc can chelate sulfur and the carbonyl group. Chelation is the coordination of two heteroatoms carrying lone pairs to the same metal atom, and here it changes the
conformation of the starting material. No longer does the most reactive or most populated
conformation place the electronegative S atom perpendicular to C=O; instead it prefers S to
lie as close to the carbonyl oxygen as possible so that Zn can bridge between S and O, like this:

**Zn[2+]**

When chelation is possible, this is the conformation to consider—the one with the carbonyl
O and the other chelating atom almost eclipsing one another. It is the most populated because
it is stabilized by the chelation, and it is also the most reactive, because the Lewis-acidic metal
atom increases the reactivity of the carbonyl group. Attack is still along the less hindered
pathway, but this now leads to the other face of the carbonyl group, and the stereochemical
outcome is reversed.
Two things are needed for chelation to occur:

 - a heteroatom with lone pairs available for coordination to a metal

 - a metal ion that prefers to coordinate to more than one heteroatom at once—these are
mainly more highly charged ions, as shown in the table.

Here is another example of a reversal in selectivity that can be explained using a nonchelated Felkin–Anh model with Na[+] and a chelated model with Mg[2][+].

Not only does chelation control reverse the stereoselectivity, it gives a much higher degree of
stereoselectivity. Stereoselectivities in chelation-controlled additions to C=O groups are typically >95:5. But this fi ts in nicely with the ideas we presented at the end of the last chapter:
stereoselectivity is likely to be high if a cyclic transition state is involved. Chelation involves


-----

just such a transition state, so it should be no surprise that it lets us achieve much higher levels
of control than the acyclic Felkin–Anh model does.

Chelation is possible through six- as well as fi ve-membered rings and the reduction of the

###### Stereoselective reactions of acyclic alkenes

Earlier in the chapter we discussed how to make single diastereoisomers by stereospecifi c
additions to double bonds of fi xed geometry. But if the alkene also contains a chiral centre
there will be a stereoselective aspect to its reactions too: its faces will be diastereotopic, and
there will be two possible outcomes even if the reaction is fully stereospecifi c. Here is an
example where the reaction is an epoxidation.

###### The Houk model

In order to explain reactions of chiral alkenes like this, we need to assess which conformations are important and consider how they will react, just as we have done for chiral carbonyl compounds. Much of the work on alkene conformations was done by K. N. Houk
using theoretical computer models, and we will summarize the most important conclusions of these studies. The theoretical studies looked at two model alkenes, shown in the
margin.
The calculations found that the low-energy conformations in each case were those in which
a substituent eclipses the double bond. For the simple model alkene 1, the lowest-energy conformation is the one that has the proton in the plane of the alkene. Another low-energy conformation—only 3.1 kJ mol[−][1] higher—has one of the methyl groups eclipsing the double
bond, so that when we start looking at reactions of this type of alkene, we shall have to consider both conformations.

- This effect—the control of
conformation by a cis
substituent—is known as
**allylic strain or A[1,3] strain**
because the groups involved are
on carbons 1 and 3 of an allylic
system.


For the model alkene 2, with a cis substituent, the conformation is more predictable and the
only low-energy conformer is the one with the hydrogen eclipsing the double bond. There is
no room for a methyl group to eclipse the double bond because if it did it would get too close
to the cis substituent at the other end of the double bond.
The message from the calculations is this:

  - The lowest-energy conformation of a chiral alkene will have H eclipsing the double
bond.

  - If there is a cis substituent on the alkene, this will be the only important
conformation; if there is no cis substituent, other conformations may be important
too.

Now we can apply the theoretical model to some real examples.

###### Stereoselective epoxidation

We started this section with a diastereoselective epoxidation of an alkene. The alkene was this
one, and it has a substituent cis to the stereogenic centre. We can therefore expect it to have
one important conformation, with H eclipsing the double bond. When a reagent—m-CPBA
here—attacks this conformation, it will approach the less hindered face, and the outcome is
shown.

You saw at the end of the last chapter that the reactions of _m-CPBA can be directed by_
hydroxyl groups, and the same thing happens in the reactions of acyclic alkenes. This allylic

Drawing the reactive conformation explains the result. The thing that counts is the _cis_
methyl group: the fact that there is a trans one too is irrelevant as it is just too far away from
the stereogenic centre to have an effect on the conformation. The reaction uses a racemic
mixture, but to explain the diastereoselectivity we just have to pick one enantiomer and show
what happens to that.

###### Stereoselective enolate alkylation

Chiral enolates can be made from compounds with a stereogenic centre β to a carbonyl
group. Once the carbonyl is deprotonated to form the enolate, the stereogenic centre is
next to the double bond and in a position to control the stereoselectivity of its reactions.
The scheme below shows stereoselectivity in the reactions of some chiral enolates with
methyl iodide.

The enolate is a cis-substituted alkene because either O or OEt must be cis to the stereogenic
centre, so that to explain the stereoselectivity we need consider only the conformation with
H eclipsing the double bond. Notice how the diastereoselectivity increases as the group R gets
bigger because there is then more contrast between the size of Me and R. In each case, the
electrophile adds to the less hindered face, opposite R.

The other diastereoisomer can be made just by having the methyl group in place fi rst and
then protonating the enolate. The selectivities are lower (because a proton is small), but this
does illustrate the way in which reversing the order of introduction of two groups can reverse
the stereochemical outcome of the reaction.

the enolization step so either
diastereoisomer or a mixture can
be used.

###### Aldol reactions can be stereoselective

Only one new stereogenic centre is created, so there is no question of diastereoselectivity.
But with substituted enolates, two new stereogenic centres are created and we need to be able
to predict which diastereoisomer will be formed. Here is an example from p. 626. We did not
consider stereochemistry at that stage, but we can now reveal that the syn diastereoisomer is
the major product of the reaction.

The important point about substituted enolates is that they can exist as two geometrical
isomers, cis or trans. Which enolate is formed is an important factor controlling the diastereoselectivity because it turns out that, in many examples of the aldol reaction, cis enolates give
_syn aldols preferentially and trans enolates give anti aldols preferentially._


-----

- This is a very general rule
and there are many
exceptions—the enolates of
some metals [Sn(II), Zr, Ti] give
syn aldols regardless of enolate
geometry. Some related
reactions are discussed in
Chapter 41.


Let’s start by showing some examples and demonstrating how we know this to be the case.
Some enolates can exist only as trans enolates because they are derived from cyclic ketones.
This enolate, for example, reacts with aldehydes to give only the anti aldol product.

only trans enolate can form

If we choose the group ‘X’, next to the carbonyl group, to be large, then we can be sure of
getting just the cis enolate. So, for example, the lithium enolate of this t-butyl ketone forms
just as one geometrical isomer, and reacts with aldols to give only the syn aldol product.

_cis enolate keeps Me and t-Bu apart_ _syn aldol_

###### cis and trans, E and Z, syn and anti

Before going further, there are two points we must clarify. The fi rst is a problem of nomenclature, and concerns the
enolates of esters. Here are two closely related ester enolate equivalents, drawn with the same double bond geometry.
Is it E or Z ?

**O** **LDA** **OLi** **Me3SiCl** **OSiMe3**

**Me** **Me**
**MeO** **MeO** **MeO**

The answer is both! For the Li enolate, the usual rule makes OLi of lower priority than OMe (because Li has a smaller
atomic number than C), so it’s E, while the silyl enol ether (or ‘silyl ketene acetal’) has OSi of higher priority than OMe
(Si has a larger atomic number than C), so it’s Z. This is merely a nomenclature problem, but it would be irritating to have
to reverse all our arguments for lithium and boron enolates (as opposed to, say, tin or silicon ones). So, for the sake of
consistency, it is much better to avoid the use of E and Z with enolates and instead use cis and trans, which then always
refer to the relationship between the substituent and the anionic oxygen (bearing the metal).
The other point concerns syn and anti. We said earlier that there is no precise defi nition of these terms: they are a useful
way of distinguishing two diastereoisomers provided the structure of at least one of them is presented in diagrammatic
form. For aldol products the convention is that syn or anti refers to the enolate substituent (the green Me in the last
example) and the new hydroxyl group, provided the main chain is in the plane of the paper, the way we have encouraged
you to draw molecules.

###### The aldol reaction has a chair-like transition state

These are the experimental facts: how can we explain them? Aldol reactions are another
class of stereoselective process with a cyclic transition state. During the reaction, the lithium is transferred from the enolate oxygen to the oxygen of the carbonyl electrophile. This
is represented in the margin both in curly arrow terms and as a transition state structure.
A six-membered ring is involved, and we can expect this ring to adopt more or less a chair

- Our advice on p. 860, which
we follow again here, was to
draw the product fi rst of all in
the conformation of the starting
material and only then to fl atten
it out to a ‘normal’ structure.


In drawing this chair, we have one choice: do we allow the aldehyde to place R equatorial or
axial? Both are possible but, as you should now expect, there are fewer steric interactions if R
is equatorial. Note that the enolate doesn’t have the luxury of choice. If it is to have three
atoms in the six-membered ring, as it must, it can do nothing but place the methyl group
pseudoequatorial. The aldol formed from the favoured transition state structure, with R
pseudo equatorial, is shown below—fi rst in the conformation of the transition state, and then
fl attened out on to the page, and it is anti.

We can do the same for the cis enolate. The enolate has no choice but to put its methyl substituent pseudoaxial, but the aldehyde can choose either pseudoequatorial or pseudoaxial.
Again, pseudoequatorial is better and the reaction gives the product shown—the syn aldol.

###### Stereoselective enolization is needed for stereoselective aldols

The cyclic transition state explains how enolate geometry controls the stereochemical
outcome of the aldol reaction. But what controls the geometry of the enolate? For lithium
enolates of ketones the most important factor is the size of the group that is not enolized.
Large groups force the enolate to adopt the cis geometry; small groups allow the trans enolate
to form. Because we can’t separate the lithium enolates, we just have to accept that the reactions of ketones with small R will be less diastereoselective.

With boron enolates, we don’t have to rely on the structure of the substrate—we choose the
groups on boron—and we can get either cis or trans depending on which groups these are.
Boron enolates are made by treating the ketone with an amine base (often Et3N or i-PrNEt2)
and R2B–X, where X[−] is a good leaving group such as chloride or trifl ate (CF3SO3− ). With bulky

groups on boron, such as two cyclohexyl groups, a trans enolate forms from most ketones. The
boron enolate reacts reliably with aldehydes to give anti aldol products through the same sixmembered transition state that you saw for lithium enolates.

bicyclic structure known as 9-BBN (9-borabicyclononane). The bicyclic part may look large
but, as far as the rest of the molecule is concerned, it’s ‘tied back’ behind the boron, and the
methyl group can easily lie cis to oxygen. The cis enolate then gives syn aldol products. Di-nbutylboron trifl ate (Bu2BOTf) also gives cis enolates.

###### Single enantiomers from diastereoselective reactions

The aldol reactions in the last section made single diastereoisomers from two achiral compounds. No enantiomerically pure reagents were used, so the reaction had no choice but to
give the product diastereoisomer as a racemic mixture of its two enantiomers.
In all the other diastereoselective reactions in this chapter, the starting material has been
chiral, with the formation of new chiral centres controlled by the confi guration of the starting material. Whatever the diastereoselectivity of the reaction, if the starting material is racemic, so will be the product; if the starting material is enantiomerically pure, so will be the
product. The epoxidation of the allylic alcohol in the margin illustrates this point.
The reaction starts with racemic material (no stereochemistry is shown at the chiral centre)
and makes a racemic product. Of course we have only drawn one enantiomer—the only way
to draw one diastereoisomer is to choose one enantiomer and draw that—but the indication
‘ ± ‘ underneath tells you to expect an equal amount of the other enantiomer as well. Even
without this indication, you should be able to work out, in any given case, whether a compound is racemic or not, providing you know where it comes from. Here the starting material
is racemic and the reagent is achiral so the product must be racemic.
The example of this reaction earlier in the chapter (p. 856) was this type of reaction. The
starting alcohol was racemic and the product was just one racemic diastereoisomer—the all cis
compound. But if the starting material had been enantiomerically pure, so would the product.
One enantiomer gives one enantiomer of the product: the other enantiomer of the alcohol

gives the other. Both products are the same diastereoisomer (all _cis) but they are mirror_
images of each other. If you start with enantiomerically pure compounds, the products will
be enantio merically pure as well.
We gave an example of this during the discussion of the Felkin–Anh model. The starting
material was the natural amino acid isoleucine and was the enantiomer shown. The product
of the aldol reaction was therefore also a single enantiomer. The original chiral centre in both
these examples is not affected by the reaction and remains unchanged.

(S)-lactic acid


It is much more useful to make enantiomerically pure as well as diastereoisomerically pure
compounds, particularly in the synthesis of a drug. The strategy used here is to make the starting material from an enantiomerically pure compound available from nature: in this case an
amino acid. These available enantiomerically pure compounds are known collectively as the
**chiral pool. You can read more about this in Chapter 41 on asymmetric synthesis.**
If you are making an enantiomerically pure compound with more than one stereogenic
centre, only one needs be borrowed from the chiral pool, provided diastereoselective reactions can be used to introduce the others with control over relative stereochemistry. Because
the fi rst chiral centre has defi ned absolute confi guration, any diastereoselective reaction
that controls the relative stereochemistry of a new chiral centre also defi nes its absolute
confi guration.
We’ll use as an illustration a synthesis of a rare sugar, methyl mycaminoside, containing fi ve
chiral centres. Only one chiral centre comes directly from the chiral pool—the rest are introduced diastereoselectively. The naturally derived, enantiomerically pure compound used as
the starting material is (S)-lactic acid. The starting chiral centre, preserved right through the
sequence, is ringed in green.
The ring was built up using familiar chemistry from acetylated (S)-lactic acid, and a cyclization step introduced the second chiral centre in the fi nal step of the scheme below. The methyl
group goes pseudoequatorial on the newly formed ring, while the anomeric effect, which was
explained on p. 801 of Chapter 31, induces the the methoxy group to prefer the pseudoaxial
position.

The third stereogenic centre was controlled by reduction of the ketone from the axial direction to give the equatorial alcohol, which then directed introduction of the fourth and fi fth
stereogenic centres by epoxidation.

Finally, the simple nucleophilic amine Me2NH attacks the epoxide with inversion of confi guration to give methyl mycaminoside. The conformational drawing shows that all substituents are equatorial except the MeO group, which prefers to be axial because of the anomeric
effect. Starting from an enantiomerically pure compound containing one chiral centre, four
new chiral centres are introduced in sequence by diastereoselective reactions of various kinds.
The fi nal product is necessarily a single enantiomer.

###### The structure and synthesis of penaresidin

Our last example is a natural product called penaresidin A. It was isolated from a Japanese
sponge in 1991, and is now known to have the structure shown below. When it was fi rst discovered, it proved diffi cult to fi nd out the stereochemistry and, in particular, the relative
stereochemistry between the two remotely related groups of chiral centres was not initially
known.

**OH** **OH**

**HO**

**N**
**H** penaresidin A

What is sure is the relative stereochemistry around the four-membered azetidine ring: the
NMR methods described in Chapter 31 give that. What is also certain is that natural penarisidin A is enantiomerically pure. What Mori and his co-workers set out to do was to make, using
unambiguous stereoselective methods, the possible diastereoisomers of penaresidin A to discover which was the same as the natural product.
The challenge of constructing the three chiral centres at the left-hand end of the molecule
can be solved by taking just one of them from a natural source—in this case the amino acid

L-serine. The amino group of serine was protected as the Boc derivative, and the hydroxyl and
amino groups condensed with the dimethoxyacetal of acetone to form a fi ve-membered ring.
Now the free ester could be reduced with LiBH4 and oxidized to the aldehyde by the Swern
method (Chapter 27).



- Normally, axial attack occurs
on cyclohexane epoxides, as
explained in Chapter 32, but the
rule is not rigid, as you can see
here. Equatorial attack occurs
because the transition state
already has much of the stability
of the equatorially substituted
product. You should continue to
assume that related epoxides
will typically undergo axial
attack.

How will this aldehyde react with nucleophiles such as lithiated alkynes? Consider a Felkin–
Anh transition state: again, we know that the substituted nitrogen atom, being electronegative
and bulky, will lie perpendicular to the carbonyl group in the most reactive conformation.
Looking at the two alternatives shown below, it’s easy to see that the one on the right allows
unhindered attack, and in the synthesis an alkynyl anion was used to make the product shown.

Reduction of alkynes to E
double bonds is covered in
Chapter 27, p. 681.


The alkyne was then reduced to an E alkene by a dissolving metal reduction, a step which
also hydrolysed the fi ve-membered heterocycle. The next step, an epoxidation, is needed to
install the third of the chiral centres at the left-hand end of penarisidine. However, hydrogenbond directed epoxidation of this allylic alcohol would be expected to give the syn product
shown, which has the wrong relative stereochemistry between the brown OH group and the
epoxide.

- The selectivity of the
epoxidation of the E double
bond was still only moderate
(about 60:40). From the
discussion on p. 866 you should
be able to deduce why.


The solution is to use a large blocking group to prevent this brown OH group hydrogen
bonding to the m-CPBA. The t-butyldimethylsilyl group (TBDMS) is the best, and when both
OH groups are protected, some of the right diastereoisomer is formed by attack of m-CPBA on
the top face of the alkene. Reduction of the epoxide with DIBAL (i-Bu2AlH) now gives the correct diastereoisomer.

To close the ring, the green hydroxyl group was converted to a good leaving group, mesylate
(MeSO3−), ready for an attack by the nitrogen with inversion on treatment with base. Make sure
you can see how inversion at this centre gives the stereochemistry shown! The chemists knew
at this stage they were on the right track with regard to relative stereochemistry because the
NMR spectrum of structures containing any long alkyl chain R were very similar to that of the
natural compound.

###### Confi rming the stereochemistry by synthesis


inversion


The other two chiral centres at the right-hand end of the chain are so far removed from the
ring (by 10 CH2 groups) that there is no simple way to determine their stereochemistry relative to the three at the left-hand end by NMR. The solution to problems of assignment like this
is often to make the various isomers by unambiguous synthesis and compare the NMR spectra
of the natural and synthetic compounds. This is what Mori did in this case.
The chiral pool can again be called into play by using another amino acid, L-isoleucine, as
starting material. First the amino group must be converted to a leaving group by diazotization
with nitrous acid (sodium nitrite in dilute HCl) and substituted by water to give a hydroxy
acid. The acid is esterifi ed and reduced to a diol.

**OH**


We used NaNO2 in acid to
convert amino groups into
diazonium salts containing the
excellent leaving group N2 in
Chapter 22, p. 520.

We will address similar
examples of ‘neighbouring group
participation’ in Chapter 36. There
is more on α-lactones on p. 934.
The mechanism for the
diazotization step is in Chapter 22,
p. 521.

Conversion of the diol’s primary hydroxyl group to a leaving group (here a tosylate) allows
the epoxide to be formed with retention of the two stereogenic centres of the starting material. Cyclization in base gives an epoxide. Overall, the enantiomerically pure starting material is converted stereospecifi cally into a single enantiomer of a single diastereoisomer of the
epoxide.

Before we go on, look back at the fi rst reaction of this sequence—the conversion of L-leucine
to the hydroxy acid. The stereochemistry may surprise you: look carefully and you will see
that the amino group has been displaced with retention of stereochemistry. Retentive substitutions usually indicate double inversions, and here the carboxylic acid gets involved in the
displacement to give (with inversion) a very unstable compound called an α-lactone whose
strained ring is opened by water, also with inversion.

The epoxide may now be opened with a nucleophile to give the right-hand half of the target
molecule. The alkyne shown below, which has an anti relationship between the hydoxyl and
methyl groups, was made and linked to the left-hand half of penaresidin A by using it to
attack the aldehyde the method described above. However, the fi nal product was not the same
as natural penarisidin A!

Clearly, some aspect of relative stereochemistry was wrong. So the synthesis was repeated,
this time using the syn diastereosiomer of the substituted alkyne obtained using one of the
methods we will describe in Chapter 41. With this isomer the fi nal compound had spectroscopic data identical with the natural product, and the question of its stereochemistry was
solved. It is not uncommon for synthesis to be the only reliable way of proving the detailed
structure of a compound.

###### Looking forward

Once you have got hold of a molecule as a single enantiomer, however simple that molecule
may be, you can always use reliably diastereoselective reactions of the type described in this
chapter and the one before to decorate it with further chiral centres. This is a very important
point that underlies the fi eld of asymmetric synthesis, which we will cover in Chapter 41.
There you will see developments of the ideas we have just been describing, where chiral centres derived from nature are used to introduce new stereochemistry even though they themselves need not appear in the fi nal product. But before we move on to such reactions, we need
to cover a handful of important new reaction mechanisms, many of which provide further
ways of introducing new stereochemical features into molecules. The fi rst of these new classes
of reactions is cycloadditions.

###### A new sort of reaction

Most organic reactions are ionic. Electrons move from an electron-rich atom towards an
electron-poor atom: anions or cations are intermediates. Formation of a cyclic ester (a lactone)
is an example. The reaction involves fi ve steps and four intermediates. The reaction is acidcatalysed and each intermediate is a cation. Electrons fl ow in one direction in each step—
towards the positive charge. This is an ionic reaction.

- Cycloadditions are the fi rst of
three classes of pericyclic
reactions, and the whole of this
chapter will be devoted to
cycloadditions. The other two—
sigmatropic and electrocyclic
reactions—are discussed in
Chapter 35.


Both mechanisms are equally correct. The electrons do not really rotate at all. In reality
two π bonds disappear and two σ bonds take their place by the electrons moving smoothly
out of the π orbitals into the σ orbitals. Such a reaction is called a cycloaddition. We must
spend some time working out how this could happen. First, just consider the orbitals that
overlap to form the new bonds. Providing the reagents approach in the right way, nothing
could be simpler.

The black p orbitals are perfectly aligned to make a new σ bond, as are the two green orbitals, while the two brown orbitals are exactly right for the new π bond at the back of the ring.

One reason that the Diels–Alder reaction goes so well is that the transition state has six

missing two σ bonds. This simple picture is fi ne as far as it goes, but it is incomplete. We
shall return to a more detailed orbital analysis when we have described the reaction in
more detail.

###### General description of the Diels–Alder reaction

Diels–Alder reactions occur between a conjugated diene and an alkene, usually called the
**dienophile. Here are some examples: fi rst an open-chain diene with a simple unsaturated**
aldehyde as the dienophile.


**CHO**

The mechanism is the same and a new six-membered ring is formed having one double

The mechanism leads clearly to the fi rst drawing of the product but this is a cage structure
and the second drawing is better. The new six-membered ring is outlined in black in both
diagrams. A more elaborate example shows that quite complex molecules can be quickly
assembled with this wonderful reaction.

###### The diene


**MeO**


The diene component in the Diels–Alder reaction can be open-chain or cyclic and it can
have many different kinds of substituents. There is only one limitation: it must be able to
take up the conformation shown in the mechanism. Butadiene normally prefers the
s-trans conformation with the two double bonds as far away from each other as possible
for steric reasons. The barrier to rotation about the central σ bond is small (about 30 kJ
mol[−][1] at room temperature) and rotation to the less favourable but reactive s-cis conformation is rapid.



- The ‘s’ in the terms ‘s-cis’
and ‘s-trans’ refers to a σ bond
and indicates that these are
conformations about a single
bond and not confi gurations
about a double bond.

Cyclic dienes that are permanently in the s-cis conformation are exceptionally good at
Diels–Alder reactions—cyclopentadiene is a classic example—but cyclic dienes that are permanently in the s-trans conformation and cannot adopt the s-cis conformation will not do the
Diels–Alder reaction at all. The two ends of these dienes cannot get close enough to react with
an alkene and, in any case, the product would have an impossible trans double bond in the
new six-membered ring. (In the Diels–Alder reaction, the old σ bond in the centre of the diene
becomes a π bond in the product and the conformation of that σ bond becomes the confi guration of the new π bond in the product.)



- **The diene**

**The diene must have the s-cis conformation.**


###### The dienophile

The dienophiles you have seen in action so far all have one thing in common. They have an
electron-withdrawing group conjugated to the alkene. This is a common, although not exclusive, feature of Diels–Alder dienophiles. There must be some extra conjugation—at least a phenyl group or a chlorine atom—or the cycloaddition does not occur. You will often see the
reaction between butadiene and a simple alkene (even ethylene) given in books as the basic
Diels–Alder reaction. This occurs in only poor yield. Attempts to combine even such a reactive
diene as cyclopentadiene with a simple alkene lead instead to the dimerization of the diene.
One molecule acts as the diene and the other as the dienophile to give the cage structure shown.

###### Cyclopentadiene

Cyclopentadiene is formed in considerable amounts during the refi ning of petroleum. It exists as its dimer at room
temperature but can be dissociated into the monomer on heating—the effect of the increased importance of entropy at
higher temperatures (Chapter 12). It can be chlorinated to give hexachlorocyclopentadiene, and the Diels–Alder product
of this diene with maleic anhydride is a fl ame retardant.

mean by ‘activate’ in this sense? We shall return to that question in a minute.

###### Dieldrin and Aldrin

In the 1950s two very effective pesticides were launched and their names were ‘Dieldrin’ and ‘Aldrin’. As you may guess
they were made by the Diels–Alder reaction. Aldrin is derived from two consecutive Diels–Alder reactions. In the fi rst,
cyclopentadiene reacts with acetylene to give a simple symmetrical cage molecule ‘norbornadiene’ (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene). Norbornadiene is not conjugated and cannot take part in a Diels–Alder reaction as a diene. However, it is quite
strained because of the cage and it reacts as a dienophile with perchlorocyclopentadiene to give Aldrin.

This is quite a complex product but we hope you can see how it is made up by looking at the two new bonds marked in
black. Dieldrin is the epoxide of Aldrin. The use of these compounds, like that of many organochlorine compounds, was
eventually banned when it was found that chlorine residues were accumulating in the fat of animals high up in the food
chain, such as birds of prey and humans.

###### The product

Recognizing a Diels–Alder product is straightforward. Look for the six-membered ring, the
double bond inside the ring, and the conjugating group outside the ring and on the opposite
side of the ring from the alkene. These three features mean that the compound is a possible
Diels–Alder product.
The simplest way to fi nd the starting materials is to carry out a disconnection that is closer
to a real reaction than most. Just draw the reverse Diels–Alder reaction. To do this, draw three
arrows going round the cyclohexene ring, starting the fi rst arrow in the middle of the double
bond. It doesn’t, of course, matter which way round you go.

The reaction couldn’t be simpler—just heat the components together without solvent or

sealed tube if the reagents are volatile, as here.

###### Stereochemistry

The Diels–Alder reaction is stereospecifi c. If there is stereochemistry in the dienophile, then it
is faithfully reproduced in the product. Thus cis and trans dienophiles give different diastereoisomers of the product. Esters of maleic and fumaric acids provide a simple example.

In both cases the ester groups simply stay where they are. They are cis in the dienophile
in the fi rst reaction and remain cis in the product. They are trans in the dienophile in the
second reaction and remain trans in the product. The second example may look less convincing—may we remind you that the diene actually comes down on top of the dienophile
like this:

One of the CO2Me groups is tucked under the diene in the transition state and then, when
the product molecule is fl attened out in the last drawing, that CO2Me group appears underneath the ring. The brown hydrogen atom remains cis to the other CO2Me group.
The search by the Parke–Davis company for drugs to treat strokes provided an interesting
application of dienophile stereochemistry. The kinds of compound they wanted were tricylic amines. They don’t look like Diels–Alder products at all. But if we insert a double
bond in the right place in the six-membered ring, Diels–Alder (D–A) disconnection
becomes possible.

Butadiene is a good diene, but the enamine required is not a good dienophile. An electronwithdrawing group such as a carbonyl or nitro group is preferable: either would do the job. In
the event a carboxylic acid that could be converted into the amine by a rearrangement with
(PhO)2PON3 was used.

- You can add the Diels–Alder
reaction to your mental list of
reactions to consider for making
a single diastereoisomer from a
single geometrical isomer of an
alkene: see Chapter 33.


The stereochemistry at the ring junction must be cis because the cyclic dienophile can have
only a cis double bond. Hydrogenation removes the double bond in the product and shows
just how useful the Diels–Alder reaction is for making saturated rings, particularly when
there is some stereochemistry to be controlled.

###### Stereochemistry of the diene

This is slightly more complicated as the diene can be cis,cis, or cis,trans (there are two of these
if the diene is unsymmetrical), or trans,trans. We shall look at each case with the same dienophile, an acetylene dicarboxylate, as there is then no stereochemistry in the triple bond!
Starting with cis,cis-dienes is easy if we make the diene cyclic.

The diene has two sets of substituents—inside and outside. The inside one is the bridging
CH2 group and it has to end up on one side of the molecule (above in the last diagram) while
the two green hydrogens are outside and remain so. In the fi nal diagram they are below the
new six-membered ring. With a trans,trans-diene we simply exchange the two sets of substituents, in this example putting Ph where H was and putting H where the bridging CH2 group
was. This is the reaction:

The green Ph groups end up where the hydrogens were in the fi rst example—beneath the
new six-membered ring—and the hydrogens end up above. It may seem puzzling at fi rst that
a trans,trans-diene gives a product with the two phenyls cis. Another way to look at these two
reactions is to consider their symmetry. Both have a plane of symmetry throughout and the
products must have this symmetry too because the reaction is concerted and no signifi cant
movement of substituents can occur. The orange dotted line shows the plane of symmetry,
which is at right angles to the paper.

The red R group may seem to get in the way of the reaction but, of course, the dienophile is
not approaching in the plane of the diene but from underneath. It is diffi cult to fi nd a convincing example of this stereochemistry as there are so few known, partly because of the diffi culty of making E,Z dienes. One good approach uses two reactions you met in Chapter 29 for
the control of double-bond geometry. The cis double bond is put in fi rst by the addition of
methanol to butadiyne and the trans double bond then comes from LiAlH4 reduction of the
intermediate acetylenic alcohol.

- These names arise from the
relationship in space between
the carbonyl groups on the
dienophile and the newly
formed double bond in the
middle of the old diene. If these
are on the same side they are
called endo (inside) and if they
are on opposite sides they are
called exo (outside).


Now to the most interesting cases of all, when both the diene and the dienophile have
stereochemistry.

###### The endo rule for the Diels–Alder reaction

It is probably easier to see this when both the diene and the dienophile are cyclic. All the
double bonds are cis and the stereochemistry is clearer. In the most famous Diels–Alder reaction of all time, that between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride, there are two possible
products that obey all the rules we have so far described. They are the only possible diastereoisomers of the product—although it has four stereogenic centres, any other diastereoisomers
would be impossibly strained.

The two green hydrogen atoms must be cis in the product, but now there are two such compounds, known as the exo and endo products. When the reaction is carried out, the product is, in
fact, the endo compound. Only one diastereoisomer is formed, and it is the less stable one. How
do we know this? Well, for cases in which the Diels–Alder reaction is reversible and therefore
under thermodynamic control, the exo product is formed instead. The best known example
results from the replacement of cyclopentadiene with furan in reaction with the same dienophile.

Why is the exo product the more stable? Look again at these two structures. On the left-hand

black): a one-C-atom bridge and a two-C-atom bridge. There is less steric hindrance if the
smaller (that is, the one-atom) bridge eclipses the anhydride ring.
The endo product is less stable than the exo product and yet it is preferred in irreversible
Diels–Alder reactions—it must be the kinetic product of the reaction. It forms faster because

From our previous discussion (it’s a trans,trans diene) we expect the two methyl groups to be
_cis to each other and the only question remaining is the stereochemistry of the aldehyde_
group—up or down? The aldehyde will be endo—but which compound is that? The easiest
way to fi nd the answer is to draw the reagents coming together in three dimensions. Here is
one way to do this.

**1.** Draw the mechanism of the reaction and diagrams of the product to show what you
are trying to decide. Put in the known stereochemistry if you wish. This we have just
done (see above).

**2.** Draw both molecules in the plane of the paper with the diene on top and the
carbonyl group of the dienophile tucked under the diene so it can be close to the
developing π-bond.

**3.** Now draw in all the hydrogen atoms on the carbon atoms that are going to become
stereogenic centres, that is, those shown in green here.

**4.** Draw a diagram of the product. Unfold the molecule to show the six-membered ring.
All the substituents to the right in the previous diagram are on one side of the new
molecule. That is, all the green hydrogen atoms are cis to each other.

**5.** Draw a fi nal diagram of the product with the stereochemistry of the other substituents
shown too in the usual way. This is the endo product of the Diels–Alder reaction.

###### Time for some explanations

We have accumulated rather a lot of unexplained results.

 - Why does the Diels–Alder reaction work so well?

 - Why must we have a conjugating group on the dienophile?

 - Why is the stereochemistry of each component retained so faithfully?

 - Why is the endo product preferred kinetically?

There is more. The simpler picture we met earlier in this chapter also fails to explain why
the Diels–Alder reaction occurs simply on heating while attempted additions of simple
alkenes (rather than dienes) to maleic anhydride fail on heating but succeed under irradiation with UV light.
We shall now explain all this in one section using frontier molecular orbitals. Of all the
kinds of organic reactions, pericyclic ones are the most tightly controlled by orbitals, and
the development of the ideas we are about to expound is one of the greatest triumphs of
modern theoretical chemistry. It is a beautiful and satisfying set of ideas based on very simple principles.

When an ionic cyclization reaction occurs, such as the lactonization at the head of this chapter, one important new bond is formed. It is enough to combine one full orbital with one
empty orbital to make the new bond. But in a cycloaddition two new bonds are formed at the
same time. We have to arrange for two fi lled p orbitals and two empty p orbitals to be available
at the right place and with the right symmetry. See what happens if we draw the orbitals for
the reaction above. We could try the HOMO (π) of the alkene and the LUMO (π*) of the double
bond in the anhydride (as in the margin). This combination is bonding at one end, but antibonding at the other so that no cycloaddition reaction occurs. It obviously doesn’t help to use
the other HOMO/LUMO pair, that is the HOMO of the aldehyde and the LUMO of the alkene,
as they will have the same mismatched symmetry.
Now see what happens when we replace the alkene with a diene. We shall again use the
LUMO of the electron-poor anhydride. Now the symmetry is right because there is a node in
the middle of the HOMO of the diene (the HOMO is ψ2 of the diene) just as there is in the
LUMO of the dienophile.
If we had tried the opposite arrangement, the LUMO of the diene (ψ3) and the HOMO of the
dienophile, the symmetry would again be right. The LUMO of the diene has two nodes and
gives the same symmetry as the HOMO of the dienophile, which has no nodes. So either combination is excellent. In fact most Diels–Alder reactions use electron-defi cient dienophiles
and electron-rich dienes so we prefer the fi rst arrangement. The electron-defi cient dienophile
has a low-energy LUMO and the electron-rich diene has a high-energy HOMO so this combination gives a better overlap in the transition state. The energy levels will look like this, and
the interaction shown in orange is better than the interaction shown in brown because the
orbitals are closer in energy.

-----

This is why we usually use dienophiles with conjugating groups for good Diels–Alder reactions. Dienes react rapidly with electrophiles because their HOMOs are relatively high in
energy, but simple alkenes are not suitable electrophiles because they have relatively high
energy LUMOs. The most effective modifi cation we can make is to lower the energy of the
alkene’s LUMO by conjugating the double bond with an electron-withdrawing group such as
carbonyl or nitro. These are the most common type of Diels–Alder reactions—between electron-rich dienes and electron-defi cient dienophiles.

###### Dimerizations of dienes by cycloaddition reactions

Because dienes have relatively high-energy HOMOs and low-energy LUMOs they should be
able to take part in cycloadditions with themselves. And indeed, dienes do dimerize, by a
Diels–Alder reaction. One molecule of the diene plays the role of the dienophile. The symmetry is correct for the interaction shown, and we call such reactions (like all the Diels–Alder
reactions in this chapter) ‘[4 + 2] cycloadditions’—the numbers referring to the number of
atoms of each component taking part in the reaction.

You should have expected this failure because the ends of the required orbitals must again
have the wrong symmetry, just as they had when we tried the alkene dimerization.

###### The orbital explanation for endo preference in Diels–Alder reactions

We are going to use a diene dimerization to add more detail to our explanation of the formation of endo products. To make matters even easier we shall look at the dimerization of a cyclic
diene—we might almost say the cyclic diene—cyclopentadiene. We introduced the preference
for endo products on p. 885 by saying there was a favourable electronic interaction between
the conjugating group on the dienophile and the back of the diene.

If we now draw the frontier orbitals in the two components as they come together for the
reaction, we can see fi rst of all that the symmetry is correct for bond formation (orbitals
shown in black). But we can also see what is happening at the back of the diene (orbitals in
green). The symmetry of the orbitals is correct for a bonding interaction at the back of the
diene too. This interaction does not lead to the formation of any new bonds but it leaves its
imprint in the stereochemistry of the product. The endo product is favoured because of this
bonding interaction across the space between the orbitals.

###### The solvent in the Diels–Alder reaction

We discussed some effects of varying the solvent in Chapter 12, and we shall now introduce
a remarkable and useful special solvent effect in the Diels–Alder reaction. The reaction does
not need a solvent and often the two reagents are just mixed together and heated. Solvents can
be used but, because there are no ionic intermediates, it seems obvious that which solvent is
unimportant—any solvent that simply dissolves both reagents will do. This is, in general, true
and hydrocarbon solvents are often the best.
However, in the 1980s an extraordinary discovery was made. Water, a most unlikely solvent
for most organic reactions, has a large accelerating effect on the Diels–Alder reaction. Even
some water added to an organic solvent accelerates the reaction. And that is not all. The endo
selectivity of these reactions is often superior to those in no solvent or in a hydrocarbon solvent. Here is a simple example.


Solvent Relative endo:
rate exo ratio

hydrocarbon 1 80:20
(isooctane)

water 700 96:4


_endo product_ _exo product_

The suggestion is that the reagents, which are not soluble in water, are clumped together in
oily drops by the water and forced into close proximity. Water is not exactly a solvent—it is
almost an anti-solvent! Reactions like this are sometimes called reactions ‘on water’ rather
than reactions ‘in water’.

###### Intramolecular Diels–Alder reactions

When the diene and the dienophile are already part of the same molecule it is not so important for them to be held together by bonding interactions across space and the exo product is
often preferred. Indeed, many intramolecular Diels–Alder reactions are governed more by
normal steric considerations than by the endo rule.

**H**

**H**

This reaction happens only because it is intramolecular. There is no conjugating group
attached to the dienophile and so there are no orbitals to overlap with the back of the diene.
The molecule simply folds up in the sterically most favourable way (as shown in the margin,
with the linking chain adopting a chair-like conformation) and this leads to the trans ring junction. You can see this easily in the arrangement of the hydrogen atoms.
In the next example there is a carbonyl group conjugated with the dienophile. Now the less
stable cis ring junction is formed because the molecule can fold so that the carbonyl group can
enjoy a bonding overlap with the back of the diene. This time the linking chain has to adopt
a boat-like conformation.

###### Regioselectivity in Diels–Alder reactions

The compounds that we are now calling dienophiles were the stars of Chapters 22 and 25,
where we called them Michael acceptors as they were the electrophilic partners in conjugate
addition reactions. Nucleophiles always add to the β carbon atoms of these alkenes because
the product is then a stable enolate. Ordinary alkenes do not react with nucleophiles.


**OMe** **Nu** **OMe** **H[+]**

**Nu**

**O** **O**


**Nu** **OMe**

**O**


In frontier orbital terms this is because conjugation with a carbonyl group lowers the energy
of the LUMO (the π* orbital of the alkene) and at the same time distorts it so that the coeffi cient on the β carbon atom is larger than that on the α carbon atom. Nucleophiles approach
the conjugated alkene along the axis of the large p orbital of the β carbon atom.
These same features can ensure regioselective Diels–Alder reactions. The same orbital of the
dienophile is involved and, if the HOMO of the diene is also unsymmetrical, the regioselectivity of the reaction will be controlled by the two largest coeffi cients bonding together.
So what about distortion of the HOMO in the diene? If a diene reacts with an electrophile,
the largest coeffi cient in the HOMO will direct the reaction. Consider the attack of HBr on a
diene. We should expect attack at the ends of the diene because that gives the most stable possible cation—an allyl cation as an intermediate.

In orbital terms attack occurs at the ends of the diene because the coeffi cients in the HOMO
are larger there. We need simply to look at the HOMO (ψ2) of butadiene, shown in the margin,
to see this. So it is not surprising that the dienes react in the Diels–Alder reaction through
their end carbons. But supposing the two ends are different—which reacts now? We can again
turn to the reaction with HBr as a guide. Addition of HBr to an unsymmetrical diene will give
the more stable of the two possible allyl cations as the intermediate.

- It is not ‘cheating’ to use the
regioselectivity of chemical
reactions to tell us about the
coeffi cients in orbitals. Chemistry
is about using experimental
evidence to fi nd out about the
theoretical background and not
about theory telling us what
ought to happen. In fact,
computational chemists have
calculated the HOMO energies
and coeffi cients of unsymmetrical
dienes and have reached the
same conclusions.


In orbital terms, this must mean that the HOMO of the diene is distorted so that the end
that reacts has the larger coeffi cient. When the unsymmetrical diene and the unsymmetrical
dienophile combine in a Diels–Alder reaction, the reaction itself becomes unsymmetrical.
It remains concerted but, in the transition state, bond formation between the largest coeffi cients in each partner is more advanced and this determines the regioselectivity of the
reaction.

The simplest way to decide which product will be formed is to draw an ‘ionic’ stepwise
mechanism for the reaction to establish which end of the diene will react with which end of
the dienophile. Of course this stepwise mechanism is not completely correct but it does lead
to the correct orientation of the reagents and you can draw the right mechanism afterwards.
As an example, try a diene with a substituent in the middle. This is the reaction:

First decide where the diene will act as a nucleophile and where the dienophile will act as

###### Summary of regioselectivity in Diels–Alder reactions

The important substitution patterns are a diene with an electron-donating group (X) at one
end or in the middle and a dienophile with an electron-withdrawing group (Z) at one end.
These are the products formed.

- **A useful mnemonic**

**If you prefer a rule to remember, try this one.**

**•** **The Diels–Alder reaction is a cycloaddition with an aromatic transition state that is ortho and**
**para directing.**


You can see that this mnemonic works if you look at the two products above: the fi rst has
the two substituents X and Z on neighbouring carbon atoms, just like ortho substituents on a
benzene ring, while the second has 1,4-related X and Z just like para substituents. The connection with aromaticity (the ‘aromatic transition state’) simply means that the transition
state is cyclic and has six electrons. We have not yet explored the consequences of this, but
we will do shortly.

###### Lewis acid catalysis in Diels–Alder reactions

Where the reagents are unsymmetrical, a Lewis acid that can bind to the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile often catalyses the reaction by lowering the LUMO of the dienophile still further. It has another important advantage: it increases the difference between the
coeffi cients in the LUMO (a Lewis-acid complexed carbonyl group is a more powerful electron-withdrawing group) and may therefore increase regioselectivity.

This Diels–Alder reaction is useful because it produces a substitution pattern (para) common
in natural terpenes (see Chapter 42). But the regioselectivity introduced by one methyl group
on the diene is not very great—this reaction gives a 71:29 mixture when the two compounds
are heated together at 120°C in a sealed tube. In the presence of the Lewis acid (SnCl4) the
reaction can be carried out at lower temperatures (below 25°C) without a sealed tube and the
regioselectivity improves to 93:7.

###### Regioselectivity in intramolecular Diels–Alder reactions

Just as the stereoselectivity may be compromised in intramolecular reactions, so may the
regioselectivity. It may be simply impossible for the reagents to get together in the ‘right’
orien tation. The examples below have a very short chain—just three carbon atoms—joining
diene to dienophile and so the same regioselectivity is found regardless of the position of the
conjugating carbonyl group.

The fi rst example has the ‘right’ orientation (ortho) but the second has the ‘wrong’ orientation (meta). The short tether entails no prospect of any other orientation and, as the reaction

###### The Woodward–Hoffmann description of the Diels–Alder reaction

Kenichi Fukui and Roald Hoffmann won the Nobel prize in 1981 (Woodward died in 1979 and
so couldn’t share this prize: he had already won a Nobel prize in 1965 for his work on synthesis) for the application of orbital symmetry to pericyclic reactions. Theirs is an alternative
description to the frontier orbital method we have used and you need to know a little about
it. They started by considering a more fundamental correlation between the symmetry of all
the orbitals in the starting materials and all the orbitals in the products. This is rather too
complex for us to cover here, and we shall concentrate only on a summary of the conclusions—the Woodward–Hoffmann rules. The most important of these states:



- **Woodward–Hoffmann rules**

**In a thermal pericyclic reaction the total number of (4q + 2)s and (4r)a components must be odd.**


This needs some explanation. A component is a bond or orbital taking part in a pericyclic
reaction as a single unit. A double bond is a π2 component. The number 2 is the most important part of this designation and simply refers to the number of electrons. The prefi x π tells us
the type of electrons. A component may have any number of electrons (a diene is a π4 component) but may not have mixtures of π and σ electrons. Now look back at the rule. Those designations (4q + 2) and (4r) simply refer to the number of electrons in the component where q and
_r are integers. An alkene is a π2 component and so it is of the (4q_ + 2) kind while a diene is a π4
component and so is of the (4r) kind. You have already seen the importance of 4n + 2 numbers
in aromaticity; here the signifi cance is closely related.
Now what about the suffi xes ‘s’ and ‘a’? The suffi x ‘s’ stands for suprafacial and ‘a’ for antarafacial. A suprafacial component forms new bonds on the same face at both ends while an
**antarafacial component forms new bonds on opposite faces at both ends. If you fi nd it easier**
to understand, you can think of the Woodward–Hoffmann rules like this:



- **Woodward–Hoffmann rules: alternative version**

**In an allowed thermal pericyclic reaction this sum:**

**number of suprafacial components with 2, 6, or 10 electrons**

**+  number of antarafacial components with 0, 4, or 8 electrons**

**=  an odd number**

**It’s the number of relevant components that must be odd, not (obviously) the number of**
**electrons, and you must ignore any components which aren’t mentioned in the sum (for example**
**you can have as many suprafacial components with four electrons as you like—they just don’t**
**count).**


**Z** **Z**

###### π[4] π[2]

 π[4]
 π[2]


See how this works for the Diels–Alder reaction. Here is the routine.

**1.** Draw the mechanism for the reaction (we shall choose a general one).

**2.** Choose the components. All the bonds taking part in the mechanism must be
included and no others.

**3.** Make a three-dimensional drawing of the way the components come together for the
reaction, putting in orbitals at the ends of the components (only!). The orbitals are
just unshaded p orbitals, and do not make up HOMOs or LUMOs nor any particular
molecular orbital. Don’t attempt to mix frontier orbital and Woodward–Hoffmann
descriptions of pericyclic reactions.


-----

**4.** Join up the components where new bonds are to be formed. Coloured dotted lines are
often used.

**5.** Label each component ‘s’ or ‘a’ depending on whether new bonds are formed on the
same or on opposite sides. In all of the cycloadditions you have seen so far (and indeed
the vast majority of those you will ever see), both components react suprafacially.

**6.** Count the number of (4q + 2)s and (4r)a components. If the total count is odd, the
reaction is allowed. In this case, there is **one** **(4q +** **2)s** **component (the alkene) and**
**no** **(4r)a** **components. Total = 1 so it is an allowed reaction. Components of the**
other symmetry, that is (4q + 2)a and (4r)s components, do not count. You can have as
many of these as you want.

You may well feel that there is very little to be gained from the Woodward–Hoffmann treatment of the Diels–Alder reaction. It does not explain the endo selectivity nor the regioselectivity. However, the Woodward–Hoffmann treatment of other pericyclic reactions (particularly
electrocyclic reactions, in the next chapter) is very helpful.

###### Trapping reactive intermediates by cycloadditions

In Chapter 22 you met the remarkable intermediate benzyne. Convincing evidence for the
existence of this implausible structure is provided by the fact that it can be trapped in a Diels–
Alder reaction. One way of generating benzyne for this purpose is the diazotization of
anthranilic acid (2-aminobenzoic acid).

[4 + 4] cycloaddition on p. 887
and the [2 + 2] cycloaddition on
p. 886 fail: draw out the

Benzyne may not look like a good dienophile but it is an unstable electrophilic molecule so

It is diffi cult to draw this mechanism convincingly. The two fl at molecules approach each

with the p orbitals on the central ring of anthracene.


-----

Another intermediate for which a cycloaddition product provides convincing evidence is
the oxyallyl cation. This compound can be made from α,α′-dibromoketones on treatment
with zinc metal. The fi rst step is the formation of a zinc enolate (compare the Reformatsky
reaction), which can be drawn in terms of the attack of zinc on oxygen or bromine. Now the
other bromine can leave as an anion. It could not do so before because it was next to an
electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. Now it is next to an electron-rich enolate so the cation
is stabilized by conjugation.

The allyl cation has three atoms but only two electrons so it can take part in cycloadditions

has one (4q + 2)s component
and no (4r)a components, and is
allowed).

cycloaddition

###### Other thermal cycloadditions

A simple consequence of the Woodward–Hoffmann rules is that cycloadditions involving a
total (4n + 2) electrons, if they are all suprafacial, are always allowed: they must always involve
an odd number of (4q + 2)s components. Such reactions are often referred to as having ‘aromatic transition states’ because of the obvious link with the aromatic requirement for (4n + 2)
electrons. Six is the most common (4n + 2) number, but there are also a few cycloadditions
involving ten electrons. These are mostly diene + triene, that is, π4s + π6s cycloadditions. Here
are a couple of examples.

In the fi rst case, there is an endo relationship between the carbonyl group and the back of the
diene—this product is formed in 100% yield. In the second case Et2NH is lost from the fi rst product under the reaction conditions to give the hydrocarbon shown. This type of reaction is more
of an oddity: by far the most important type of cycloaddition is the Diels–Alder reaction.

###### The Alder ‘ene’ reaction

The Diels–Alder reaction was originally called the ‘diene reaction’ so, when half of the famous
team (Kurt Alder) discovered an analogous reaction that requires only one alkene, it was
called the Alder ene reaction and the name has stuck. Compare here the Diels–Alder and the
Alder ene reactions.

The simplest way to look at the ene reaction is to picture it as a Diels–Alder reaction in
which one of the double bonds in the diene has been replaced by a C–H bond (green). The
reaction does not form a new ring, the product has only one new C–C bond (shown in black
on the product), and a hydrogen atom is transferred across space. Otherwise, the two reactions are remarkably similar.
The ene reaction is rather different in orbital terms. For the Woodward–Hoffmann description of the reaction we must use the two electrons of the C–H bond to replace the two electrons of the double bond in the Diels–Alder reaction, but we must make sure that all the
orbitals are parallel, as shown.
The C–H bond is parallel with the p orbitals of the ene so that the orbitals that overlap to form
the new π bond are already parallel. The two molecules approach one another in parallel planes
so that the orbitals that overlap to form the new σ bonds are already pointing towards each other.
Because the electrons are of two types, π and σ, we must divide the ene into two components, one

π[2 and one ]σ[2. We can then have an all-suprafacial reaction with three components.]
All three components are of the (4q + 2)s type so all count and the total is three—an odd
number—so the reaction is allowed. We have skipped the step-by-step approach we used for
the Diels–Alder reaction because the two are so similar, but you should convince yourself that
you can apply it here.
Now for some real examples. Most ene reactions with simple alkenes are with maleic anhydride. Other dienophiles—or enophiles as we should call them in this context—do not work
very well. However, with one particular alkene, the natural pine tree terpene β-pinene, a reaction does occur with enophiles such as acrylates.



- We discuss in more detail in
Chapter 35 how to assign s or a
with σ bonds. Here the σ bond
reacts suprafacially because the
1s orbital of H has no nodes.

The major interaction between these two molecules is between the nucleophilic end of the
exocyclic alkene and the electrophilic end of the acrylate. These atoms have the largest coeffi cients in the HOMO and LUMO, respectively, and, in the transition state, bond formation
between these two will be more advanced than anywhere else. For most ordinary alkenes and
enophiles, Lewis acid catalysis to make the enophile more electrophilic, or an intramolecular
reaction (or both!), is necessary for an effi cient ene reaction.

The ‘ene’ component is delivered to the bottom face of the enone, as its tether is too short
for it to reach the top face, and a cis ring junction is formed. The stereochemistry of the third
centre is most easily seen by a Newman projection (Chapter 16) of the reaction. In the diagram in the margin we are looking straight down the new C–C bond and the colour coding
should help you to see how the stereochemistry follows.

the carbonyl ene reaction

**R**


Since the twin roles of the enophile are to be attacked at one end by a C=C double bond and
at the other by a proton, a carbonyl group is actually a very good enophile. These reactions are
usually called ‘carbonyl ene’ reactions.
The important interaction is between the HOMO of the ene system and the LUMO of
the carbonyl group—and a Lewis-acid catalyst can lower the energy of the LUMO still further. If there is a choice, the more electrophilic carbonyl group (the one with the lower
LUMO) reacts.


It is not obvious what has happened in the fi rst step, but the movement of the alkene and
the closure of the ring with the formation of one (not two) new C–C bonds should give you
the clue that this is a Lewis-acid-catalysed carbonyl ene reaction.
The stereochemistry comes from an all-chair arrangement in the conformation of the transition state. The methyl group will adopt an equatorial position in this conformation, fi xing
the way the other bonds are formed. Again, colour coding should make it clearer what has
happened.

###### Allowed reactions

Because a reaction is ‘allowed’
doesn’t mean that it will happen. It just means it is theoretically possible. In the same way
you might be ‘allowed’ to jump
off a three metre wall, but you
wouldn’t do it.


###### Photochemical [2 + 2] cycloadditions

We shall now leave six-electron cyclodadditions such as the Diels–Alder and ene reactions
and move on to some four-electron cycloadditions. Clearly, four is not a (4n + 2) number, but
when we described the Woodward–Hoffman rules on p. 892 we used the term ‘thermally’. All


###### Menthol manufacture

It may seem odd to you to have a chemical process to produce menthol, which would be available naturally from mint
plants. This process is now responsible for much of the world’s menthol production so it must make some sort of
sense! The truth is that menthol cultivation is wasteful in good land that could produce food crops such as rice while
the starting material for menthol manufacture is the same β-pinene we have just met. This is available in large quantities from pine trees grown on poor land for paper and furniture. The earlier stages of the process are discussed in
Chapter 41.


-----

suprafacial cycloadditions with 4n electrons are allowed if the reaction is not thermal (that is,
driven by heat energy) but photochemical (that is, driven by light energy). Under photochemical conditions, the rules switch such that all the cycloadditions that are not allowed
thermally are allowed photochemically. This works because the problem of the incompatible
symmetry in trying to add two alkenes together is avoided by converting one of them into the
excited state photochemically. First, one electron is excited by the light energy from the π to
the π* orbital.

Now, combining the excited state of one alkene with the ground state of another solves the
symmetry problem. Mixing the two π orbitals leads to two molecular orbitals, and two electrons go down in energy while only one goes up. Mixing the two π* orbitals is as good—one
electron goes down in energy and none goes up. The result is that three electrons go down in
energy and only one goes up. Bonding can occur.

Alkenes can be dimerized photochemically in this way, but reaction between two different
alkenes is more interesting. If one alkene is bonded to a conjugating group, it alone will absorb
UV light and be excited while the other will remain in the ground state. It is diffi cult to draw
a mechanism for these reactions as we have no simple way to represent the excited alkene.
Some people draw it as a diradical (since each electron is in a different orbital); others prefer
to write a concerted reaction on an excited alkene marked with an asterisk.

The reaction is stereospecifi c within each component but there is no endo rule—there is a

results. The dotted lines on the central diagram simply show the bonds being formed. The two
old rings keep out of each other’s way during the reaction and the conformation of the product looks reasonably unhindered.

You may be wondering why the reaction works at all, given the strain in a four-membered
ring: why doesn’t the product just go back to the two starting materials? This reverse reaction
is governed by the Woodward–Hoffmann rules, just like the forward one, and to go back again
the four-membered ring products would have to absorb light. But since they have now lost


-----

their π bonds they have no low-lying empty orbitals into which light can promote electrons
(see Chapter 7). The reverse photochemical reaction is simply not possible because there is no
mechanism for the compounds to absorb light.

###### Regioselectivity in photochemical [2 + 2] cycloadditions

The observed regioselectivity is shown below. If we had combined the HOMO of the alkene
with the LUMO of the enone, as we should in a thermal reaction, we would expect the opposite orientation so as to use the larger coeffi cients of the frontier orbitals and to maximize
charge stabilization in the transition state.

But we are not doing a thermal reaction. If you look back at the orbital diagram on p. 897, you
will see that it is the HOMO/HOMO and LUMO/LUMO interactions that now matter in the
reactions of the excited state. The sizes of the coeffi cients in the LUMO of the alkene are
the other way round to those in the HOMO. There is one electron in this pair of orbitals—
in the LUMO of the enone in fact, as the enone has been excited by the light—so overlap
between the two LUMOs (shown in the frame) is bonding and leads to the observed product.
The easiest way to work it out quickly is to draw the product you do not expect from a normal
HOMO/LUMO or curly arrow controlled reaction.

###### Thermal [2 + 2] cycloadditions

Despite what we have told you about allowed cycloadditions, there are some thermal [2 + 2]
cycloadditions giving four-membered rings. These feature a simple alkene reacting with an
electrophilic alkene of a peculiar type. It must have two double bonds to the same carbon
atom. The most important examples are ketenes and isocyanates. The structures have two
π bonds at right angles.
Here are typical reactions of dimethyl ketene to give a cyclobutanone and chlorosulfonyl
isocyanate to give a β-lactam.


**N** **N**

**R** **SO2Cl** **R** **SO2Cl**

To understand why these reactions work, we need to consider a new and potentially fruitful
way for two alkenes to approach each other. As you saw on p. 886, thermal cycloadditions
between two alkenes do not work because the HOMO/LUMO combination is antibonding at
one end.
If one alkene turns at 90° to the other, there is a way in which the HOMO of one might bond
at both ends to the LUMO of the other. First we turn the HOMO of one alkene so that we are

looking down on the p orbitals. Then we add the LUMO of the other alkene on top of this
HOMO and at 90° to it so that there is the possibility of bonding overlap at both ends.
This arrangement looks quite promising until we notice that there is antibonding at the
other two corners! Overall there is no net bonding. We can tilt the balance in favour of bonding by adding a p orbital to one end of the LUMO and at a right angle to it so that both orbitals
of the HOMO can bond to this extra p orbital. There are now four bonding interactions
but only two antibonding. The balance is in favour of a reaction. This is also quite diffi cult to
draw!
Ketenes have a central sp carbon atom with an extra π bond (the C=O) at right angles to the
fi rst alkene—perfect for thermal [2 + 2] cycloadditions. They are also electrophilic and so have
suitable low-energy LUMOs.

###### Ketene [2 + 2] cycloadditions

Ketene itself is usually made by high-temperature pyrolysis of acetone but some ketenes are
easily made in solution. The very acidic proton on dichloroacetyl chloride can be removed
even with a tertiary amine and loss of chloride ion then gives dichloroketene in an ElcB elimination reaction. If the elimination is carried out in the presence of cyclopentadiene a very
effi cient regio- and stereospecifi c [2 + 2] cycloaddition occurs.

The most nucleophilic atom on the diene adds to the most electrophilic atom on the ketene
and the cis geometry at the ring junction comes from the cis double bond of cyclopentadiene.
It is impressive that even this excellent diene undergoes no Diels–Alder reaction with ketene
as dienophile. The [2 + 2] cycloaddition must be much faster.

###### Using the products

Dichloroketene is convenient to use, but the two chlorine atoms are not usually needed in the product. Fortunately, these
can be removed by zinc metal in acetic acid solution. Zinc forms a zinc enolate, which is converted into the ketone by
the acid. Repetition removes both chlorine atoms. You saw the reductive formation of a zinc enolate earlier in the chapter
(p. 894) and in the Reformatsky reaction (Chapter 26, p. 631).

But what do we do if we want the product of a ketene [4 + 2] cycloaddition? We must use a
compound that is not a ketene but that can be transformed into a ketone afterwards—a
**masked ketene or a ketene equivalent. The two most important types are nitroalkenes and**
compounds such as the ‘cyanohydrin ester’ in the second example.

The disconnection of a four-membered ring is very simple—you just split in half and draw the
two alkenes. There may be two ways to do this.



- The conversion of nitro
compounds to ketones by TiCl3
is an alternative to the Nef
reaction that you met in

Both sets of starting materials look all right—the regiochemistry is correct for the fi rst
and doesn’t matter for the second. However, we prefer the second because we can control
the stereochemistry by using cis-butene as the alkene and we can make the reaction work
better by using dichloroketene instead of ketene itself, reducing out the chlorine atoms

Now the disconnections are really different—one requires addition of a ketene to an imine
and the other the addition of an isocyanate to an alkene. Isocyanates are like ketenes, but have
a nitrogen atom instead of the end carbon atom. Otherwise the orbitals are the same.

And the good news is that both work, providing we have the right substituents on nitrogen.
The dichloroacetyl chloride trick works well with imines and, as you ought to expect, the
more nucleophilic nitrogen atom attacks the carbonyl group of the ketene so that the regioselectivity is right to make β-lactams.

If both components have one substituent, these will end up trans on the four-membered

You will notice that in both of these examples there is an aryl substituent on the nitrogen
atom of the imine. This is simply because N-aryl imines are more stable than their NH analogues (Chapter 11, p. 231).
When we wish to make β-lactams by the alternative addition of an isocyanate to an alkene,
a substituent on nitrogen is again required, but for quite a different reason. Because alkenes
are only moderately nucleophilic, we need a strongly electron-withdrawing group on the
isocyanate that can be removed after the cycloaddition, and the most popular by far is the
chlorosulfonyl group. The main reason for its popularity is the commercial availability of
chlorosulfonyl isocyanate. It reacts even with simple alkenes.

The alkene’s HOMO interacts with the isocyanate’s LUMO, and the most electrophilic atom
is the carbonyl carbon so this is where the terminal carbon atom of the alkene attacks. The
chlorosulfonyl group can be removed simply by hydrolysis under mild conditions via the
sulfonic acid.
With a more electron-rich alkene—an enol ether, for example, or the following example
with its sulfur analogue, a vinyl sulfi de—the reaction ceases to be a concerted process and
occurs stepwise. We know this must be the case in the next example because, even though the
starting material is an E/Z mixture, the product has only trans stereochemistry: it is stereoselective rather than stereospecifi c, indicating the presence of an intermediate in which free
rotation can take place.

in some non-concerted reactions

###### Making fi ve-membered rings: 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions

We have seen how to make four-membered rings by [2 + 2] cycloadditions, how to make sixmembered rings by [4 + 2] cycloadditions, and an example of making a seven-membered ring
by a [4 + 3] cycloaddition. But what about fi ve-membered rings? What we need is a threeatom, four-electron equivalent of a ‘diene’ and we can do a Diels–Alder reaction. Such molecules exist: they are called 1,3-dipoles and they are good reagents for [3 + 2] cycloadditions.
The molecule containing N and O atoms labelled ‘four-electron component’ is an example. It
has a nucleophilic end (O[−]) and an electrophilic end—the end of the double bond next to the
central N[+]. These are 1,3-related, so it is indeed a 1,3-dipole.

This functional group is known as a nitrone. You could think of it as the N-oxide of an
imine. The nitrone gets its four electrons in this way: there are two π electrons in the N=C
double bond and the other two come from one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom. The
two-electron component in each of these reactions is an alkene which, in a Diels–Alder
reaction, would be called a dienophile. Here it is called a **dipolarophile. Simple alkenes**
(which are bad dienophiles) are good dipolarophiles and so are electron-defi cient alkenes.
The difference between dienes and 1,3-dipoles is that dienes are nucleophilic and prefer to
use their HOMO in cycloadditions with electron-defi cient dienophiles while 1,3-dipoles, as
their name implies, are both electrophilic and nucleophilic. They can use either their
HOMO or their LUMO depending on whether the dipolarophile is electron-defi cient or
electron-rich.

One important nitrone is a cyclic compound that has the structure in the margin and adds
to dipolarophiles (essentially any alkene) in a [3 + 2] cycloaddition to give two fi ve-membered
rings fused together. The stereochemistry comes from the best approach with the least steric
hindrance, as shown. There is no endo rule in these cycloadditions as there is no conjugating
group to interact across space at the back of the dipole or dipolarophile. The product shown
here is the more stable exo product.
If the alkene is already joined on to the nitrone by a covalent bond, the dipolar cycloaddition is an intramolecular reaction, and one particular outcome may be dictated by the
impossibility of the alternatives. In the simple case below, the product has a beautifully symmetrical cage structure. The mechanism shows the only way in which the molecule can fold
up to allow a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to occur.

The importance of the Diels–Alder reaction is that it makes six-membered rings with control over stereochemistry. The importance of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions is not so much in the
heterocyclic products but in what can be done with them. Almost always, the fi rst formed
heterocyclic ring is broken down in some way by carefully controlled reactions. The nitrone
adducts we have just seen contain a weak N–O single bond that can be selectively cleaved by
reduction. Reagents such as LiAlH4 or zinc metal in various solvents (acetic acid is popular) or
hydrogenation over catalysts such as nickel reduce the N–O bond to give NH and OH functionality without changing the structure or stereochemistry of the rest of the molecule. From
the examples above, we get these products:

In each cycloaddition, one permanent C–C and one C–O bond (shown in brown) were
made. These were retained while the N–O bond present in the original dipole was discarded.
The fi nal product is an amino-alcohol with a 1,3-relationship between the OH and NH groups.

###### Linear 1,3-dipoles

In the Diels–Alder reaction, the dienes had to have an s-cis conformation about the central
single bond so that they were already in the shape of the product. Many useful 1,3-dipoles are
actually linear and although their 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions look very awkward they still
work well. We shall start with the nitrile oxides, which have a triple bond where the nitrone
had a double bond.

###### Making nitrile oxides

There are two important routes to these compounds, both of which feature interesting chemistry. Oximes, easily made
from aldehydes with hydroxylamine (NH2–OH), are rather enol-like and can be chlorinated on carbon.


-----

As you might expect, this [3 + 2] cycloaddition is a reaction involving the HOMO of the
alkene and the LUMO of the nitrile oxide so that the leading interaction that determines the
structure of the product is the one in the margin. If there is stereochemistry in the alkene, it
is faithfully reproduced in the heterocyclic adduct as is usual for a concerted cycloaddition.

Reduction of the N–O bond and the C=N double bond of the nitrile oxide cycloadducts
produces useful amino alcohols with a 1,3-relationship between the two functional groups.
As the N–O bond is the weaker of the two, it is alternatively possible to reduce just that and
leave the C=N bond alone. This gives an imine, which usually hydrolyses during work-up.

We shall end this section with the illustration of a beautiful intramolecular 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition that was used in the synthesis of the vitamin biotin. Starting at the beginning
of the synthesis will allow you to revise some reactions from earlier chapters. The starting
material is a simple cyclic allylic bromide that undergoes an effi cient SN2 reaction with a sulfur nucleophile. In fact, we don’t know (or care!) whether this is an SN2 or SN2′ reaction as the
product of both reactions is the same. This sort of chemistry was discussed in Chapter 24 if
you need to check up on it. Notice that it is the sulfur atom that does the attack—it is the soft
end of the nucleophile and better at SN2 reactions. The next step is the cleavage of the ester
group to reveal the thiolate anion.

In the margin we show how this reaction works—the nitrile oxide comes up from the underside of the seven-membered ring, pushing the black hydrogen atoms upwards and making all
the rings join up in a cis fashion. Next the cycloadduct is reduced completely with LiAlH4 so
that both the N–O and C=N bonds are cleaved. This step is very stereoselective so the C=N
reduction probably precedes the N–O cleavage and the hydride has to attack from the outside
(top) face of the molecule. These considerations are explored more thoroughly in Chapter 32.

###### Two very important synthetic reactions: cycloaddition of alkenes with osmium tetroxide and with ozone

We shall end this chapter with two very important reactions, both of which we have alluded
to earlier in the book (Chapter 19). These reactions are very important not just because of their
mechanisms, which you must be aware of, but even more because of their usefulness in synthetic chemistry, and in that regard they are second only to the Diels–Alder reaction when
considering all the reactions in this chapter. They are both oxidations—one involves osmium
tetroxide (OsO4) and one involves ozone (O3) and they both involve cycloaddition.

###### OsO4 adds two hydroxyl groups syn to a double bond

In Chapter 19 we emphasized the stereospecifi city of this reaction but now we want to consider the nature of the fi rst step (in the green frame). This is a cycloaddition between the
osmium tetroxide and the alkene. You can treat the OsO4 like a dipole, although it isn’t drawn
as one because osmium has plenty of orbitals to accommodate four double bonds. The reaction is a [3 + 2] cycloaddition or a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, whichever you prefer.

-----

The osmate ester isn’t the required product, and the reaction is usually done in the presence
of water (the usual solvent is a t-BuOH-water mixture), which hydrolyses the osmate ester to
the diol. Because both oxygen atoms were added in one concerted step during the cycloaddition, their relative stereochemistry must remain syn.
Note that, in the cycloaddition, one arrow stops on osmium and another starts on the other
side. Osmium therefore gains a lone pair of electrons and is reduced from Os(VIII) to Os(VI)—
the reaction is therefore an oxidation, and it’s one that is very specifi c to C=C double bonds
(as we mentioned in Chapter 23). As written, it would involve a whole equivalent of the
expensive, toxic, and heavy metal osmium, but it can be made catalytic by introducing a reagent to oxidize Os(VI) back to Os(VIII). The usual reagent is N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide
(NMO) or Fe(III), and typical conditions for an osmylation, or dihydroxylation, reaction are
shown in the scheme below.

In behaviour that is typical of a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction, OsO4 reacts almost as
well with electron-poor as with electron-rich alkenes. OsO4 simply chooses to attack the alkene HOMO or its LUMO, depending on which gives the best interaction. This is quite different
from the electrophilic addition of m-CPBA or Br2 to alkenes.

###### A cycloaddition that destroys bonds: ozonolysis

Our last type of cycloaddition is most unusual. It starts as a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition but
eventually becomes a method of cleaving π bonds in an oxidative fashion so that they end up
as two carbonyl groups. The reagent is ozone, O3. Again, you met this reaction in Chapter 19,
but we can now show you the full, remarkable details of the reaction mechanism.
Ozone is a symmetrical bent molecule with a central positively charged oxygen atom
and two terminal oxygen atoms that share a negative charge. It is a 1,3-dipole and does
typical 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions with alkenes. The product is a very unstable compound.
The O–O single bond (bond energy 140 kJ mol[−][1]) is a very weak bond—much weaker than
the N–O bond (180 kJ mol[−][1]) we have been describing as weak in previous examples—and
this heterocycle has two of them. It immediately decomposes—by a _reverse 1,3-dipolar_
cycloaddition.

The products are a simple aldehyde on the left and a new, rather unstable looking molecule—a 1,3-dipole known as a carbonyl oxide—on the right. At least it no longer has any
true O–O single bonds (the one that looks like a single bond is part of a delocalized system
like the one in ozone). Being a 1,3-dipole, it now adds to the aldehyde in a third cycloaddition step. It might just add back the way it came, but it much prefers to add in the other way
round, with the nucleophilic oxyanion attacking the carbon atom of the carbonyl group
like this.

This compound—known as an ozonide—is the fi rst stable product of the reaction with
ozone. It is the culmination of two 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions and one reverse 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition. It is still not that stable and is quite explosive, so for the reaction to be of any
use it needs decomposing. The way this is usually done is with dimethylsulfi de or Ph3P, which
attacks the ozonide to give DMSO and two molecules of aldehyde.

###### Summary of cycloaddition reactions

 - A cycloaddition is a one-step ring-forming reaction between two conjugated π systems
in which two new σ bonds are formed, joining the two reagents at each end. The
mechanism has one step with no intermediates, and all the arrows start on π bonds
and go round in a ring.


all arrows

π bonds


**Z** **Z**

cycloaddition



- The cycloadditions are suprafacial—they occur on one face only of each π system—
and for a thermally allowed reaction there should be 4n + 2 electrons in the
mechanism, but 4n in a photochemical cycloaddition. These rules are dictated by
orbital symmetry.

- Cycloaddition equilibria generally lie over on the right-hand side in a thermal
reaction because C–C σ bonds are stronger than C–C π bonds. In a photochemical
cycloaddition the product loses its π bonds and therefore its means of absorbing
energy. It is therefore the kinetic product of the reaction even if it has a strained fourmembered ring.


-----

 - The stereochemistry of each component is faithfully reproduced in the product—the
reactions are stereospecifi c—and the relationship between their stereochemistries may
be governed by orbital overlap to give an endo product.

In the next chapter we meet two more classes of pericyclic reactions: electrocyclic reactions
and sigmatropic rearrangements.

**Cycloadditions, the subject of the last chapter, are just one of the three main classes of peri-**
cyclic reaction. In this chapter we consider the other two classes: sigmatropic rearrange**ments and** **electrocyclic reactions. We will analyse them in a way that is similar to our**
dealings with cycloadditions.

###### Sigmatropic rearrangements

 The Claisen rearrangement was the fi rst to be discovered

The original sigmatropic rearrangement occurred when an aryl allyl ether was heated without
solvent and an ortho-allyl phenol resulted. This is the Claisen rearrangement. The fi rst step in
this reaction is a pericyclic reaction of a type that you will learn to call a [3,3]-sigmatropic
rearrangement.

[3,3]

**H**

This is a one-step mechanism without ionic intermediates or any charges, just like a cycloaddition. The arrows go round in a ring. The difference between this and a cycloaddition is
that one of the arrows starts on a σ bond instead of on a π bond. The second step in the reaction is a simple ionic proton transfer to regenerate aromaticity.

that this is right.

###### The aliphatic Claisen rearrangement also occurs

It was later found that the same sort of reaction occurs without the aromatic ring. This is
called either the aliphatic Claisen rearrangement or the Claisen–Cope rearrangement. Here
is the simplest possible example.
All these reactions are called sigmatropic because a σ bond appears to move from one place to
another during the reaction. This particular reaction is called a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement
because the new σ bond has a 3,3 relationship to the old σ bond. You can see this if you number
both ends of the old σ bond ‘1’ and count round in both directions to the ends of the new σ bond
in the product. You will fi nd that the ends of the new σ bond both have the number ‘3’.

ends numbered 1

so this is a

These [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements happen through a chair-like transition state, which
allows us both to get the orbitals right and to predict the stereochemistry (if any) of the new
double bond. The orbitals look something like this.

and that the two new σ bonds are formed from orbitals that are already parallel.

###### Alkene stereochemistry in the Claisen rearrangement comes from a chair-like transition state

Stereochemistry may arise if there is a substituent on the saturated carbon atom next to the
oxygen atom. If there is, the resulting double bond strongly favours the trans (E) geometry.
This is because the substituent prefers an equatorial position on the chair transition state.

The starting material for these aliphatic Claisen rearrangements consists of ethers with one
allyl and one vinyl group. We need now to consider how such useful molecules might be
made. There is no problem about the allyl half—allylic alcohols are stable, easily made compounds. But what about the vinyl half? ‘Vinyl alcohol’ is just the enol of acetaldehyde
(MeCHO).

The solution is to use an acetal of the aldehyde in an acid-catalysed exchange process with

formed and rearranges into the fi nal product.

###### The Claisen rearrangement is a general synthesis of γ,δ-unsaturated carbonyl compounds

The [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement itself can be carried out by heat as part of the same step
or as a separate step depending on the compounds. This is a very fl exible reaction sequence
and can be used for aldehydes (as shown above), ketones, esters, or amides. In each case acetallike compounds are used—acetals themselves for aldehydes and ketones; orthoesters and
orthoamides for the other two (although the orthoamides are often called ‘amide acetals’).



- Note that the fi rst molecule
of methanol was displaced in an
SN1 reaction and the second lost
in an E1 reaction. The chemistry
of acetals is dominated by the
loss of protonated OR or OH
groups in the steps with green
boxes. Never be tempted to write
SN2 mechanisms with acetals.

###### Orbital descriptions of [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements

It is possible to give a frontier orbital description of a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement but this
is not a very satisfactory treatment because we don’t have two separate reagents recognizing
each other across space as we did in cycloadditions. There are _three components in these_
reactions—two non-conjugated π bonds that do have to overlap across space and a σ bond in
the chain joining the two π bonds. The Woodward–Hoffmann rules give a more satisfying
description and we shall follow the routine outlined on p. 892 for cycloadditions. Note that
for stage 3, we can use the three-dimensional diagram we have already made.
First a reminder of the Woodward–Hoffmann rules:


**O** **R** **O** **R**

**1.** Draw the mechanism for the reaction (we shall stay with a familiar one).

**2.** Choose the components. All the bonds taking part in the mechanism must be
included and no others.

**3.** Make a three-dimensional drawing of the way the components come together for the
reaction, putting in orbitals at the ends of the components (only!). Note that we have
dropped the shading in the orbital from the previous diagrams earlier in the chapter.

**4.** Join up the components where new bonds are to be formed. Make sure you join
orbitals that are going to form new bonds.

**5.** Label each component s or a depending whether new bonds are formed on the same
or on opposite sides. See below for the σ bond symmetry.

**6.** Add up the number of (4q + 2)s and (4r)a components. If the sum is odd, the reaction is
allowed. Here there is:

_one (4q_ + 2)s component (one alkene) and

_no (4r)a components._

Total=1, so this is an allowed reaction. As you saw in Chapter 34 (p. 893), the π2a and σ2a
components have irrelevant symmetry and are not counted.
One new aspect of orbital symmetry has appeared in this diagram—how did we deduce a
or s symmetry in the way the σ bond reacted? For π bonds it is simple—if both bonds are
formed on the same side of the old π bond, it has reacted suprafacially; if on opposite sides,
antarafacially.
With a σ bond the symmetry is not so obvious. We want to know if it does the same thing at
each end (s) or a different thing (a). But what is the ‘thing’ it does? It reacts using the large lobe
of the sp[3] orbital (retention) or the small lobe (inversion). If it reacts with retention at both
ends or inversion at both ends, it reacts suprafacially, while if it reacts with retention at one end
and inversion at the other, it reacts antarafacially. There are four possibilities.

- If you are interested in the
frontier orbital approach to

[3,3]-sigmatropic reactions, you
could read about it in Ian
Fleming (2009) Frontier orbitals
and organic chemical reactions,
2nd edn, Wiley, Chichester. We
shall use this approach when we
come to [1,5]-sigmatropic
rearrangements.


###### π[2]s π[2]a


###### σ[2]s


###### σ[2]a


retention inversion inversion at one end
at both ends at both ends retention at the other end

In the routine above, we chose to use our σ bond so that we got inversion at one end and
retention at the other. That was why we identifi ed it as an antarafacial component. If we
had chosen another style we should have got different descriptions of the components, but
the reaction would still have been allowed, for example changing just one connecting line,
as in the margin, changes the symmetry of the σ bond so that it becomes a σ2s component
but it also changes the symmetry of one of the π bonds so that it becomes a π2a component.
The net result is still only one component of the Woodward–Hoffmann symmetry, the sum
is still 1, and the reaction still allowed.

###### The direction of [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements

Orbital symmetry tells us that [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements are allowed but says nothing
about which way they will go. They are allowed in either direction. So why does the Claisen–
Cope rearrangement always form the carbonyl-containing product? Think back to our discussion on enols (Chapter 20) and you may recall that the combination of a carbonyl group and
a C–C σ bond made the keto form more stable than the enol form with its combination of a
C=C π bond and a C–O σ bond. The same is true here. It is the stability of the carbonyl group
that drives the reaction to the right.

###### Directing the Cope rearrangement by the formation of a carbonyl group

The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement with only carbon atoms in the
ring. In its simplest version it is not a reaction at all. The starting material and the product are
the same.
We can drive this reaction too by the formation of a carbonyl group if we put an OH substituent in the right place.

The product of the sigmatropic step is the enol of the fi nal product. It turns out that the
reaction is accelerated if the starting alcohol is treated with base (KH is the best) to make the
alkoxide. The product is then the potassium enolate, which is more stable than the simple
potassium alkoxide starting material. As the reaction proceeds, conjugation is growing
between O[−] and the new π bond.

In some cases simple Cope rearrangements without any oxygen atoms at all can be directed
by an unstable starting material or a stable product. The instability might be strain and the
stability might simply be more substituents on the double bonds. In the next reaction the
driving force is the breaking of a weak σ bond in a three-membered ring. This reaction goes
in 100% yield at only just above room temperature, so it is very favourable. In the second
example, the trisubstituted double bonds inside the fi ve-membered rings of the product are
more stable than the exomethylene groups in the starting material.

###### An industrial synthesis of citral

‘Citral’ is a key intermediate in the synthesis of vitamin A, and it is manufactured by a remarkable process that involves two successive [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements, a Claisen followed
by a Cope. The allyl vinyl ether needed for the Claisen rearrangement is an enol ether of an
unsaturated aldehyde with an unsaturated alcohol. The two starting materials are themselves
derived from a common precursor, making this a most effi cient process! Heating the enol ether
promotes [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement propelled by the formation of a carbonyl group.

###### Applications of [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements using other elements

There is no need to restrict our discussion to carbon and oxygen atoms. We shall fi nish this
section with two useful reactions that use other elements. You met the most famous synthesis
of indoles in Chapter 30—the Fischer indole synthesis—and we can now look in more detail
at the key step of this remarkable reaction. Condensation of phenylhydrazine with a ketone
in slightly acidic solution gives a a phenylhydrazone.

If the ketone is enolizable, this imine is in equilibrium with the corresponding enamine.
The important bonds are given in black in the diagram. The enamine is ideally set up for a

[3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement in which the σ bond to be broken is the weak N–N σ bond
and one of the π bonds is in the benzene ring.

That was a [3,3]-sigmatropic reaction involving two nitrogens. There follows one with
two oxygens and a chromium atom. When tertiary allylic alcohols are oxidized with CrO3

occurs.

The fi rst step in Cr(VI) oxidations can take place to give a chromate ester but this intermediate has no proton to lose so it transfers the chromate to the other end of the allylic system,
where there is a proton. The chromate transfer can be drawn as a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The fi nal step is the normal oxidation in which chromium drops down from orange
Cr(VI) to Cr(IV) and eventually by disproportionation to green Cr(III).

###### [2,3]-Sigmatropic rearrangements

All [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements have six-membered cyclic transition states. It is no accident that the size of the ring is given by the sum of the two numbers in the square brackets and
this is universally the case for sigmatropic rearrangements. We are now going to look at

[2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements so we will be needing fi ve-membered cyclic transition states.
There is a problem here. You cannot draw three arrows going round a fi ve-membered ring without stopping or starting on an atom, not a bond. This can be OK if the atom is a carbanion.

The starting material is a benzyl allyl ether and undergoes [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement
to make a new C–C σ bond at the expense of a C–O σ bond—a bad bargain this as the C–O
bond is stronger. The balance is tilted by the greater stability of the oxyanion in the product
than of the carbanion in the starting material. The new bond has a 2,3 relationship to the old
and the transition state is a fi ve-membered ring.

We can use the same conformational diagram to show how the orbitals overlap as the
new bond is formed. When we come to use the Woodward–Hoffmann rules on these

[2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements, we fi nd something new. We have a π bond and a σ bond
and a carbanion. How are we to represent a carbanion (or a carbocation) that is just a p
orbital on an atom? The new symbol we use for a simple p orbital is ω (lower case omega).


-----

###### ω[2]a

**Ph**


**Ph**


A carbanion is an ω2 component and a carbocation is an ω0 component as it has zero
electrons. If the two new bonds are formed to the same lobe of the p orbital of the carbanion, we have an ω2S component, but if they are formed to different lobes we have an ω2a
component.
Without going through the whole routine again, the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement we
have been discussing can be described as an ω2a + σ2s + π2a reaction. There is one (4q + 2)s and
no (4r)a component so the reaction is thermally allowed.

###### [2,3]-Sigmatropic rearrangements with S and Se

There are many [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements involving a variety of heteroatoms as well
as carbon. The mechanism is common with elements that are prepared to change their oxidation state by two so that an arrow can both start and fi nish on that atom. The examples in this
section involve sulfur and selenium, which can both form stable compounds at three oxidation states: S or Se(II), S or Se(IV), and S or Se(VI).

Reaction of an allylic alcohol with PhSCl gives an unstable sulfenate ester that rearranges on
heating to an allylic sulfoxide by a [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement involving both O and S.
Notice that arrows both start and stop on the sulfur atom, which changes from S(II) to S(IV)
during the reaction. The new functional group with an S=O bond is a sulfoxide, and this is a
good way of making allylic sulfoxides. The product forms an anion stabilized by sulfur, which
can be alkylated.

a sulfenate ester is again formed.

A related reaction of selenium in its +4 oxidation state (as selenium dioxide, SeO2) allows us
to make allylic alcohols and enals from simple alkenes. The overall reaction is the simple oxidation shown in the margin, but the route by which the compound gets there involves two
successive pericyclic reactions.
Selenium dioxide will react with alkenes in a [4 + 2] cycloaddition reminiscent of the ene
reaction.

The initial product is an allylic seleninic acid—and just like an allylic sulfoxide (but more
so because the C–Se bond is even weaker) it undergoes allylic rearrangement to give an
unstable compound that rapidly decomposes to an allylic alcohol. In some cases, particularly this most useful oxidation of methyl groups, the oxidation continues to give an aldehyde or ketone.

Overall, CH3 has been replaced by CH2OH or CH=O in an allylic position, a transformation
similar to the allylic bromination reaction with NBS that you met in Chapter 24, but with a
very different mechanism. The by-product of the oxidation is a selenium(II) compound, and
it can be more practical to carry out the reaction with only a catalytic amount of SeO2, with a
further oxidizing agent, t-butyl hydroperoxide, to reoxidize the Se(II) after each cycle of the
reaction. This eliminates the need to get rid of large amounts of selenium-containing products, which are toxic and usually smelly.

###### [1,5]-Sigmatropic hydrogen shifts

When one of the numbers in square brackets is ‘1’, the old and new σ bonds are to the same
atom, so we are dealing with the migration of a group around a conjugated system. In the case
of a [1,5]-sigmatropic rearrangement the transition state is a six-membered ring (remember—
just add together the numbers in square brackets). There is an important example in the margin. Let us fi rst check that this is indeed a [1,5]-sigmatropic rearrangement by numbering the
position of the new σ bond with respect to the old. Note that we must go the long way round
the fi ve-membered ring because that is the way the mechanism goes.
It is a [1,5]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The fi gure ‘1’ in the square brackets shows that the
same atom is at one end of the new σ bond as was at one end of the old σ bond. One atom has
moved in a 1,5 manner and these are often called [1,5]-sigmatropic shifts. This is often abbreviated to [1,5]H shift to show which atom is moving. This particular example is important
because sadly it prohibits a most attractive idea. The aromatic cyclopentadienyl anion is easily
formed, stable, and readily alkylated. This sequence of alkylation and Diels–Alder reaction
looks very good.

###### Orbital description for the [1,5]H sigmatropic shift

It is equally satisfactory to use frontier orbitals or the Woodward–Hoffmann rules for these
reactions. We can take the diene as one component (HOMO or LUMO or π4) and the C–H
bond as the other (LUMO or HOMO or σ2). Let us start by using the LUMO of the diene (ψ3)
and the HOMO of the C–H bond (its fi lled σ orbital), as shown in the margin. If the circle
around the H atom surprised you, perhaps it will also remind you that hydrogen has only a 1s
orbital, which is spherical. You can probably see already that all the orbitals are correctly lined
up for the reaction.
The hydrogen atom slides across the top face of the planar cyclopentadiene ring. We call this
a suprafacial migration, meaning that the migrating group leaves from one face of the π system
and rejoins that same face (the top face in this example). Antarafacial migration would mean
leaving the top face and rejoining the bottom face—a clear impossibility here.

that the other frontier orbital
combination—HOMO of the

-----

If you use the Woodward–Hoffmann rules, you need to note that the hydrogen atom must
react with retention. The 1s orbital is spherically symmetrical and has no node, so wherever
you draw the dotted line from that orbital it always means retention. Choosing the components is easy—the diene is a π4 and the C–H bond a σ2 component.
The easiest way to join them up is to link the hydrogen atom’s 1s orbital to the top lobe of the
p orbital at the back of the diene and the black sp[3] orbital to the top lobe at the front of the
diene. This gives us π4s and σ2s components and there is one (4q + 2)s and no (4r)a components
so the sum is odd and the reaction is allowed. Both approaches give us the same picture—a
suprafacial migration of the hydrogen atom with (inevitably) retention at the migrating group.
These [1,5]-sigmatropic shifts are not restricted to cyclopentadienes. In Chapter 34 we
bemoaned the lack of Diels–Alder reactions using E,Z dienes. One reason for the shortage of
examples is that such dienes undergo [1,5]H shifts rather easily and mixtures of products result.

The consequences of orbital symmetry for sigmatropic hydrogen shifts are simple. In thermal reactions, [1,5]H shifts occur suprafacially but [1,3]H and [1,7]H shifts must be antarafacial. Antarafacial [1,3]H shifts are impossible, even though they are allowed, because a rigid
three-carbon chain is too short to allow the H atom to transfer from the top to the bottom—
the H atom just can’t reach. This is just as well, as otherwise double bonds would just wander
around molecules by repeated [1,3]H shifts.
When we come to [1,7]H shifts, the situation is different. Now the much longer chain is just
fl exible enough to allow antarafacial migration. The hydrogen atom leaves the top side of the
triene and adds back in on the bottom side. The diagram shows this in orbital terms: the
LUMO of hexatriene has three nodes. Antarafacial [1,7]H migration is allowed and possible.

As you should by now expect, all this is reversed in photochemical reactions. The margin

rigid ring, but that can and does occur photochemically in a suprafacial manner.
A [1,7]H shift occurs in the fi nal stages of the human body’s synthesis of vitamin D from
cholesterol. Here is the last step of the biosynthesis.

This step happens spontaneously, without the need for light, so the [1,7]H shift must be

Why, then, does the body famously need sunlight to make vitamin D? The reason is the

This ring opening is clearly pericyclic—the electrons go round in a ring, and the curly arrows
could be drawn either way—but it is neither a cycloaddition (only one π system is involved) nor
a sigmatropic rearrangement (a σ bond is broken rather than moved). It is, in fact, a member of
the third and last kind of pericyclic reaction, an electrocyclic reaction.

###### Electrocyclic reactions

In an electrocyclic reaction a ring is always broken or formed. Rings may, of course, be formed
by cycloadditions as well, but the difference with electrocyclic reactions is that just one new σ
bond is formed (or broken) across the ends of a single conjugated π system. In a cycloaddition,
two new σ bonds are always formed (or broken), and in a sigmatropic rearrangement one σ
bond forms while one breaks.

 - **The types of pericyclic reactions are distinguished by the number of σ bonds made**
**or broken**

One new σ bond is formed

...or broken. ...or broken.

∆σ = ±2 ∆σ = 0 ∆σ = ±1

∆σ is the change in the number of σ bonds

One of the simplest electrocyclic reactions occurs when hexatriene is heated to 500 °C. It is a
pericyclic reaction because the electrons go round in a ring (you could equally draw the arrows
going the other way); it’s electrocyclic because a new σ bond is formed across the ends of a π
system. The reaction goes because the σ bond that is formed is stronger than the π bond that is
lost.
The opposite is true for the electrocyclic opening of cyclobutene—ring strain in the fourmembered ring means that the reverse (ring-opening) reaction is preferred to ring closure.
In one famous case, the release of ring strain is almost exactly counterbalanced by the
formation of a σ bond at the expense of a π bond. Cycloheptatriene exists in equilibrium
with a bicyclic isomer known as norcaradiene. Usually cycloheptatriene is the major component of the equilibrium, but the norcaradiene structure is favoured with certain substitution patterns.


-----

###### Rules for electrocyclic reactions

Whether they go in the direction of ring opening or ring closure, electrocyclic reactions are
subject to the same rules as all other pericyclic reactions. With most of the pericyclic reactions
you have seen so far, we have given you the choice of using either HOMO–LUMO reasoning
or the Woodward–Hoffmann rules. With electrocyclic reactions, you really have to use the
Woodward–Hoffmann rules because (at least for the ring closures) there is only one molecular
orbital involved.



- In the same way, the
Woodward–Hoffmann rules
apply both to cycloadditions and
to reverse cycloadditions, as you
saw in Chapter 34.



- **Electrocyclic reactions**

**•** **An electrocyclic reaction is the formation of a new σ bond across the ends of a conjugated**
**polyene or the reverse.**

**It is important that you do not confuse electrocyclic reactions with pericyclic reactions. Pericyclic**
**is the name for the whole family of reactions involving no charged intermediates in which the**
**electrons go round the outside of the ring. Electrocyclic reactions, cycloadditions, and**
**sigmatropic rearrangements are the three main classes of pericyclic reactions.**


Let’s start with the hexatriene ring closure from the beginning of this section, fi rst looking
at the orbitals and then following the same procedure that we taught you for cycloadditions
and sigmatropic rearrangements to see what the Woodward–Hoffmann rules have to say
about the reaction.
Hexatriene is, of course, a 6π electron (π6) conjugated system and, on forming cyclohexadiene, the end two orbitals must rotate through 90° to form a σ bond.
So, now for the Woodward–Hoffmann treatment.

**1.** Draw the mechanism for the reaction.

**2.** Choose the components. All the bonds taking part in the mechanism must be
included and no others.

**3.** Make a three-dimensional drawing of the way the components come together for the
reaction, putting in orbitals at the ends of the components (only!).

**4.** Join up the components where new bonds are to be formed. Make sure you join
orbitals that are going to form new bonds.

**5.** Label each component s or a depending on whether new bonds are formed on the
same or on opposite sides. We called this reaction ‘s’ because the top halves of the two
π orbitals join together.

**6.** Add up the number of (4q + 2)s and (4r)a components. If the sum is odd, the reaction is
allowed. Here there is one (4q + 2)s component and no (4r)a components. Total = 1 so
this is an allowed reaction.

We can give the same treatment to the cyclobutene ring-opening reaction—the Woodward–
Hoffmann rules tell us nothing about which way the reaction will go, only if the reaction is
allowed, and it is usually easier with electrocyclic reactions to consider the ring-closing reaction
even if ring opening is favoured thermodynamically. This is the process we need to consider:

for this consider the
reaction: reverse process:

- The green arrows in this and
subsequent diagrams are merely

with real mechanistic curly
arrows.


And the Woodward–Hoffmann treatment again.

**1.** Draw the mechanism for the reaction.

**2.** Choose the components. All the bonds taking part in the mechanism must be
included and no others.

**3.** Make a three-dimensional drawing of the way the components come together for the
reaction, putting in orbitals at the ends of the components (only!).

**4.** Join up the components where new bonds are to be formed. Make sure you join
orbitals that are going to form new bonds.

**5.** Label each component s or a depending on whether new bonds are formed on the
same or on opposite sides.

**6.** Add up the number of (4q + 2)s and (4r)a components. If the sum is odd, the reaction is
allowed. There are no (4q + 2)s components and no (4r)a components. Total = 0 so this
is a disallowed reaction.

Oh dear! We know that the reaction works, so something must be wrong. It certainly isn’t
Woodward and Hoffmann’s Nobel-prize-winning rules—it’s our way of drawing the orbital
overlap that is at fault. We were fi ne up to stage 3 (we had no choice till then)—but see what
happens if we make the orbitals overlap in a different way.

**1.** As before.

**2.** As before.

**3.** Make a three-dimensional drawing of the way in which the components come together
for the reaction, putting in orbitals at the ends of the components (only!).

**4.** Join up the components where new bonds are to be formed. Make sure you join
orbitals that are going to form new bonds.

**5.** Label each component s or a depending on whether new bonds are formed on the
same or on opposite sides.

**6.** Add up the number of (4q + 2)s and (4r)a components. If the sum is odd, the reaction is
allowed. There are no (4q + 2)s components and one (4r)a component. Total = 1 so this
is an allowed reaction.

Now it works! In fact, extension of this reasoning to other electrocyclic reactions tells you
that they are all allowed—provided you choose to make the conjugated system react with
itself suprafacially for (4n + 2) π systems and antarafacially for (4n) π systems. This may not
seem particularly informative, since how you draw the dotted line has no effect on the reaction product in these cases. But it can make a difference. Here is the electrocyclic ring closure of an octatriene, showing the product from (a) suprafacial reaction and (b) antarafacial
reaction.

###### Conrotatory and disrotatory reactions

Whether the reaction is supra- or antarafacial ought to be refl ected in the relative stereochemistry of the cyclized products—and indeed it is. The reaction above gives solely the
diastereoisomer on the left, with the methyl groups syn—clear proof that the reaction is suprafacial. This is a diffi cult result to explain without the enlightenment provided by the
Woodward–Hoffmann rules! This electrocyclic cyclobutene ring opening also gives the product as a single stereoisomer.

Again, if we draw the reverse reaction, we can see that the reaction required has to be antarafacial for the stereochemistry to be right.

**Me** **H** **Me** **H**

only this geometrical isomer… π[4]a ...can give this diastereoisomer

We have drawn little green arrows on the diagrams to show how the methyl groups move as
the new σ bonds form. For the allowed suprafacial reaction of the 6π electron system they
rotate in opposite directions so the reaction is called disrotatory (yes, they both go up, but
one has to rotate clockwise and one anticlockwise) while for the allowed antarafacial reaction
of the 4π electron system they rotate in the same direction so the reaction is called conrota**tory (both clockwise as drawn, but they might equally well have both gone anticlockwise).**
We can sum up the course of all electrocyclic reactions quite simply using these words.



- **Rules for electrocyclic reactions**

**•** **All electrocyclic reactions are allowed.**

**•** **Thermal electrocyclic reactions involving (4n + 2) π electrons are disrotatory.**

**•** **Thermal electrocyclic reactions involving (4n) π electrons are conrotatory.**

**•** **In conrotatory reactions the two groups rotate in the same turning sense: both clockwise or**
**both anticlockwise.**

**•** **In disrotatory reactions, one group rotates clockwise and one anticlockwise.**


This rotation is the reason why you must carefully distinguish electrocyclic reactions from
all other pericyclic reactions. In cycloadditions and sigmatropic rearrangements there are
small rotations as bond angles adjust from 109° to 120° and vice versa, but in electrocyclic
reactions rotations of nearly 90° are required as a planar polyene becomes a ring or vice versa.
These rules follow directly from application of the Woodward–Hoffmann rules—you can
check this for yourself.


###### Electrocyclic reactions in nature: the endiandric acids

A beautiful example of electrocyclic reactions at work is provided by the chemistry of the endiandric acids. This family of
natural products, of which endiandric acid D is one of the simplest, is remarkable in being racemic—most chiral natural
products are enantiomerically pure (or at least enantiomerically enriched) because they are made by enantiomerically
pure enzymes (we discuss all this in Chapter 42). So it seemed that the endiandric acids were formed by non-enzymatic
cyclization reactions, and in the early 1980s their Australian discoverer, Black, proposed that their biosynthesis might
involve a series of electrocyclic reactions, starting from an acyclic polyene precursor.

###### Photochemical electrocyclic reactions

After your experience with cycloadditions and sigmatropic rearrangements, you will not be
surprised to learn that, in photochemical electrocyclic reactions, the rules regarding conrotatory and disrotatory cyclizations are reversed.

In its simplest form, the Nazarov cyclization is the ring closure of a doubly α,β-unsaturated

Dienyl cations and dienyl anions both undergo electrocyclic ring closure—a nice example occurs when this cyclooctadiene is deprotonated with butyllithium. There are still fi ve
p orbitals involved in the cyclization, but now there are six π electrons, so the reaction is
disrotatory.

In this case, it is the conrotatory photochemical cyclization that is prevented by strain (it was
tried—cyclooctadienyl anion is stable for at least a week at –78 °C in broad daylight) as the
product would be a 5,5 trans-fused system. The same strain prevents thermal electrocyclic
ring closure of cyclooctadienyl cations.



- **All electrocyclic reactions are allowed**

**It would be a good point here to remind you that, although all electrocyclic reactions are**
**allowed both thermally and photochemically providing the rotation is right, the steric**
**requirements for con- or disrotatory cyclization or ring opening may make one or both modes**
**impossible.**


###### Small rings are opened by electrocyclic reactions

Ring strain is important in preventing a reaction that would otherwise change your view of a
lot of the chemistry you know. Allyl cations are conjugated systems containing 2π electrons,
so if you knew no other chemistry than what is in this chapter you might expect them to
cyclize via disrotatory electrocyclic ring closure. The product would be a cyclopropyl cation.

In fact, it is the cyclopropyl cations that undergo this reaction (very readily indeed—
cyclopropyl cations are virtually unobservable) because ring strain encourages them to
undergo electrocyclic ring opening to give allyl cations. The instability of cyclopropyl cations
means that, even as they start to form as intermediates, they spring open to give allyl cationderived products. Try nucleophilic substitution on a cyclopropane ring and this happens.

###### The synthesis of a cockroach pheromone using pericyclic reactions

We fi nish this pair of chapters about pericyclic reactions with a synthesis whose simplicity is
outclassed only by its elegance. Periplanone B is a remarkable bis-epoxide that functions as
the sex pheromone of the American cockroach. Insect sex pheromones often have economic
importance because they can form the key to remarkably effective traps for insect pests.
In 1984, Schreiber published a synthesis of the pheromone in which the majority of steps
involve pericyclic reactions. Make sure you understand each one as it appears—re-read the
appropriate part of Chapter 34 or this chapter if you have any problems. The fi rst step is a
photochemical [2 + 2] cycloaddition. You could not have predicted the regiochemistry, but it

All the carbon atoms in the 12-membered ring are now present, and they are sorted out by

- There are two things to note
here—fi rstly the geometry of
the double bond is nothing to
do with whether the reaction is
conrotatory or disrotatory. As
you know this 4π electron
electrocyclic ring opening must
be conrotatory but as there is no
substituent on the other end of
the diene product we can’t tell.
Secondly notice that in this
12-membered ring a trans
double bond is not only possible
but probably preferred. We
introduced irradiation as a
means of interconverting double
bond isomers in Chapter 27.


The six-membered ring has expanded to a ten-membered ring. Now for a second ringexpansion step—heating the compound to 175 °C makes it undergo electrocyclic ring opening of the four-membered ring, giving the 12-membered ring we want. Or rather not quite—the
new double bond in the ring is formed as a mixture of cis and trans isomers, but irradiation
isomerizes the less stable cis to the more stable trans double bond.

The last two chapters introduced pericyclic reactions, and the next one will cover reactions of radicals. Together with the ionic reactions which have been the subject of most of
this book, these three classes cover all organic mechanisms. But before we move on to consider radicals, we need to fi ll a gap in our coverage of ionic reactions. You have met the most
important types of ionic reactions—additions, substitutions, and eliminations. But two
remain and they are closely related. In rearrangements the molecule changes its carbon skeleton and in fragmentations the carbon skeleton splits into pieces. We lead up to these types
of reaction by looking at a phenomenon known as participation.

###### Neighbouring groups can accelerate substitution reactions

Compare the rates of the following substitution reactions. Each is a substitution of the leaving

Nearby groups can evidently increase the rate of substitution reactions signifi cantly. Now,
you may be thinking back to Chapter 15 and saying ‘yes, yes, we know that’—when we were
discussing the mechanisms of substitution reactions we pointed out that a cation-stabilizing
group at the reaction centre makes SN1 reactions very fast, for example:

**O** **Cl** reacts with nucleophiles 10[6] times faster than **Cl**



- Neighbouring group
participation is occasionally
called anchimeric assistance
(Greek anchi = neighbouring;
mer = part).

**Ph** **Cl** **Cl**

In the four examples above, though, it is not at the reaction centre itself that the functional groups change but at the carbon next to the reaction centre, and we call these groups
_neighbouring groups. The mechanism by which they speed up the reactions is known as_
_neighbouring group participation. Compare the reaction of this ether and this sulfi de with an_
alcohol.

In both cases, ionization of the starting material is assisted by the lone pair of an electronrich functional group. The ether in the fi rst example assists by forming a π bond, the sulfi de
assists by forming a σ bond in a three-membered ring, and a common feature of all mechanisms involving neighbouring group participation is the formation of a cyclic intermediate.

###### Stereochemistry can indicate neighbouring group participation

How do we know that neighbouring group participation is taking place? Well, the fi rst bit of
evidence is the increase in rate. The neighbouring groups become involved only if they can
increase the rate of the substitution reaction—otherwise the mechanism will just follow the
ordinary SN2 pathway. But more important information comes from reactions where stereochemistry is involved, and one of these is the last of the four examples at the start of the
chapter. Here it is again in more detail. Not only does the fi rst of these reactions go faster than
the second—its stereochemical course is different too.

inversion. Again, neighbouring group participation is the reason. To explain this, we should
fi rst draw the six-membered rings in their real conformation. For the anti compound, both
substituents can be equatorial. However, not much can happen in this conformation—but, if
we allow the ring to fl ip, you can see immediately that the acetate substituent is ideally placed
to participate in the departure of the tosylate group.

What results is an entirely symmetrical intermediate—the positive charge on one of the
oxygens is, of course, delocalized over both of them. The intramolecular SN2 reaction takes
place with inversion, as required by the orbitals, so now the junction of the two rings is cis.
The next step is attack of acetic acid on the intermediate. This is another SN2 reaction, which
also proceeds with inversion and gives back a trans product.



- While the mechanism of this
fi rst step of the substitution
reaction is SN2 in appearance—a
nucleophile (the acetate group)
arrives just as a leaving group
(the tosylate group) departs—it
is also, of course, only
unimolecular.

Overall, we have retention of stereochemistry. As you know, SN2 reactions go with inversion
and SN1 reactions with loss of stereochemical information, so this result is possible only if
we have two sequential SN2 reactions taking place—in other words neighbouring group
participation.
Why, then, does the other diastereoisomer react with inversion of stereochemistry? Well,
try drawing the mechanism for intramolecular displacement of the tosyl group. Whether you
put the tosylate or the acetate group equatorial doesn’t matter; there is no way in which the
acetate oxygen’s lone pair can reach the σ* orbital of the tosylate C–O bond.

Neighbouring group participation is impossible, and substitution goes simply by intermolecular displacement of OTs by AcOH. Just one SN2 step means overall inversion of confi guration, and no participation means a slower reaction.

###### Retention of confi guration is an indication of neighbouring group participation

Enantiomerically pure (R)-2-bromopropanoic acid reacts with concentrated sodium hydroxide to give (S)-lactic acid. The reaction goes with inversion and is a typical SN2 reaction—and
a good one too, since the reaction centre is adjacent to a carbonyl group (see Chapter 15). If,
on the other hand, the reaction is run using Ag2O and a low concentration of sodium hydroxide, (R)-lactic acid is obtained—there is overall retention of stereochemistry.

- Lactones (that is, cyclic
esters) don’t usually react with
hydroxide by this mechanism,
and you might expect this
intermediate (which is a cyclic
ester) to hydrolyse by attack of
hydroxide at the C=O group.
You might like to think about
why this doesn’t happen in
this case.


Nucleophilic substitution reactions that go with retention of stereochemistry are rather rare
and mostly go through two successive inversions with neighbouring group participation, like
the example you saw in the last section. This time the neighbouring group is carboxylate: the
silver oxide is important because it encourages the ionization of the starting material by acting as a halogen-selective Lewis acid. A three-membered ring intermediate forms, which then
gets opened by hydroxide in a second SN2 step.

- **Retention suggests participation**

**If you see a substitution reaction at a stereogenic saturated carbon atom that goes with**
**retention of stereochemistry, look for neighbouring group participation!**


Why does the carboxylate group participate only at low HO[−] concentration and in the presence of Ag[+]? You can think of the situation in these two reactions in terms of the factors that
favour SN1 and SN2 reactions. In the fi rst, we have conditions suited to an SN2 reaction: a very
good nucleophile (HO[−]) and a good leaving group (Br[−]). Improve the leaving group by adding
Ag[+] (Ag[+] assists Br [−]’s departure much as H[+] assists the departure of OH[−] by allowing it to leave
as H2O) and worsen the nucleophile (H2O instead of HO[−], of which there is now only a low
concentration), and we have the sorts of conditions that would favour an SN1 reaction. The
trouble is, without neighbouring group participation, the cation here would be rather
un stable—right next to a carbonyl group. The carboxylate saves the day by participating in
the departure of the Br[−] and forming the lactone. The key thing to remember is that a reaction
always goes by the mechanism with the fastest rate.



- **Neighbouring groups participate only if they speed up the reaction.**


###### What sorts of groups can participate?

You’ve already met the most important ones—sulfi des, esters, carboxylates. Ethers and amines
(you will see some of these shortly) can also assist substitution reactions through neighbouring group participation. The important thing that they have in common is an electron-rich
heteroatom with a lone pair that can be used to form the cyclic intermediate. Sulfi des are
rather better than ethers—this sulfi de reacts with water much faster than n-PrCl but the ether
reacts with acetic acid four times more slowly than n-PrOSO2Ar.

Again neighbouring group participation is involved, but this time through a fi ve- rather
than a three-membered ring. Participation is most commonly through three- and fi vemembered rings, less often six-membered ones, and very rarely four- or more than sevenmembered ones.

form particularly rapidly in any

###### Not all participating groups have lone pairs

Another of the four examples we started with shows that even the π electrons of a C=C
double bond can participate. Retention of stereochemistry in the product (the starting
tosylate and product acetate are both anti to the double bond) and the extremely fast reaction (10[11] times that of the saturated analogue) are tell-tale signs of neighbouring group
participation.

###### What is the structure of the intermediate?

During the 1950s and 1960s, this sort of question provoked a prolonged and acrimonious debate, which we have no
intention of stirring up, and all we will do is point out that the intermediate in this reaction is not fully represented by
the structure we have here: it is symmetrical and could be represented by two structures with three-membered rings or
by a delocalized structure in which two electrons are shared between three atoms. The difference need not concern us.

Finally, an example with a neighbouring phenyl group. Participation is suggested by the
retention of relative stereochemistry.

There is a subtlety here that you
should not overlook and that
makes this study, which was carried out by Cram in 1949,
exceedingly elegant. Reactions
of both of these diastereoisomers are stereospecifi c: the
relative stereochemistry of the
products depends on the relative
stereochemistry of the starting
materials. Yet, while the absolute stereochemistry of the starting materials is retained in one
case (we get a single enantiomer of a single diastereoisomer), it is lost in the other
(we get a racemic mixture of
both enantiomers of a single
diastereoisomer). These are
important distinctions, and if you
are in any doubt about these
terms, re-read Chapters 14 and
33. Donald Cram (1919–2001)
of UCLA was awarded the Nobel
prize in 1987 jointly with JeanMarie Lehn (1939–) of
Strasbourg and Paris, and
Charles Pedersen (a Norwegian
born in Korea in 1904) of
DuPont for ‘their development
and use of molecules with structure-specifi c interactions of high
selectivity’.

The phenonium ion is nonetheless still chiral, since it has an axis (and not a plane or
centre) of symmetry, so if we use an enantiomerically pure starting material we get an
enantiomerically pure product.

Not so with the other diastereoisomer of this compound! Now, the phenonium ion is
symmetrical with a plane of symmetry—it is therefore achiral, and the same whichever
enantiomer we start from. Attack on each end of the phenonium ion gives a different
enantiomer, so whichever enantiomer of starting material we use we get the same racemic
mixture of products. You can compare this reaction with the loss of stereochemical information that occurs during an SN1 reaction of enantiomerically pure compounds. Both
reactions pass through an achiral intermediate.

In this case the neighbouring group can be caught in the act—when the rearrangement is
carried out in ethanol, the intermediate is trapped by attack at the central carbon atom. It is

###### Rearrangements occur when a participating group ends up bonded to a different atom

Because the intermediates in these examples are symmetrical, 50% of the time one substituent
ends up moving from one carbon atom to another during the reaction. This is clearer in the
following example: the starting material is prepared such that the carbon atom carrying the
phenyl group is an unusual isotope—carbon-14. This doesn’t affect the chemistry, but means
that the two carbon atoms are easily distinguishable. Reacting the compound with trifl uoroacetic acid scrambles the label between the two positions: the intermediate is symmetrical and,
in the 50% of reactions with the nucleophile that take place at the labelled carbon atom, the
phenyl ends up migrating to the unlabelled carbon atom in a rearrangement reaction.

Now, consider this substitution reaction, in which OH replaces Cl but with a change in the
molecular structure. The substitution goes with complete rearrangement—the amine ends up
attached to a different carbon atom. We can easily see why if we look at the mechanism. The
reaction starts off looking like a neighbouring group participation of the sort you are now
familiar with (the carbon atoms are numbered for identifi cation).



- Labelling an atom with an
unusual isotope is a standard
way to probe the details of a
reaction. Radioactive [3]H (tritium)
or [14]C used to be used but, with
the advent of high-fi eld NMR,
non-radioactive [2]H (deuterium)
and [13]C are more versatile and
less hazardous. These methods
are examined more thoroughly
in Chapter 39.

The intermediate is an aziridinium ion (aziridines are three-membered rings containing

We should just pause here for a moment to consider why this rearrangement works. We start
with a secondary alkyl chloride that contains a very bad leaving group (Et2N) and a good one
(Cl[−])—but the good one is hard for HO[−] to displace because it is at a secondary centre (remember—secondary alkyl halides are slow to react by SN1 or SN2). But the NEt2 can participate to
make an aziridinium intermediate—now there is a good leaving group (RNEt2 without the
negative charge) at the primary as well as the secondary carbon, so HO[−] does a fast SN2 reaction at the primary carbon.

Another way to look at this reaction is to see that the good internal nucleophile Et2N will
compete successfully for the electrophile with the external nucleophile HO[−]. Intramolecular
reactions are usually faster than bimolecular reactions.

The thiolate nucleophile has not opened the epoxide directly, but instead appears to have
displaced HO[−]—a very bad leaving group. Almost no nucleophile will displace OH[−], so we
need an alternative explanation. This comes in the form of another rearrangement, this
time involving oxygen, but otherwise rather similar to the ones you have just met. Again,
our epoxide, although reactive as an electrophile, suffers from being secondary at both
electrophilic centres. t-BuS[−] is a bulky nucleophile, so direct attack on the epoxide is slow.
Instead, under the basic conditions of the reaction, the neighbouring alkoxide group
attacks intramolecularly to make a new, rearranged epoxy alcohol. This is called the Payne
rearrangement.

In the fi rst reaction, the amine migrates from the primary to the secondary position; in the
other from secondary to primary. Both go through very similar aziridinium intermediates, so
the difference must be due to the regioselectivity with which this aziridinium ion opens in
each case.
The only important difference is the nucleophile used in the reaction. Hydroxide opens the
aziridinium at the less hindered end; water opens the aziridinium ion at the more hindered
(more substituted) end. Why?



- When a group migrates from
a primary to a secondary carbon,
we say the rearrangement has a
primary migration origin and
a secondary migration

to the migration terminus.

We can think of the aziridinium ion as a compound containing two alternative leaving
groups—one from a primary centre and one from a secondary one. Primary centres can take
part in fast SN2 reactions, but cannot undergo SN1. Secondary centres can undergo either SN1
or SN2 reactions, but, in general, do neither very well. Now, the rate of an SN2 reaction depends
on the nucleophile, so a good nucleophile (like HO[−]) can do fast SN2 reactions, while a bad one
(like H2O) cannot. The fastest reaction HO[−] can do then is SN2 at the primary centre (remember: you see only the reaction that goes by the fastest mechanism). Water, on the other hand,
takes part only reluctantly in substitution reactions—but this does not matter if they are SN1
reactions because their rates are independent of nucleophile. H2O waits until the leaving
group has left of its own accord to give a cation, which rapidly grabs any nucleophile—water
will do just as well as HO[−]. This can happen only at the secondary centre because the primary
cation is too unstable to form.

All the rearrangements you have met so far occurred during substitution reactions. All happened because reaction with rearrangement is faster than reaction without rearrangement—in
other words, rearrangement occurs because of a kinetic preference for the rearrangement
pathway. You could see these reactions as ‘special case’ examples of neighbouring group participation—in both participation and rearrangement the neighbouring group speeds up the


-----

reaction, but in rearrangement reactions the neighbouring group gets rather more than it
bargained for, and ends up elsewhere in the molecule. Both proceed through a cyclic transition state or intermediate, and it is simply the way in which that transition state or intermediate collapses that determines whether rearrangement occurs.

###### Rearrangement can involve migration of alkyl groups

This example is a nucleophilic substitution under conditions (Ag[+], H2O) designed to encourage SN1 reactions (excellent leaving group, poor nucleophile). First of all, this is what does not
happen (and indeed without Ag[+] _nothing happens at all)._

Compounds like this, with a t-butyl group next to the electrophilic centre, are notoriously
slow to undergo substitution reactions. They can’t do SN2, they are too hindered; they can’t
do SN1, the cation you would get is primary. In fact, a rearrangement occurs. One of the
methyl groups moves (‘migrates’) from carbon 2 to carbon 1, the new OH group taking its
place at carbon 2.

How has this happened? Well, fi rstly, our principle (p. 934) tells us that it has happened
because SN1 and SN2 are both so slow that this new rearrangement mechanism is faster than
either. Adding Ag[+] makes I[−] desperate to leave, but unassisted this would mean the formation
of a primary carbocation. The molecule does the only thing it can to stop this happening and
uses the electrons in an adjacent C–C bond to assist the departure of I[−]. Having participated,
the methyl group continues to migrate to carbon 1 because by doing so it allows the formation
of a stable tertiary carbocation, which then captures water in a step reminiscent of the second
half of an SN1 reaction. Note the cyclic transition state where the migrating group is partially
bonded to two carbon atoms.

you have seen so far
(aziridinium ions, epoxides) are
intermediates; the intermediate
cyclic cation here is probably
only a transition state.

###### Carbocations readily rearrange

In Chapter 15 we showed you that it is possible to run the NMR spectra of carbocations by
using a polar but non-nucleophilic solvent such as liquid SO2 or SOClF. Treating an alkyl
halide RX with the powerful Lewis acid SbF5 under these conditions gives a solution of carbocation: the carbocation reacts neither with solvent nor the SbF5X[−] counterion because
neither is nucleophilic. We know, for example, that the chemical shifts in both the [13]C and

1H NMR spectra of the t-butyl cation are very large, particularly the 13C shift at the positively
charged centre.

NMR can be used to follow the course of rearrangement reactions involving carbocations too.
We can illustrate this with an experiment that tries to make the neopentyl cation by the substitution reaction you have just seen. This time the starting material and solvent are slightly different,
but the outcome is nonetheless most revealing. Dissolving neopentyl tosylate in fl uorosulfonic
acid (a strong, non-nucleophilic acid) at –77°C gives a 77% yield of a cation whose spectrum is
shown below. Assigning the peaks is not hard once you know that the same spectrum is obtained

groups appear as triplets due to
coupling to CH2 through the
empty p orbital.


Clearly, the spectrum is the tertiary 2-methylbutyl cation and the neopentyl cation never
saw the light of day. The reaction is the same rearrangement that you saw in the substitution
reaction of neopentyl iodide, but here the rate of rearrangement can be measured and it is
extremely fast. Neopentyl tosylate reacts to form a cation under these conditions about 10[4]
times as fast as ethyl tosylate, even though both tosylates are primary. This massive rate difference shows that if migration of an alkyl group can allow rearrangement to a more stable
carbocation, it will happen, and happen rapidly.
Primary cations can never be observed by NMR—they are too unstable. But secondary cations can, provided the temperature is kept low enough. sec-Butyl chloride in SO2ClF at –78°C
gives a stable, observable cation. But, as the cation is warmed up, it rearranges to the t-butyl
cation. Now this rearrangement truly is a carbocation rearrangement: the starting material is
an observable carbocation and so is the product, and we should just look at the mechanism in
a little more detail.

With rearrangements like this it is best to number the C atoms so you can see clearly what
moves where. If we do this, we see that the methyl group we have labelled 4 and the H on C3
have changed places. (Note that C3 starts off as a CH2 group and ends up as CH3.)

- The reason we say ‘truly is a
carbocation rearrangement’ here
is quite subtle and need not
detain us long. We know that a
secondary cation is formed in
this case because we can see it
by NMR; it subsequently
rearranges to a tertiary cation.
As we can never see primary
cations, we don’t know that
they are ever formed, and the
most reasonable explanation for
rearrangements of the type you
saw on p. 937 is that migration
of the alkyl group begins before
the leaving group is fully gone.
This has been proved in a few
cases, but we will from now on
not distinguish between the two
alternatives.

**Number the carbon atoms in the starting material and product before you try to work out the**

Using the sort of arrows we introduced on p. 940, we can draw a mechanism for this in
which fi rst the Me migrates, and then the hydride. We say hydride migration rather than
_hydrogen (or proton) because the H atom migrates with its pair of electrons._

As these rearrangements are a new type of reaction, we should just spend a moment looking
at the molecular orbitals that are involved. For the fi rst step, migration of the methyl group,


-----

the LUMO must clearly be the empty p orbital of the cation, and the HOMO is the C–C σ
bond, which is about to break.

The methyl group can slide smoothly from one orbital to another—there are bonding interactions all the way. The next step, migration of H, is just the same—except that the HOMO is
now a C–H σ bond. The methyl migration is thermodynamically unfavourable as it transforms a secondary cation into an unstable primary cation but the hydride migration puts that
right as it gives a stable tertiary cation. The whole reaction is under thermodynamic control.

###### Wagner–Meerwein rearrangements

Carbocation rearrangements involving migration of H or alkyl groups don’t just happen in
NMR machines. They happen during normal reactions too. For example, acid-catalysed
de hydration of the natural product camphenilol gives the alkene santene (a key component
of the fragrance of sandalwood oil) in a reaction involving migration of a methyl group.

The mechanism shows why the rearrangement happens: the fi rst-formed cation cannot
eliminate H[+] in an E1 reaction because loss of the only available proton would give a very
strained bridgehead alkene (make a model and see!).

However, migration of a methyl group both stabilizes the cation—it becomes tertiary

The migration of an alkyl group to a cationic centre is known as a Wagner–Meerwein
re arrangement or Wagner–Meerwein shift, and this migration is, of course, a synthetic manifestation of the rearrangement we have just been looking at in NMR spectra. Wagner–Meerwein shifts
have been studied extensively in the class of natural products to which both of these natural
products belong—terpenes. For the moment, though, we will just illustrate this type of reaction
with one more example—another acid-catalysed dehydration, of isoborneol to give camphene.

**HO**

This one seems much more complicated—but, in fact, only one alkyl migration is involved.
To see what has happened, remember the ‘top tip’—number the carbons. You can number the
starting material any way you choose—we’ve started with the gem-dimethyl group because it
will be easy to spot in the product. The numbers just follow round the ring, with C8 being the
methyl group attached to C5.
Now for the hard bit—we need to work out which carbon in the starting material becomes
which carbon in the product. The best thing is just to have a go—mistakes will soon become
obvious and you can always try again.

 - Use the substituents to help you—some will have changed, but most will be the same or
similar, for example C1 is still easy to spot as the carbon carrying the dimethyl group.

 - Use connectivity to help you—again, a C–C bond or two may have broken or formed,
but most of the C–C bonds in the starting material will be there in the product. C1
and C2 will probably still be next door to one another—C2 was a bridgehead carbon
in the starting material, and there is a bridgehead C attached to C1 in the product;
assume that’s C2.

 - C3 and C4 were unsubstituted carbons in the starting material, and are identifi able
in the product too. The other easily spotted atom is C7—an unsubstituted C
attached to C2.

 - C5, C6, and C8 are harder. We can assume that C8 is the =CH2 carbon—it was a
methyl group but perhaps has become involved in an elimination. C5 was attached to
C1, C4, C6, and C8: one of the remaining carbons is attached to C1 and C8, so that
seems more likely to be C5, which leaves C6 as the bridgehead, attached as before to
C7 and C5.

Now we have the whole picture and we can assess what has happened in the reaction—
which old bonds have broken and which new bonds have formed.

Numbering the atoms this way identifi es the likely point of rearrangement—the only bond
broken is between C4 and C5. Instead we have a new one between C4 and C6: C4 appears to
have migrated from C5 to C6.
Now for the mechanism. The fi rst step will, of course, be loss of water to generate a secondary
cation at C6. The cation is next to a quaternary centre, and migration of any of three bonds
could generate a more stable tertiary carbocation. But we know that the new bond in the product is between C4 and C6, so let’s migrate carbon 4. Manipulating the diagrams a bit turns up
a structure remarkably similar to our product, and all we need to do is lose a proton from C8.

- If you are observant, you
may ask why the alkyl group
migrated in this example and
not the methyl group, or the
other alkyl group—all three
possibilities give similar tertiary
carbocations. The reason
involves the alignment of the
orbitals involved, which we will
discuss at the end of the
chapter.


Although migration of an alkyl group that forms part of a ring leads to much more signifi cant changes in structure than simple migration of a methyl group, the reason why it happens
is still just the same.


###### Ring expansion means rearrangement

‘More stable’ usually means ‘more substituted’, but cations can also be made more stable if they
become _less strained. So, for example, four-membered rings adjacent to cations readily_
re arrange to fi ve-membered rings in order to relieve ring strain.

 - **Alkyl migrations occur in order to make a carbocation more stable.**


This time the cation is formed by protonation of an alkene, not departure of a leaving group,

Although the rearrangement step transforms a stable tertiary cation into a less stable secondary cation, relief of strain in expansion from a four- to a fi ve-membered ring makes the
alkyl migration favourable. A synthesis of the natural product α-caryophyllene alcohol makes
use of a similar ring expansion. Notice the photochemical [2 + 2] cycloaddition (Chapter 34)

As usual, numbering the atoms makes clear what has happened: carbon 7 has migrated from
carbon 6 to carbon 5. Loss of water gives a tertiary carbocation that undergoes rearrangement
to a secondary carbocation with expansion of a four- to a fi ve-membered ring.

###### Carbocation rearrangements: blessing or curse?

Well, that depends. You have now seen a few useful carbocation rearrangements that give
single products in high yield. But you have also met at least one reaction that cannot be done
because of carbocation rearrangements: as we mentioned in Chapter 15, Friedel–Crafts
alkylation using primary alkyl halides leads to products derived from rearranged cations. The
alkylation in the margin illustrates the problems of trying to use carbocation rearrangements
to make single products in high yield. We can give three guidelines to spotting this type of
reaction.

**1.** The rearrangement must be fast so that other reactions do not compete.

**2.** The product cation must be suffi ciently more stable than the starting one so that the
rearrangement happens in high yield.

**3.** Subsequent trapping of the product cation must be reliable: cations are high-energy
intermediates, and are therefore unselective about how they react.

A reaction is no good if the cation reacts in more than one way—it may react with a nucleophile, eliminate, or undergo further rearrangement—but it must do only one of these! For the
rest of the chapter, we will address only reactions that, unlike this Friedel–Crafts reaction, follow these guidelines. The reactions we will talk about all happen in good yield.

###### The pinacol rearrangement

When the 1,2-diol pinacol is treated with acid, a rearrangement takes place.

Whenever you see a rearrangement, especially in acid, you should now think ‘carbocation’.
Here, protonation of one of the hydroxyl groups allows it to leave as water, giving the
carbocation.



- Pinacol, the trivial name for
the starting material, which is
made from acetone by a
reaction you will meet in
Chapter 37, gives its name to
this class of rearrangements,
and to the product, ‘pinacolone’.

You now know that carbocations rearrange by alkyl shifts to get as stable as they can be—
but this carbocation is already tertiary, and there is no ring strain, so why should it re arrange?
Well, here we have another source of electrons to stabilize the carbocation: lone pairs on an
oxygen atom. We pointed out early in the chapter that oxygen is very good at stabilizing a
positive charge on an adjacent atom, and somewhat less good at stabilizing a positive charge
two atoms away. By rearranging, the fi rst-formed carbocation gets the positive charge into a
position where the oxygen can stabilize it, and loss of a proton from oxygen then gives a
stable ketone.

You can view the pinacol as a rearrangement with a ‘push’ and a ‘pull’. The carbocation left
by the departure of water ‘pulls’ the migrating group across at the same time as the oxygen’s
lone pair ‘pushes’ it. A particularly valuable type of pinacol rearrangement forms spirocyclic
ring systems. You may fi nd this one harder to follow, although the mechanism is identical
with that of the last example. Our ‘top tip’ of numbering the atoms should help you to see
what has happened: atom 2 has migrated from atom 1 to atom 6.

- Of course, it doesn’t matter
how you number the atoms, but
the numbering must be
consistent. Usually, your initial
impression of a greatly changed
molecule will come down to just
one or two atoms changing their
substitution pattern, and
numbering will help you to work
out which ones they are.


When drawing the mechanism it doesn’t matter which hydroxyl group you protonate or
which adjacent C–C bond migrates—they are all the same. One fi ve-membered ring expands
to a six-membered ring but the reason this reaction happens is the formation of a carbonyl
group, as in all pinacol rearrangements.

###### Epoxides rearrange with Lewis acids in a pinacol fashion

The intermediate cation in a pinacol rearrangement can equally well be formed from an epoxide, and treating epoxides with acid, including Lewis acids such as MgBr2, promotes the same

The alkyllithium reaction is quite straightforward as long as the alkyllithium is free of

that treating this epoxide with just MgBr2 (not RMgBr) gives an aldehyde.

With a Grignard reagent, rearrangement occurs faster than addition to the epoxide, and

###### Some pinacol rearrangements have a choice of migrating group

With these symmetrical diols and epoxides, it does not matter which hydroxyl group is
proton ated and leaves, nor which end the epoxide opens, nor which group migrates. When
an unsymmetrical diol or epoxide rearranges, it is important which way the reaction goes.
Usually, the reaction leaves behind the more stable cation. So, for example, this unsymmetrical diol gives the ring-expanded ketone, a starting material for the synthesis of analogues of
the drug methadone.

Most unsymmetrical diols or epoxides give mixtures of products on rearrangement. The
problem is that there is a choice of two leaving groups and two alternative rearrangement
directions, and only for certain substitution patterns is the choice clear-cut.

The reaction needed for the last stage is a pinacol rearrangement—the _primary hydroxyl_

carbocation.

The solution to this problem is to force the primary hydroxyl group to be the leaving group
by making it into a tosylate. The primary hydroxyl group reacts more rapidly with TsCl than
the tertiary one because it is less hindered. A weak base is now all that is needed to make the
compound rearrange in what is known as a semipinacol rearrangement.

Semipinacol rearrangements are rearrangements in which a hydroxyl group provides the
electrons to ‘push’ the migrating group across, but the ‘pull’ comes from the departure of leaving groups other than water—tosylate in this example, but typically also halide or nitrogen
(N2). Since tosylation occurs at the less hindered hydroxyl group of a diol, not only can semipinacol rearrangements be more regioselective than pinacol rearrangements, but their regioselectivity may be in the opposite direction.

Corey exploited this in a synthesis of the natural product longifolene. He needed to persuade an easily made 6,6-fused ring system to undergo rearrangement to a ring-expanded
ketone. Again, a normal acid-catalysed pinacol rearrangement is no good—the tertiary, allylic
hydroxyl group is much more likely to ionize, and the acid-sensitive protecting group would
be hydrolysed too. Tosylation of the secondary alcohol in the presence of the tertiary is possible, and semipinacol rearrangement gives the required ketone.

- Treating 2-halo alcohols with
base is, of course, a good way
to make epoxides. Using AgNO3
to improve iodide’s leaving
ability without increasing the
nucleophilicity of the hydroxyl
group favours rearrangement at
the expense of epoxide
formation. There would certainly
be a danger of epoxide
formation in strong base.


The leaving group need not be tosylate: in the following example, part of a synthesis of
bergamotene (a component of valerian root oil and the aroma of Earl Grey tea), a 2-iodo alcohol rearranges.

While alkyldiazonium salts are unstable, their conjugate bases, diazoalkanes, are stable
enough to be prepared and are nucleophilic towards carbonyl compounds. Diazoalkanes are
neutral compounds having one fewer proton than diazonium salts, and are delocalized structures with a central sp nitrogen atom.
When diazomethane (a compound we will investigate in more detail in Chapter 38) adds to
a ketone, the product undergoes a ring expansion by rearrangement of the same type of

The problem with reactions like this is that both the starting material and product are
ketones, so they work cleanly only if the starting material is more reactive than the product.
Cyclohexanone is more reactive as an electrophile than either cyclopentanone or cycloheptanone, so it ring expands cleanly to cycloheptanone. But expansion of cyclopentanone to
cyclohexanone is messy and gives a mixture of products.

This type of rearrangement is known helpfully as a dienone-phenol rearrangement, and we
can consider it quite simply as a type of _reverse pinacol rearrangement. Pinacol and semi-_
pinacol rearrangements are driven by the formation of a carbonyl group. The rearranged
cation is stabilized by being next to oxygen and it can rapidly lose H[+] to give a carbonyl compound. In the key step of a dienone-phenol rearrangement, a protonated carbonyl compound
rearranges to a tertiary carbocation. The reaction is driven from dienone to phenol because
the product cation can rapidly undergo elimination of H[+] to become aromatic.

###### The benzilic acid rearrangement


You have seen rearrangements in which carbonyl groups form at the migration origin: the
migrating group in the pinacol and semipinacol rearrangements is ‘pushed’ by the oxygen’s
lone pair as it forms the new carbonyl group. You have also seen carbonyl groups being
destroyed at the migration terminus: the migrating group in the dienone-phenol rearrangement is ‘pulled’ towards the protonated carbonyl group. The fi rst rearrangement reaction ever
to be described has both of these at once.

hydroxide gave, after acid quench, 2-hydroxy-2,2-diphenylacetic acid, which he called
‘benzilic acid’. The mechanism of this benzilic acid rearrangement starts with attack of
hydroxide on one of the carbonyl groups. The tetrahedral intermediate can collapse in a
reaction reminiscent of a semipinacol rearrangement.

###### The Favorskii rearrangement

We hope you have appreciated the smooth mechanistic progression so far in this chapter,
from Wagner–Meerwein to pinacol and semipinacol through dienone-phenol to benzilic acid.

Our aim is to help you gain an overall view of the types of rearrangements that take place (and
why) and not to present you with lots of disconnected facts. It is at this point, however, that
our mechanistic journey takes a hairpin bend. The bend comes as a surprise because when we
show you the next rearrangement, the Favorskii, you would be forgiven for thinking that
surely it’s just a variant of the benzilic acid rearrangement?

Well, this is what chemists thought until 1944, when some American chemists found that
two isomeric α-chloro ketones gave exactly the same product on treatment with methoxide.
They suggested that both reactions went through the same intermediate.

That intermediate is a three-membered cyclic ketone, a cyclopropanone: the alkoxide acts
not as a nucleophile (its role in the benzilic acid rearrangement) but as a base, enolizing the
ketone. The enolate can alkylate itself intramolecularly in a reaction that looks bizarre but
that many chemists think is not unreasonable. The intermediate is the same cyclopropanone
in each case.

There is also a pericyclic mechanism for the ring-closure step. The enolate simply loses chloride to give an ‘oxyallyl cation’—a dipolar species with an oxyanion and a delocalized allylic
cation. This species can cyclize in a two-electron disrotatory electrocyclic reaction (Chapter
35) to give the same cyclopropanone.

Cyclopropanones are very reactive towards nucleophiles, and the tetrahedral intermediate
arising from the attack of methoxide springs open to give the ester product. The more stable
carbanion leaves: although the carbanion is not actually formed as a free species, there must
be considerable negative charge at the carbon atom as the three-membered ring opens. Here
the benzyl group is the better leaving group.


Cyclopropanones and cyclobutanones are very reactive,
rather like epoxides, because,
while the 60° or 90° angle in the
ring is nowhere near the tetrahedral angle (108°), it is nearer
108° than the 120° preferred by
the sp[2] C of the C=O group.
Conversely, the small ring
ketones are resistant to enolization because that would place
two sp[2] carbon atoms in the ring.

Favorskii rearrangement of cyclic 2-bromoketones leads to ring contraction and this has
become one of the most fruitful uses of the rearrangement in synthesis. Bromination of
cyclohexanone (Chapter 20) and treatment with methoxide gives the methyl ester of cyclopentane carboxylic acid in good yield.

Enolization occurs on the side of the ketone away from the bromine atom and the enolate cyclizes as before but the cyclopropanone intermediate is symmetrical so that the
product is the same whichever C– C bond breaks after nucleophilic attack by the methoxide ion.

The overall consequence of the Favorskii rearrangement is that an alkyl group is transferred
from one side of a carbonyl group to the other. This means that it can be used to build up
heavily branched esters and carboxylic acids—the sort that are hard to make by alkylation
(Chapter 25) because of the problems of hindered enolates and unreactive secondary alkyl
halides. Heavily substituted acids, where CO2H is attached to a tertiary carbon atom, would be
hard to make by any other method.

The Favorskii rearrangement is also a key step in the synthesis of the powerful obstetric
painkiller pethidine. But try writing a mechanism for this last reaction and you run into
a problem—there are no acidic protons so the ketone cannot be enolized! Yet the Favorskii
rearrangement still works. Despite our warnings against confusing the mechanisms of
the Favorskii and benzilic acid rearrangements, the Favorskii rearrangement may, in
fact, follow a benzilic-type rearrangement mechanism, if there are no acidic hydrogens
available.

###### Migration to oxygen: the Baeyer–Villiger reaction

In 1899, two Germans, A. Baeyer and V. Villiger, found that treating a ketone with a peracid
(RCO3H) can produce an ester. An oxygen atom is ‘inserted’ next to the carbonyl group. You
saw a similar ‘insertion’ reaction earlier in the chapter, and the mechanism here is not
dissimilar.

- You have seen peracids used
to make epoxides (Chapter 19);
this is another important
application.


**RCO3H** **CH2N2**


**CH2**


Both peracids and diazomethane contain a nucleophilic centre that carries a good leaving
group, and addition of peracid to the carbonyl group gives a structure that should remind you
of a semipinacol intermediate with one of the carbon atoms replaced by oxygen.

Baeyer–Villiger reactions are among the most useful of all rearrangement reactions, and the
most common reagent is m-CPBA (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid) because it is commercially
available.

###### Which group migrates? (I): the facts

A question we have deliberately avoided up to this point is this: when there is a competition
between two migrating groups, which group migrates? This question arises in pinacol, semipinacol, and dienone-phenol rearrangements and in Baeyer–Villiger reactions (in the benzilic
acid and Favorskii rearrangements, there is no choice) and the awkward fact is that the answer
is different in each case! However, let’s start with the Baeyer–Villiger reaction because here the
question is always valid except when the ketone being oxidized is symmetrical. Here are some
examples; you can probably begin to draw up guidelines for yourself.

The order, with tert-alkyl the best at migrating, then sec-alkyl closely followed by Ph, then
Et, then Me, very roughly follows the order in which the groups are able to stabilize a positive
charge. Primary groups are much more reluctant to undergo migration than secondary ones
or aryl groups, and this makes regioselective Baeyer–Villiger reactions possible.

The Baeyer–Villiger reaction has solved a regioselectivity problem here. L-tyrosine, a relatively cheap amino acid, can be converted to the important drug L-dopa provided it can be
hydroxylated ortho to the OH group. This is where electrophilic substitutions of the phenol
take place, but electrophilic substitutions with ‘HO[+]’ are not possible. However, after a Friedel–
Crafts acylation, the acyl group can be converted to hydroxyl by the Baeyer–Villiger reaction
and hydrolysis. The Baeyer–Villiger reaction means that MeCO[+] can be used as a synthetic
equivalent for ‘HO[+]’. Note the unusual use of the less reactive H2O2 as oxidizing agent in this
reaction. This is possible only when the migrating group is an electron-rich aromatic ring;
these reactions are sometimes called Dakin reactions.

###### Unsaturated ketones may epoxidize or undergo Baeyer–Villiger rearrangement

Peracids may epoxidize alkenes faster than ketones take part in Baeyer–Villiger reactions, so
unsaturated ketones are not often good substrates for Baeyer–Villiger reactions. The balance is
rather delicate. The two factors that matter are: how electrophilic is the ketone and how nucleo_philic is the alkene? You might like to consider why this reaction does work, and why the C=C_
double bond here is particularly unreactive.

One point to note about both of the last two reactions is that the insertion of oxygen goes
with retention of stereochemistry. You may think this is unsurprising in a cyclic system like
this and, indeed, the fi rst of the two cannot possibly go with inversion. However, this is a
general feature of Baeyer–Villiger reactions, even when inversion would give a more stable
product.

By looking at the orbitals involved, you can see why this must be so. The sp[3] orbital of the
migrating carbon just slips from one orbital to the next with the minimum amount of structural reorganization. The large lobe of the sp[3] orbital is used so the new bond forms to the same
face of the migrating group as the old one, and stereochemistry is retained.

The orbital interactions in all 1,2-migrations are similar, and the migrating group retains its
stereochemistry in these too. In the more familiar SN2 reaction, inversion occurs because the
antibonding σ* orbital rather than the bonding σ orbital is used. In the SN2 reaction, carbon
undergoes nucleophilic attack with inversion; in rearrangements the migrating carbon atom
undergoes electrophilic attack with retention of confi guration.



- **In 1,2-migrations, the migrating group retains its stereochemistry.**


###### Which group migrates? (II): the reasons

Why does the more substituted group migrate in the Baeyer–Villiger reaction? The transition
state has a positive charge spread out over the molecule as the carboxylate leaves as an anion.
If the migrating group can take some responsibility for the positive charge the transition state
will be more stable. The more stable the charge, the faster the rearrangement.

When a benzene ring migrates, π participation is involved as the benzene ring acts as a
nucleophile and the positive charge can be spread out even further. Note that the Ph is
stabilizing the charge here in the way that it stabilizes the intermediate in an electrophilic
aromatic substitution reaction—like a pentadienyl cation rather than like a benzylic cation. What was a transition state in alkyl migration becomes an intermediate in phenyl
migration.

The situation in other rearrangements is much more complicated—and indeed more
complicated than many textbooks would have you believe. We shall look just briefl y at the
di enone-phenol rearrangement again, this time considering reactions in which there is competition between two different migrating groups. As in the Baeyer–Villiger reaction, the transition state is cationic, so you would expect cation-stabilizing groups to migrate more readily.
This appears to be true for Ph versus Me, but is most defi nitely not true for Ph versus CO2Et.
The cation destabilizing group CO2Et migrates even though Ph is much better at stabilizing a
positive charge!

The reason is that CO2Et is so cation destabilizing that it prefers to migrate rather than be left

that does not migrate that matters most.

###### Which group migrates? (III): stereochemistry matters too

Selectivity in rearrangement reactions is affected by the electronic nature of both the group
that migrates and the group that is left behind. But there is more! Stereochemistry is important
too. The outcome of diazotization and semipinacol rearrangement (Tiffeneau–Demjanov


-----

rearrangement, p. 949) of this amino-alcohol depends entirely on the diastereoisomer you
start with. There are four diastereoisomers, and we have drawn each one in the only conformation it can reasonably adopt, with the t-butyl group equatorial.

In all of these reactions, the OH group provides the electronic ‘push’. In the fi rst two reactions, the ring contracts by an alkyl migration from the secondary alcohol, while in the third

The only difference between the compounds is stereochemistry and, if we look at the orbitals involved in the reactions, we can see why this is so important. As the N2 leaving group
departs, electrons in the bond to the migrating group have to fl ow into the C–N σ* orbital—
we discussed this on p. 949. But what we didn’t talk about then was the fact that best overlap
between these two orbitals (σ and σ*) occurs if they are anti-periplanar to one another—just
as in an E2 elimination reaction.

For the fi rst two compounds, with the –N2+ group equatorial, the group best placed to migrate
is the alkyl group that forms the ring; for the third reaction, there is a hydrogen atom antiperiplanar to the leaving group, so H migrates.

The fourth reaction has, rather than a group that might migrate, the hydroxyl group ideally

-----

The requirement for the migrating group to be anti-periplanar to the leaving group is quite
general in rearrangement reactions. The reason we haven’t noticed its effect before is that most
of the compounds we have considered have not been conformationally constrained in the way
that these are. Free rotation means that the right geometry for rearrangement is always obtainable—stereochemistry is not a factor in the Baeyer–Villiger reaction, for example. We will come
back to some more aspects of stereochemical control later in the chapter, when we deal with
fragmentation reactions. Before then, we will consider one last rearrangement reaction, in
which stereochemistry again plays an important controlling role.

###### The Beckmann rearrangement

The industrial manufacture of nylon relies on the alkaline polymerization of a cyclic amide
known trivially as caprolactam. Caprolactam can be produced by the action of sulfuric acid on
the oxime of cyclohexanone in a rearrangement known as the Beckmann rearrangement.

The mechanism of the Beckman rearrangement follows the same pattern as a pinacol or
Baeyer–Villiger reaction: acid converts the oxime OH into a leaving group, and an alkyl group
migrates to nitrogen as water departs. The product cation is then trapped by water to give an
amide.

This rearrangement is not confi ned to cyclic oximes, and other ways of converting OH to

acyclic Beckmann rearrangement, the product cation is better represented as this nitrilium
ion. When we write the mechanism we can then involve the nitrogen’s lone pair to ‘push’ the
migrating group back on to N.

###### Which group migrates in the Beckmann rearrangement?

In the Beckmann rearrangement of unsymmetrical ketones there are two groups that could
migrate. There are also two possible geometrical isomers of an unsymmetrical oxime: C=N
double bonds can exhibit cis/trans isomerism just as C=C double bonds can. When mixtures
of geometrical isomers of oximes are rearranged, mixtures of products result, but the ratio of
products mirrors exactly the ratio of geometrical isomers in the starting materials—the group
that has migrated is in each case the group trans to the OH in the starting material.

We have already touched on the idea that, for migration to occur, a migrating group has to
be able to interact with the σ* of the bond to the leaving group, and this is the reason for the
specifi city here. In the example a couple of pages back the stereospecifi city of the reaction was
due to the starting material being constrained in a conformationally rigid ring. Here it is the
C=N double bond that provides the constraint. If one of the alkyl chains is branched, more of
the oxime with the OH group anti to that chain will be formed and correspondingly more of
the branched group will migrate.

Conditions that allow those double bond isomers to interconvert can allow either group to
migrate— which one does so will then be decided, as in the Baeyer–Villiger reaction, by electronic factors. Most protic acids allow the oxime isomers to equilibrate, so, for example, this
tosylated oxime rearranges with full stereospecifi city in Al2O3 (the anti methyl group migrates),
but with TsOH, equilibration of the oxime geometrical isomers means that either group could
migrate—in the event, the propyl group (which is more able to support a positive charge)
migrates faster.

Notice that the effect of the Beckmann rearrangement is to insert a nitrogen atom next to the

diazoalkane carbon insertion.

###### The Beckmann fragmentation

To introduce the theme of the last section of this chapter, a Beckmann rearrangement that is
not all that it seems. t-Butyl groups migrate well in the Baeyer–Villiger reaction and, indeed,
Beckmann rearrangement of the compound in the margin appears to be quite normal too.
But, when this compound and another compound with a tertiary centre next to the oxime are
mixed together and treated with acid, it becomes apparent that what is happening is not an
intramolecular reaction.

Each migrating tertiary group must have lost contact with the amide fragment it started
out with. The molecule must fall apart to give a t-alkyl cation and a nitrile: the Beckmann
re arrangement now goes via a fragmentation mechanism.



- The recombination step of
this reaction is really just a
Ritter reaction: reaction of a
nitrile with a carbocation. You
came across the Ritter reaction

Beckmann rearrangements that
go with fragmentation are
sometimes called ‘anomalous’ or
‘second-order’ Beckmann rearrangements. You should not use
the second of these names and,
in any case, Beckmann frag**mentation is much better than**
either.


Migrating groups have to provide some degree of cation stabilization. But if they stabilize a
cation too well there is a good chance that fragmentation will occur and the ‘migrating group’
will be lost as a carbocation.
Here is a more convincing example of the same fragmentation reaction: the conditions, but
not the results, are those of a Beckmann rearrangement. In this reaction, the ring structure
means the cation cannot be trapped by the nitrile, and a fragmentation product is isolated.

###### Polarization of C–C bonds helps fragmentation

Up to now, you have met few fragmentation reactions—reactions in which C–C bonds
are broken—largely because the C–C bond is so strong. Why then does the Beckmann


-----

fragmentation work? Well, the reason C–C bonds are hard to break is not just because of their
strength, as the table of bond energies indicates.
For both carbon and hydrogen, a bond to oxygen is stronger than a bond to carbon. Yet we
have no hesitation in breaking O–H bonds (of, say, carboxylic acids) with even the weakest of
bases and we have spent much of this chapter showing C–O bonds of protonated alcohols
rupturing spontaneously! What is going on?
The answer is polarization. Oxygen’s electronegativity means that C–O and O–H bonds
are polarized and are easy to break with hard nucleophiles and bases; C–C and C–H bonds are
(usually) not polarized and, although weaker, are harder to break. It follows that to break a
C–C bond it helps a lot if it is polarized—there needs to be a source of electrons at one end
and an electron ‘sink’ (into which they can fl ow) at the other.

###### Fragmentations require electron push and electron pull

Fragmentations are reactions in which the molecule breaks open by the cleavage of a C–C
single bond, and we start this section with some examples. Both diastereoisomers of this

homolytic fragmentation in
much more detail in the next
chapter.


Numbering the atoms shows which bond fragments—now we need to provide a source and
a sink for the electrons to polarize the bond. Protonation of a hydroxyl group provides the
sink—it can now leave as water. And the lone pair of the other oxygen provides the source.
You can think of the electrons in the C–C bond being ‘pushed’ by the oxygen’s lone pair and
‘pulled’ by the departing water—until the bond breaks. A bit of extra impetus comes from
release of ring strain: C–C bonds in three- and four-membered rings are weaker than usual
(by about 120 kJ mol[−][1]).

We talked about ‘pushing’ and ‘pulling’ electrons when we introduced the pinacol

Protonated carbonyl compounds can be electron sinks too (remember the dienone-phenol

Analysing the Beckmann fragmentation on p. 960 in the same way, we can identify the
electron sink (the departing acetate group), although the source in this case is a little more
obscure. Saying that the tertiary cation is stable is really saying that the neighbouring C–C
and C–H bonds provide electrons (through σ conjugation, see p. 334) to stabilize it, so these
are the electron sources (the ‘push’). A good alternative is to write loss of a proton concerted
with fragmentation, which gives one particular C–H bond as the source of electrons.

###### Fragmentations are controlled by stereochemistry

The control of rearrangements can be stereoelectronic in origin—if a molecule is to rearrange,
orbitals have to be able to overlap. This means that, for a Beckmann rearrangement, the migrating group has to be trans to the leaving group. Not surprisingly, the same is true for Beckmann
fragmentations like the one at the end of the last section, where the green fragmenting bond
is trans to the leaving group. Before we extend these ideas any further, consider these two
quite different reactions of quite similar compounds.

Just as with the rearrangements we looked at on p. 933, we need to draw these compounds in
reasonable chair conformations in order to understand what is going on. In the cis isomer, both
substituents can be equatorial; in the trans isomer one has to be axial, and this will be mainly
the OTs group, since the two methyl groups of NMe2 suffer greater 1,3-diaxial interactions.

Now, the cis isomer has clearly undergone a fragmentation reaction and, as usual, numbering the atoms can help to identify the bond that breaks. The nitrogen lone pair pushes, the
departing tosylate pulls, and the resulting iminium ion hydrolyses to the product aldehyde.

Yet the trans isomer does this only in very low yield. Mostly it eliminates TsOH to give a
mixture of alkenes. Why? Well, notice that, in the cis isomer, the fragmenting bond is trans to
the leaving group—indeed, it is both parallel and trans (in other words anti-periplanar) to the
leaving group. Electrons can fl ow smoothly from the breaking σ bond into the σ* of the C–
OTs bond, forming as they do so a new π bond.

For the _trans isomer, fragmentation of the most populated conformation is impossible_
because the leaving group is not anti-periplanar to any C–C bond. The only bonds anti-periplanar to OTs are C–H bonds, making this compound ideally set up for another reaction
whose requirement for anti-periplanarity you have already met—E2 elimination.

Ring sizes greater than eight are hard to make. Yet fi ve- and six-membered rings are easy to
make. Once you realize that a fused pair of six-membered rings is really a ten-membered ring
with a bond across the middle, the potential for making medium rings by fragmentation
becomes apparent.

All you need to do is to make the bond to be broken the 2–3 bond in a 1, 2, 3, 4 electron

the fragmentation. Here is an example:

This is the simple overall result, but there is more to explore. The starting hydroxytosylate
can exist as four diastereoisomers: two trans-decalins and two cis-decalins. What is more, the
product has a double bond in a ten-membered ring: will it be cis or trans? (Both are possible in
a ring with more than eight members: see Chapter 29.) One of the four diastereoisomers of the
starting material cannot place the tosylate anti-periplanar to the ring-fusion bond, so it can’t
fragment. The other three diastereoisomers all can, but two of them give a trans double bond
while the third gives cis.

Looking at the alignment of the bonds that end up fl anking the double bond in the product
shows you where the geometrical isomers come from: these are the black bonds in the starting
material, and are trans across the forming π system in the fi rst two isomers and cis in the third.
Fragmentations are stereospecifi c with regard to double-bond geometry, much as E2 elimination reactions are.

###### Caryophyllene by fragmentation

Corey applied this stereospecifi city in conjunction with a ring expansion reaction to make the natural product caryophyllene.
Caryophyllene is a bicyclic molecule with a nine-membered ring containing an E trisubstituted double bond. The right relative stereochemistry in the starting material leads both to fragmentation of the right bond and to formation of the alkene
with the right stereochemistry.

 The Eschenmoser fragmentation

In the late 1960s, the Swiss chemist Albert Eschenmoser discovered an important reaction that
can be used to achieve similar ring expansions and that now bears his name, the Eschenmoser
fragmentation. The starting material for an Eschenmoser fragmentation is the epoxide of an
α,β-unsaturated ketone. The fragmentation happens when this epoxyketone is treated with
tosylhydrazine, and one of the remarkable things about the product is that it is an alkyne. The
fragmentation happens across the epoxide (shown in black), and the product contains both a
ketone (in a different place from the ketone in the starting material) and an alkyne. You can see
how in this case hydrogenation of the triple bond can give muscone (R=Me) or exaltone (R=H).

The Eschenmoser fragmentation does not have to be a ring expansion, and it is a useful
synthetic method for making keto-alkynes. The following reaction, which we will use to discuss the fragmentation’s mechanism, was used to make an intermediate in the synthesis of an
insect pheromone, exo-brevicomin.


Albert Eschenmoser (1925–),
working at the ETH in Zurich,
synthesized vitamin B12, at the
time (1973) the most complicated molecule yet made, in
what was for that era an
un usual international collaboration with Woodward at Harvard.

The reaction starts with formation of the tosylhydrazone from the epoxyketone. The tosylhydrazone is unstable with respect to opening of the epoxide in an elimination reaction, and
it is this elimination that sets up the familiar 1, 2, 3, 4 system ready for fragmentation. The
‘push’ comes from the newly created hydroxyl group, and the ‘pull’ from the irresistible concerted loss of a good leaving group (Ts[−]) and an even better one (N2). Notice how all the (green)
bonds that break are parallel to one another, held anti-periplanar by two double bonds. Perfect!

Juvenile hormone (a compound you met in Chapter 27, p. 677) is a compound whose synthesis
presents a major challenge: it requires the control of three trisubstituted double bonds (one of
which ends up as an epoxide). The key intermediate shown contains two of them.

The chemists who succeeded in making this compound reasoned that, if this intermediate
could be made stereospecifi cally by fragmenting a cyclic starting material, the (hard-tocontrol) double-bond stereochemistry would derive directly from the (easier-to-control) relative stereochemistry of the cyclic compound. The starting material they chose was a 5,6-fused
system, which fragments to give one of the double bonds.

###### The synthesis of nootkatone: fragmentation showcase

To fi nish this chapter, we will present three different synthetic routes to the same compound, all of which illustrate the power of fragmentation in the synthesis of cyclic compounds. The story starts with grapefruit, which contains a simple bicyclic enone called

nootkatone nootkatone. It was assumed, wrongly as it happens, that the scent of grapefruit came from
supposed flavour this compound, and in the 1970s there was quite a rush to synthesize this compound in variprinciple of grapefruit

ous laboratories. A remarkable feature of many successful syntheses was the use of fragmentation reactions. We shall describe parts of three syntheses involving the fragmentation of a
six-, a four-, and a three-membered ring.
Most syntheses make the side-chain alkene by an elimination reaction so the fi rst ‘disconnec
The terminology

tion’ is an FGI adding HX back into the alkene. The last C–C bond-forming operation in most

(‘disconnection’, ‘FGI’) in this
paragraph derives from syntheses is an intramolecular aldol reaction to make the enone so that can be disconnected

next. It is the starting material for the aldol, a simple monocyclic diketone, which is usually
made by a fragmentation reaction because this is a good way to set up the stereochemistry.

###### Fragmentation of a three-membered ring

This synthesis does not look as though it will lead to nootkatone because the fragmentation
product still requires a great deal of modifi cation. It has the advantage that the stereochemistry is correct at one centre at least. The sequence starts from natural (–)-carone: conjugate
addition of the enolate to butenone without control leads to a bicyclic diketone with one extra
stereogenic centre. The enone adds to the bottom face of the enolate opposite the dimethylcyclopropane ring so the methyl group is forced upwards.

Now the diketone is cyclized by a Robinson-style aldol condensation in HCl to give a

old three-membered ring has disappeared, evidently by fragmentation.

The fragmentation is pulled by the enone (with some help from the acid) and pushed by the

Addition of a proton to the end of the enol and a chloride ion to the cation gives the product.
The further development of this compound into nootkatone is beyond the scope of this book.

###### Fragmentation of a four-membered ring

This approach leads directly to the enone needed for nootkatone. A diketone prepared from a
natural terpene is also treated with HCl and much the same reactions ensue except that the
fragmentation now breaks open a four-membered ring. First, the intramolecular aldol reaction to make the second six-membered ring.

Now the fragmentation, which follows much the same course as the last one: the enone again
provides the electron pull while the cleavage of a strained C–C single bond in a four-membered ring to give a tertiary carbocation provides the electron push. A simple elimination is all
that is needed to make nootkatone from this bicyclic chloroenone.

###### Fragmentation of a six-membered ring


**Cl**


This chemistry is quite different from the examples we have just seen. The starting material
has a bridged bicyclic structure and was made by a Diels–Alder reaction. Fragmentation is
initiated by formic acid (HCO2H), which protonates the tertiary alcohol and creates a tertiary
carbocation. The ether provides the push. More serious electronic interactions are needed in
this fragmentation as the C–C bond being broken is not in a strained ring.

The yield of 50% may not seem wonderful, but there is obviously a lot of chemistry going
on here so it is perfectly acceptable when so much is being achieved. The fi rst stage is the
fragmentation itself. Drawing the product fi rst of all in the same shape as the starting material
and then redrawing, to ensure that we don’t make a mistake, we discover that we are well on
the way to nootkatone. Note that the stereochemistry of the two methyl groups comes directly
from the stereochemistry of the starting materials and no new stereogenic centres are created
in the fragmentation. Although one six-membered ring is fragmented, another remains.

The fi rst-formed product now cyclizes to form the second six-membered ring. This recreates
a carbocation at the tertiary centre like the one that set off the fragmentation as the more
nucleophilic end of the isolated alkene attacks the end of the conjugate electrophile. This is a
thermodynamically controlled reaction with the new stereogenic centre choosing to have an
equatorial substituent.

The cation picks up the only nucleophile available—formic acid. This gives the product of the
fragmentation, which contains two unstable functional groups—a tertiary formate ester and an
enol ether—and this product is not isolated from the reaction mixture. In water it hydrolyses to
the enone, which undergoes elimination of formate to give nootkatone on heating.

Yet after all this effort, none of the synthetic samples of nootkatone delivered that intense
grapefruit smell—for the simple reason that nootkatone is not the fl avour principle of grapefruit! The samples of nootkatone that had been isolated from grapefruit contained minute
traces of the true fl avour principle—a simple thiol. Humans can detect 2 × 10[−][5] ppb (parts per
_billion) of this compound, so even the tiniest trace is very powerful. Nonetheless, the syn-_
theses allowed chemists to correct a misconception.

###### Looking forward

Fragmentation reactions cleave C–C single bonds by a combination of electron push and
electron pull so that both electrons in the bond move in the same direction as the bond
breaks. In the next chapter we shall see reactions that break C–C bonds in a quite different
way. No electron push or pull is required because one electron goes one way and one the
other. These are radical reactions.

###### Radicals contain unpaired electrons

You may remember that at the beginning of Chapter 8 we said that the cleavage of H–Cl into
H[+] and Cl[−] is possible in solution only because the ions that are formed are solvated: in the gas
phase, the reaction is endothermic with ΔG = +1347 kJ mol[−][1], a value so vast that even if the
whole universe were made of gaseous HCl at 273 K, not a single molecule would be dissociated
into H[+] and Cl[−] ions. At temperatures above about 200 °C, however, HCl does begin to dissociate, but not into ions. Instead of the chlorine atom taking both bonding electrons with it,
leaving a naked proton, the electron pair forming the H–Cl bond is shared out between the
two atoms. ΔG for this reaction is a much more reasonable +431 kJ mol[−][1] and, at high temperatures (above about 200 °C, that is), HCl gas can be dissociated into H and Cl atoms.

In Chapter 24 we introduced the fact that bromine radicals react regioselectively with alkenes. Let us remind you of one reaction you met then: radical addition to an alkene. The
product is an alkyl bromide, and is a different alkyl bromide from the one formed when HBr
adds to an alkene in an ionic manner.

What does the peroxide do to change the mechanism of the reaction? Peroxides undergo
homolysis of the weak O–O bond extremely easily to form two radicals. We said that HCl in
the gas phase undergoes homolysis in preference to heterolysis: other types of bond are even
more susceptible to homolysis. You can see this for yourself by looking at this table of bond
dissociation energies (ΔG for X–Y → X[•] + Y[•]).

Dialkyl peroxides (dimethyl peroxide is shown in the table) contain the very weak O–O
bond. The radicals formed by homolytic cleavage of these bonds, stimulated by a little heat or
light, initiate what we call a radical chain reaction, which results in the formation of the Br[•]
radicals, which add to the alkene’s C=C double bond (see Chapter 24).



- Try to get a feel for bond
strengths: we shall refer to them
a lot in this chapter as they’re
very important to radical
reactions. Compare this with the
situation for ionic reactions, in
which the strengths of the
bonds involved are often much
less important than polar effects
(see the example on p. 207).

###### Radicals form by homolysis of weak bonds

This is the most important way of making radicals: unpairing a pair of electrons by homolysis,
making two new radicals. Temperatures of over 200 °C will homolyse most bonds; on the
other hand, some weak bonds will undergo homolysis at temperatures little above room
temp erature. Light is a possible energy source for the homolysis of bonds too. Red light has
associated with it 167 kJ mol[−][1]; blue light has about 293 kJ mol[−][1]. Ultraviolet (200 nm), with an
associated energy of 586 kJ mol[−][1], will decompose many organic compounds (including the
DNA in skin cells: sunbathers beware!).
There are a number of compounds whose homolysis is particularly important to chemists,
and the most important ones are discussed in turn below. They all have weak σ bonds, and
generate radicals that can be put to some chemical use. The halogens are quite readily homolysed by light, as you can see from the bond strengths in the table above, a fact that drives the
radical halogenation reactions that we shall discuss later.
As you saw in Chapter 24, dibenzoyl peroxide is an important compound because it
can act as another initiator of radical reactions. It undergoes homolysis simply on heating.


It is not suffi cient for light to be
energetic enough to promote
homolysis; the molecule must
have a mechanism for absorbing
that energy, and the energy
must end up concentrated in the
vibrational mode that leads to
bond breakage. We shall not

This decomposition mechanism accounts for the separate movements of all the electrons,
but we can also draw the mechanism in a slightly different way: we show two radical (‘fi sh
hook’) arrows forming the molecule of nitrogen but only one arrow to break each of the C–N
bonds. It can be assumed that the electrons ‘left behind’ form radicals as well.

Another way of cutting back on the number of arrows without losing precision in the mechanism is to draw one arrow for each step all in the same (which can be either) direction. The
fi rst mechanism has the advantage of complete clarity; the other two make for neater diagrams. Choose which suits you best.

The important thing is to use the right type of arrow and to make it clear whether you are
moving one, and not two, electrons. A simpler example is the abstraction of a hydrogen atom
by an oxygen-centred radical: any of the mechanisms below is fi ne.

###### Radicals form by abstraction

Notice that we didn’t put HBr on the list of molecules that form radicals by homolysis: relative to the weak bonds we have been talking about, the H–Br bond is quite strong (just
about as strong as a C–C bond). We described in Chapter 24 how oxygen radicals abstract
hydrogen atoms from HBr. You might now like to compare this mechanism with similar
ionic reactions.

molecule, in which all the
electrons are paired, in contrast
with a radical, which has an
unpaired electron.

Hydrogen abstraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom with its one electron. It is not the
removal of a proton: that would be the removal of a hydrogen atom with no electrons, which
happens in ionic reactions.
The ability of radicals to propagate by abstraction is a key feature of radical chain reactions,
which we shall come to later. There is an important difference between homolysis and abstraction as a way of making radicals: homolysis is a reaction of a spin-paired molecule that produces _two radicals; abstraction is a reaction of a radical with a spin-paired molecule that_
produces one new radical and a new spin-paired molecule.


-----

As the comparison above shows, radical abstractions are in fact substitution reactions (at H
in this case). However, radical substitutions differ considerably from SN1 or SN2 reactions:
importantly, radical substitutions almost never occur at carbon atoms. We shall come back to radical substitutions, or abstractions (depending on whether you take the point of view of the H
atom or the Br atom), and explain why this should be, later in the chapter.

###### First radical detected

The very fi rst radical to be detected, the triphenylmethyl radical, was made in 1900 by abstraction of Cl[•] from Ph3CCl by
Ag metal. Many metal atoms such as Ag[•] and Li[•] have single unpaired electrons.
This radical is relatively stable (we shall see why shortly), but reacts with itself reversibly in solution. The product of the
dimerization of triphenylmethyl was for 70 years believed to be hexaphenyl ethane but, in 1970, NMR showed that it
was, in fact, an unsymmetrical dimer.

###### Radicals form by addition

The key step in the radical addition of HBr to an alkyne in Chapter 24 was the formation of a
radical by radical addition. The Br[•] radical (which, you will remember, was formed by abstraction of H[•] from HBr by RO[•]) adds to the alkene to give a new, carbon-centred radical. This is
the radical addition mechanism:

**Br**

radical addition **Br**

Just as charge must be conserved through a chemical reaction, so must the spin of the electrons involved. If a reactant carries an unpaired electron, then so must a product. Addition of
a radical to a spin-paired molecule always generates a new radical. Radical addition is therefore a second type of radical-forming reaction.
The simplest radical addition reactions occur when a single electron is added to a spinpaired molecule. This process is a reduction. You have already met some examples of singleelectron reductions: Birch reductions (Chapter 23) use the single electron formed when a
group I metal (sodium, usually) is dissolved in liquid ammonia to reduce organic compounds.
Group I metals are common sources of single electrons: by giving up their odd s electron they
form a stable M[+] ion. They will donate this electron to several classes of molecules, for example ketones can react with sodium to form ketyl radicals.

###### Radicals form by elimination

A fourth class of radical-forming reaction is elimination. For an example, we can go back to
dibenzoyl peroxide, the unstable compound we considered earlier in the chapter. The radicals
formed from dibenzoyl peroxide by homolysis are themselves unstable and each can break
down by cleavage of a C–C bond, generating CO2 and a phenyl radical. This is a radical elimination reaction, and is the reverse of a radical addition reaction.

###### Most radicals are extremely reactive. . .

Unpaired electrons are desperate to be paired up again. This means that radicals usually have
a very short lifetime; they don’t survive long before undergoing a chemical reaction.
Chemists are more interested in radicals that are reactive because they can be persuaded to
do interesting and useful things. However, before we look at their reactions, we shall consider some radicals that are unreactive so that we can analyse the factors that contribute to
radical reactivity.

###### . . . but a few radicals are very unreactive

Whilst simple alkyl radicals are extremely short-lived, some other radicals survive almost
indefi nitely. Such radicals are known as persistent radicals. We mentioned the triphenylmethyl

Persistent radicals with the single electron carried by an oxygen or a nitrogen atom are also
known: these four radicals can all be handled as stable compounds. The fi rst, known as
TEMPO, is a commercial product and can even be sublimed.

There are two reasons why some radicals are more persistent than others: (1) steric hindrance and (2) electronic stabilization. In the four extreme cases above, their exceptional stability is conferred by a mixture of these two effects. Before we can analyse the stability of
other radicals, however, we need to look at what is known about the shape and electronic
structure of radicals.

###### How to analyse the structure of radicals: electron spin resonance

For the last few pages we have been discussing the species we call radicals without offering any
evidence that they actually exist. Well, there is evidence, and it comes from a spectroscopic
technique known as electron spin resonance, or ESR (also known as EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance). ESR not only confi rms that radicals do exist, but it can also tell us quite a lot
about their structure.
Unpaired electrons, like the nuclei of certain atoms, have a magnetic moment associated
with them. Proton NMR probes the environment of hydrogen atoms by examining the energy
difference between the two possible orientations of their magnetic moments in a magnetic
fi eld; ESR works in a similar way for unpaired electrons. The magnetic moment of an electron
is much bigger than that of a proton, so the difference in energy between the possible quantum


-----

- Notice that, for historical
reasons, ESR spectra are
recorded in a different way from
NMR spectra: the diagram
shows the fi rst derivative of the
absorption spectrum (the sort of
spectrum you would get from a
proton NMR machine).


states in an electron fi eld is also much bigger. This means that the magnets used in ESR spectrometers can be weaker than those in NMR spectrometers, usually about 0.3 tesla; even at this
low fi eld strength, the resonant frequency of an electron is about 9000 MHz (for comparison,
the resonant frequency of a proton at 9.5 tesla is 400 MHz; in other words, a 400 MHz NMR
machine has a magnetic fi eld strength of 9.5 tesla).
But there are strong similarities between the techniques. ESR shows us, for example, that
unpaired electrons couple with protons in the radical. The spectrum below is that of the
methyl radical, Ch3• .The 1:3:3:1 quartet pattern is just what you would expect for coupling

to three equivalent protons; coupling in ESR is measured in millitesla (or gauss; 1 gauss = 0.1
mT), and for the methyl radical the coupling constant (called aH) is 2.3 mT.

absorption spectrum

recorded as the first derivative of the

ESR hyperfi ne splittings (as the coupling patterns are known) can give quite a lot of information about a radical. For example, here is the hyperfi ne splitting pattern of the cycloheptatrienyl radical. The electron evidently sees all seven protons around the ring as
equivalent, and must therefore be fully delocalized. A localized radical would see several different types of proton, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern.

ESR spectrum of cycloheptatrienyl radical

Even the relatively simple spectrum of the methyl radical tells us quite a lot about its structure. For example, the size of the coupling constant aH indicates that the methyl radical is
planar; the trifl uoromethyl radical is, on the other hand, pyramidal. The oxygenated radicals

- H2OH and •CMe2OH lie somewhere in between. The calculations that show this lie outside
the scope of this book.

ESR tells us that the methyl radical is planar: the carbon atom must therefore be sp[2] hybridized,
with the unpaired electron in a p orbital. We can represent this in an energy level diagram.

doubly occupied σ(C–H) orbitals

In Chapter 4 we talked about the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and
LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of organic molecules. CH3 (like all radicals)
has an orbital containing one electron, which we call a **singly occupied molecular**
**orbital (SOMO).**
As with all molecules, it is the energy of the electrons in the molecular orbitals of the radical
that dictate its stability. Any interaction that can decrease the energy levels of the fi lled
molecular orbitals increases the stability of the radical (in other words, decreases its reactivity). Before we use this energy level diagram of the methyl radical to explain the stability of
radicals, we need to look at some experimental data that allow us to judge just how stable different radicals are.


###### Radical stability

On p. 971 we used bond strength as a guide to the likelihood that bonds will be homolysed
by heat or light. Since bond energies give us an idea of the ease with which radicals can
form, they can also give us an idea of the stability of those radicals once they have formed.

greater value means higher energy (more unstable) radicals

This is particularly true if we compare the strengths of bonds between the same atoms,
for example carbon and hydrogen, in different molecules; this table does this.
A few simple trends are apparent. For example, C–H bonds decrease in strength in R–H
when R goes from primary to secondary to tertiary. Tertiary alkyl radicals are therefore the
most stable; methyl radicals the least stable.

C–H bonds next to conjugating groups such as allyl or benzyl are particularly weak, so allyl
and benzyl radicals are more stable. But C–H bonds to alkynyl, alkenyl, or aryl groups are
strong. We saw the effects of this in Chapter 24.

radicals stabilized by functional groups

Whether the functional group is electron withdrawing or electron donating is clearly
irrelevant here: both types seem to stabilize radicals. We can explain all of this if we
look at how the different groups next to the radical centre interact electronically with the
radical.


###### Radicals are stabilized by conjugating, electron-withdrawing, and electron-donating groups

Let’s consider fi rst what happens when a radical centre fi nds itself next to an electron-withdrawing group. Groups like C=O and C≡N are electron withdrawing because they have a
low-lying empty π* orbital. By overlapping with the (usually p) orbital containing the radical
(the SOMO), two new molecular orbitals are generated. One electron (the one in the old
SOMO) is available to fi ll the two new orbitals. It enters the new SOMO, which is of lower
energy than the old one, and the radical experiences stabilization because this electron drops
in energy.

known as captodative

new SOMO is of lower energy

We can analyse what happens with electron-rich groups, such as RO groups, in a similar
way. Ether oxygen atoms have relatively high-energy fi lled n orbitals, their lone pairs.
Interacting this with the SOMO again gives two new molecular orbitals. Three electrons are
available to fi ll them. The SOMO is now higher in energy than it was to start with, but the lone
pair is lower. Because two electrons have dropped in energy and only one has risen, there is
an overall stabilization of the system, even though the new SOMO is of higher energy than
the old one. We shall see later what effect the energy of the SOMO, rather than the overall
energy of the radical, has on its reactivity.

In Chapter 15 you saw how the electrons in C–H σ bonds stabilize cations: they stabilize
radicals in the same way, which is why tertiary radicals are more stable than primary ones.
Conjugation, too, is effective at stabilizing radicals. We know from their ESR spectra (p. 976)
that radicals next to double bonds are delocalized; that they are more stable is evident from
the bond dissociation energies of allylic and benzylic C–H bonds.

###### Steric hindrance makes radicals less reactive

On p. 975 we showed you some radicals that are remarkably stable (persistent): some can even
be isolated and purifi ed. You should now be able to see at least part of the reason for their
exceptional stability: two of them have adjacent powerful electron-donating groups, one has
a powerful electron-withdrawing group as well, and three of the four are conjugated.

But electronic factors alone are not suffi cient to explain the exceptional stability of all four
radicals, since the two radicals on the right receive just about the same electronic stabilization
as the fi rst two above, but are much more reactive.
In fact, the stability of the triphenylmethyl radical we know to be due mainly to steric,
rather than electronic, factors. X-ray crystallography shows that the three phenyl rings in
this compound are not coplanar but are twisted out of a plane by about 30°, like a propeller.
This means that the delocalization in this radical is less than ideal (we know that there is
some delocalization from the ESR spectrum) and, in fact, it is little more delocalized than the
dipheny lmethyl or even the benzyl radical, even though it is much more stable than either.
This must be because the central carbon, which bears most of the radical character, is sterically shielded by the twisted phenyl groups, making it very hard for the molecule to react.



- When it does react, as you
saw in the box on p. 973, it
does so through one of the less
hindered para positions.


-----

The rest of this chapter is devoted to the reactions of radicals, and you will see that the two
effects we have talked about—electronic stabilization and steric hindrance—are key factors
that control these reactions.

###### How do radicals react?

A reactive radical has a choice: it can either fi nd another radical and combine to form a spinpaired molecule (or more than one spin-paired molecule), or it can react with a spin-paired
molecule to form a new radical. Both are possible, and we shall see examples of each. A third
alternative is for a radical to decompose in a unimolecular reaction, giving rise to a new
radical and a spin-paired molecule.

 - **Three possibilities:**

**•** **radical + radical → spin-paired molecule**

**Br** **Br** **Br** **Br**

**•** **radical + spin-paired molecule → new radical + new spin-paired molecule**

**R[1]O** **H** **R[2]** **R[1]OH  +** **R[2]**

**•** **radical → new radical + spin-paired molecule**

**O**

**R** **O** **R** **+ CO2**

###### Radical–radical reactions

In view of the energy released when unpaired electrons pair up, you might expect this type of
radical reaction to be more common than reaction with a spin-paired molecule, in which no
net pairing of electrons takes place. Radical–radical reactions certainly do take place, but they
are not the most important type of reaction involving radicals. We shall see why they are not
as common as you might expect shortly, but fi rst we can look at the few examples of radical–
radical reactions which do work well.

###### The pinacol reaction is a radical dimerization

We outlined on p. 973 a way of making radicals by single electron transfer: effectively, the addition reaction of a single electron to a spin-paired molecule. The types of molecules that undergo
this reaction are those with low-lying antibonding orbitals for the electron to go into, in particular aromatic systems and carbonyl compounds. The radical anion formed by addition of an
electron to a ketone is known as a ketyl. The single electron is in the π* orbital, so we can represent a ketyl with the radical on oxygen or on carbon and the anion on the other atom.

Ketyls behave in a manner that depends on the solvent that they are in. In protic solvents
(ethanol, for example), the ketyl becomes protonated and then accepts a second electron from
the metal (sodium is usually used in these cases). An alkoxide anion results, which, on addi

tion of acid at the end of the reaction, gives an alcohol. Notice that this is a reaction using
sodium metal in ethanol, and not sodium ethoxide, which is the basic product that forms
once sodium has dissolved in ethanol. It is important that the sodium is dissolving as the reaction takes place, since only then are the free electrons available.

In aprotic solvents, such as benzene or ether, no protons are available so the concentration of ketyl radical builds up signifi cantly and the ketyl radical anions start to dimerize.
As well as being a radical–radical process, this dimerization process is an anion–anion
reaction, so why doesn’t electrostatic repulsion between the anions prevent them from
approaching one another? The key to success is to use a metal such as magnesium or aluminium, which forms strong, covalent metal–oxygen bonds and can coordinate to more
than one ketyl at once. Once two ketyls are coordinated to the same metal atom, they
react rapidly.

Pinacol reactions can be carried out intramolecularly, from compounds containing two
carbonyl groups. In fact, the key step of one of the very fi rst syntheses of the important anticancer compound Taxol was an intramolecular pinacol reaction using titanium as the source
of electrons.

The titanium metal that is the source of electrons is produced during the reaction by
reduction of TiCl3 using a zinc–copper mixture. This reaction is, in fact, unusual because, as
we shall see below, pinacol reactions using titanium do not normally stop at the diol, but
give alkenes.

###### Titanium promotes the pinacol coupling and then deoxygenates the products: the McMurry reaction

Titanium can be used as the metal source of electrons in the pinacol reaction and, provided the
reaction is kept cold and not left for too long, diols can be isolated from the reaction, as in the
example above. However, unlike magnesium or aluminium, titanium reacts further with these
diol products to give alkenes in a reaction known as the McMurry reaction, after its inventor.

Notice that the titanium(0), which is the source of electrons in the reaction, is produced
during the reaction by reacting a Ti(III) salt, usually TiCl3, with a reducing agent such as
LiAlH4 or Zn/Cu. The reaction does not work with, say, powdered titanium metal. The
McMurry reaction is believed to be a two-stage process involving fi rstly a pinacol radical–
radical coupling.

We expect you to be mildly horrifi ed by the inadequacy of the mechanism above. But,
unfortunately, we can’t do much better because no-one really knows quite what is happening.
The McMurry reaction is very useful for making tetrasubstituted double bonds—there are few
other really effective ways of doing this. However, the double bonds really need to be symmetrical (in other words, have the same substituents at each end) because McMurry reactions
between two different ketones are rarely successful.

McMurry reactions also work very well intramolecularly, and turn out to be quite a good
way of making cyclic alkenes, especially when the ring involved is medium or large (over
about eight members). For example, the natural product fl exibilene, with a 15-membered
ring, can be made by cyclizing a 15-keto-aldehyde.

###### Esters undergo pinacol-type coupling: the acyloin reaction


flexibilene


You’ve seen examples of pinacol and McMurry reactions of ketones and aldehydes. What
about esters? You would expect the ketyl radical anion to form from an ester in the same way,
and then to undergo radical dimerization, and this is indeed what happens.

The diketone is, however, still reducible—in fact, 1,2-diketones are more reactive towards
electrophiles and reducing agents than ketones because their π* is lower in energy and
straight away two electron transfers take place to form a molecule, which we could term an
**enediolate. On quenching the reaction with acid, this dianion is protonated twice to give**
the enol of an α-hydroxy-ketone, and it is this α-hydroxy-ketone that is the fi nal product
of the acyloin reaction. The yield in this example is a quite respectable 70%. However, in
many other cases, this usefulness of the acyloin reaction is hampered by the formation of
by-products that arise because of the reactivity of the enediolate dianion. It is, of course,
quite nucleophilic, and is likely to be formed in the presence of the highly electrophilic
diketone. It is also basic, and often catalyses a competing Claisen condensation of the
esters being reduced.

- Think of radicals as smashand-grab raiders. They pick the
fi rst shop that catches their eye,
smash the window, and run off
with a handful of cheap
jewellery from the front of the
display. Ions in solution are
stealthy burglars. They scan all
the houses on the street, choose
the most vulnerable, and then
carefully gain entry to the room
that they know contains the
priceless oil painting.


It’s not by accident that these two examples of the acyloin reaction show the formation of cyclic
compounds. It is a particularly powerful method of making carbocyclic rings from four-membered
upwards: the energy to be gained by pairing up the two electrons in the radical–radical reaction
step more than compensates for the strain that may be generated in forming the ring.

###### The pinacol, McMurry, and acyloin reactions are exceptional

We’ve already said that this type of reaction, in which two radicals dimerize, is relatively uncommon. Most radicals are simply too reactive to react with one another! This may sound nonsensical, but the reason is simply that highly reactive species are unselective about what they react
with. Although it might be energetically favourable for them to fi nd another radical and dimerize, they are much more likely to collide with a solvent molecule, or a molecule of some other
compound present in the mixture, than another radical. Reactive radicals are only ever present
in solution in very low concentrations, so the chances of a radical–radical collision are very low.
Radical attack on spin-paired molecules is much more common and, because the product of such
reaction is also a radical, they give rise to the possibility of radical chain reactions.

###### Radical chain reactions

In looking at how radicals form, you’ve already seen examples of how radicals react. In fact,
we’ve already dealt (if only very briefl y) with every step of the sequence of reactions that
makes up the mechanism of the radical reaction you met at the beginning of the chapter, and
shown below.

**ROOR**

Let’s now consider each step in turn and in more detail.

**1.** The dialkyl peroxide is homolysed (by heat or light) to give two alkoxy radicals.

**2.** RO[•] abstracts H from HBr (radical substitution) to give Br[•].

**3.** Br[•] adds to isobutene to give a carbon-centred radical.

**4.** The carbon-centred radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from H–Br to form the
fi nal addition product and regenerate Br[•], which can react with another
molecule of alkene.

**R** **O** **H** **Br** **ROH + Br**

So the whole process is a cycle with the bromine radical regenerated in the last step, the one
in which the product is formed.

In each step in the cycle a radical is consumed and a new radical is formed. This type of
reaction is therefore known as a **radical chain reaction, and the two steps that form the**
cyclic process that keeps the chain running are known as the chain propagation steps. Only
one molecule of peroxide initiator is necessary for a large number of product molecules to be
formed and, indeed, the peroxide needs to be added in only catalytic quantities (about
10 mol%) for this reaction to proceed in good yield.
Any less than 10 mol%, however, and the yield drops. The problem is that the chain reaction is not 100% effi cient. Because the concentration of radicals in the reaction mixture is low,
radical–radical reactions are rare, but nonetheless they happen often enough that more peroxide keeps being needed to start the chain off again.

possible radical–radical chain termination steps

**Br** **Br** **Br**

**Br** **Br** **Br2** **Br**

Reactions like this are known as termination steps and are actually an important part of
any chain reaction; without termination steps the reaction would be uncontrollable.


-----

- We have already suggested
two reasons why the Br[•] radical
adds to the alkene with this
characteristic regioselectivity,
giving a primary alkyl bromide
when the polar addition of HBr
to an alkene would give a
tertiary alkyl bromide: (1) attack
at the unsubstituted end of the
alkene is less sterically hindered
and (2) the tertiary radical thus
formed is more stable than a
primary radical. In fact, of all the
hydrogen halides, only HBr will
add to alkenes in this fashion:
HCl and HI will undergo only
polar addition to give the
tertiary alkyl halide. Why? We
need to be able to answer this
type of question too.


###### Selectivity in radical chain reactions

In the radical–radical reactions we looked at earlier, there was never any question of what
would react with what: only one type of radical was formed and the radicals dimerized in identical pairs. Look at the chain reaction above though—there are three types of radical present,
Br[•], BrCH2Me2CH[•], and RO[•], and they all react specifi cally with a chosen spin-paired partner:
Br[•] with the alkene, and BrCH2Me2CH[•] and RO[•] with HBr. We need to understand the factors
that govern this chemoselectivity. In order to do so we shall look at another radical reaction
with chemoselectivity and regioselectivity that is measurable.

###### Chlorination of alkanes

Alkanes will react with chlorine radicals to give alkyl chlorides. For example, cyclohexane plus
chlorine gas, in the presence of light, gives cyclohexyl chloride and hydrogen chloride.

**Cl**
**Cl2** _hν_
**HCl+**

###### The Toray process

A variant of this reaction, known as the Toray process, is used on an industrial scale to produce caprolactam, a precursor
to nylon. Instead of chlorine, nitrosyl chloride is used to form a nitroso compound that rapidly tautomerizes to an oxime.
As you saw in Chapter 36, this oxime undergoes a Beckmann rearrangement under acid conditions to form caprolactam.

This type of reaction is important industrially since it is one of the few that allows compounds containing functional groups to be made from alkanes. As you might guess, since it
needs light for initiation, the process is another example of a radical chain reaction. As with
the radical addition of HBr to alkenes, we can identify initiation, propagation, and termination steps in the mechanism.

event (photolysis of chlorine). Be warned: reactions like this can be explosive in sunlight
and are carried out in specialized facilities, not in the open laboratory.
When the chlorine radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the cyclohexane, only one
product can be formed because all 12 hydrogen atoms are equivalent. For other alkanes this
may not be the case, and mixtures of alkyl chlorides can result. For example, propane is chlorinated to give a mixture of alkyl chlorides containing 45% 1-chloropropane and 55%
2-chloropropane, and isobutane is chlorinated to give 63% iso-butyl chloride and 37% tertbutyl chloride.

formed and broken. First, the chlorination of propane. A chlorine radical, produced by photolysis, can abstract either a primary hydrogen atom, from the end of the molecule, or a secondary hydrogen atom, from the middle. For the two processes, we have these energy gains
and losses:

one H–Cl bond formed – 431 one H–Cl bond formed – 431

one primary C–H bond broken + 423 one secondary C–H bond broken + 410

total – 8 total – 21

Abstraction of the secondary hydrogen atom is more exothermic than abstraction of the
primary hydrogen atom for the related reasons that: (1) secondary C–H bonds are weaker than
primary ones and (2) secondary radicals are more stable than primary ones. So, we get more
2-chloropropane than 1-chloropropane. But in this case, that isn’t the only factor involved:
remember that there are six primary hydrogen atoms and only two secondary ones, so the relative reactivity of the primary and secondary positions is even more different than the simple
ratio of products from the reaction suggests. This statistical factor is more evident in the second
example we gave above, the chlorination of isobutane. Now the choice is between formation
of a tertiary radical and formation of a primary one.

one primary C–H bond broken + 423 one tertiary C–H bond broken + 397

total − 8 total − 34

Tertiary radical formation is more exothermic, yet more primary alkyl chloride is formed
than tertiary alkyl chloride. However, once the 9:1 ratio of primary to tertiary hydrogen atoms
is taken into account, the relative reactivities, as determined experimentally, turn out to be as
shown in the table below.

- **Bond strength is important in radical reactions**

**These reactions illustrate a key point about radical reactions—an important factor affecting**
**selectivity is the strength of the bonds being formed and broken.**



- Bond strength is only a guide
to selectivity in radical reactions.
As we shall see shortly, it’s not
the only factor involved. Indeed,
you’ve already seen steric effects
in action when the Br[•] radical is
added to the less hindered end
of the alkene in the fi rst radical
reaction of this chapter, and you
will later see how frontier orbital
effects can operate too.



- We use the symbol (•) to
mean a partial radical; a radical
that is partially centred on this
atom. The symbols (–) and (+)
are used to mean a similar thing
when a charge is shared by
more than one atom.



- Of course our calculations
involving bond energies only
gave us values for ΔH, not ΔG,
which is what this diagram
represents. However, we can
assume that the TΔS term in the
relationship ΔG = ΔH – TΔS is
relatively insignifi cant.


The rate of attack by Cl[•] on a tertiary C–H bond, then, is about fi ve times the rate of attack
by Cl[•] on a primary C–H bond. We said that this is because the formation of the tertiary radical is more exothermic than the formation of the primary radical. But the rate of a reaction
depends not on ΔH for that reaction but on the activation energy of the reaction; in other
words, the energy needed to reach the transition state for the reaction. But we can still use the
stability of the product radicals as a guide to the stability of the transition state because the
transition state must have signifi cant radical character.

reaction coordinate

The energy diagram above illustrates this point. As the reactants (Cl[•] plus isobutane) move
towards the products, they pass through a transition state (TS1 for formation of the primary
radical, TS3 for formation of the tertiary) in which the radical character of the Cl[•] starting
material is spread over both the Cl and the C centres. The greater stability of a tertiary radical
compared with a primary one must be refl ected to a lesser degree in these transition states: a
radical shared between Cl and a tertiary centre will be more stable than a radical shared
between Cl and a primary centre. The transition state TS3 for the reaction at the tertiary C–H
bond is therefore of lower energy than the transition state TS1 for reaction at the primary C–H
bond. In other words, the activation energy ΔG3‡ is smaller than ΔG1‡, so reaction at the tertiary C–H bond is faster.

###### Bromination of alkanes is more selective

Bromine will also halogenate alkanes, and it does so much more selectively than chlorine. For
example, the following reaction yields tert-butyl bromide with less than 1% of the primary
isomer.


**Br2** _hν_ **Br**
+

>99% <1%


**Br**


In this case, the fi rst step of the radical chain reaction, the abstraction of H by Br[•], is endothermic for both the primary and tertiary hydrogen atoms, but more so for primary radical
formation, so the tertiary radical is preferred.


-----

Of course, in both brominations and chlorinations the overall reaction is favourable because
the second step—the halogenation of the alkyl radical—is signifi cantly exothermic, by about
106 kJ mol[−][1] for chlorination and about 83 kJ mol[−][1] for bromination. The same is true for
fl uorination, but with fl uorine this step is so exothermic that fl uorination becomes dangerously explosive. Conversely, radical iodination is impossible because the fi nal step is insuffi ciently exothermic to make up for the endothermic formation of an alkyl radical.
Why is bromination so much more selective than the chlorination of alkanes? This is a good
example of the Hammond postulate, applied to real chemistry. Because the products of the fi rst
step of the bromination (R[•] plus HBr) are higher in energy than the starting materials, the transition state must be similar in structure and energy to the radical being formed; the difference in
energies of the primary and tertiary product radicals should therefore be markedly refl ected in
the different energies of the transition states TS1 and TS3, and ΔG1‡ will be signifi cantly larger
than ΔG3‡. For the chlorination reaction, the products were just slightly lower in energy than the
starting materials, so the transition states for the two possible reactions both resembled the
starting materials rather more and the products rather less. These are the same for both tertiary
and primary hydrogen abstractions, of course, so the difference in energy of the product radicals
exerts a less pronounced effect on the difference in energy of the transition states.

###### Allylic bromination

Because radical brominations are so selective, they can be used successfully in the laboratory
to make alkyl bromides. There are relatively few ways of functionalizing an unfunctionalized
centre, and radical allylic bromination is one of the most effective. We introduced this reaction
in Chapter 24, where we contrasted the radical reactivity of Br2 towards alkenes (leading to an
allyl bromide by hydrogen abstraction) with its ionic reactivity (leading to addition of bromine
across the alkene). We can now look in a little more detail at the selectivities involved.

The Hammond postulate
gives information about the
structure of transition states. It
says that two states that interconvert directly (are directly
linked in a reaction profi le diagram) and that are close in
energy are also similar in structure. So a transition state will be
most like the starting material,
an intermediate, or the product
if it is close in energy to one of
these observable structures.


-----

- These fi gures were
determined in the gas phase,
and here our reactions are in
solution. Nonetheless, because
solvation effects are more or
less the same for all radicals, we
expect the order of the bond
strengths to remain the same in
both phases.


Here is a typical allylic bromination. NBS (N-bromosuccinimide) is used to form a small
amount of Br2 and to keep the Br2 concentration low.

Photolysis of Br2 initiates the reaction, which then propagates as shown below. The mechanism also illustrates the fi rst aspect of selectivity: only a (green) allylic H atom is abstracted
because an allylic C–H bond is considerably weaker than a secondary C–H bond (364 vs. 410
kJ mol[−][1] from the table on p. 977).

There is a problem with this reaction if bromine itself is used because an alternative radical

The fi rst step of this competing addition reaction is reversible; the reaction is driven forward
by the participation of a second molecule of bromine that traps the product alkyl radical. This
side reaction can be prevented if the concentration of Br2 in the reaction is kept very low,
which is the role of NBS. The alternative competing polar addition of Br2 to the alkene is likewise prevented with the low bromine concentration provided by NBS, although the non-polar
solvent CCl4 also disfavours the formation of the cationic bromonium ion intermediate.
While radical halogenation of alkanes is used only rarely in the laboratory, radical allylic
bromination of alkenes is a versatile and commonly used way of making allylic bromides.
Nucleophilic substitution reactions can then be used to convert the bromide to other functional groups. For example, some chemists in Manchester needed to make the two diastereoisomers of 5-tert-butyl-cyclohex-2-en-1-ol to study their reactions with osmium tetroxide.
_tert-Butyl cyclohexene is readily available, so they used a radical allylic bromination to intro-_
duce the functional group in the allylic position, which they converted to a hydroxyl group
using aqueous base. Steric effects also play a role here in the regioselectivity of the reaction:
only the less hindered allylic hydrogen atoms further from the t-butyl group are removed.

Clearly, for this reaction to be energetically favourable, the new bonds formed (Sn–Br and
C–H) must be stronger than the old bonds broken (Sn–H and C–halogen). Look at this table
of average bond energies and you will see that this is indeed so. The use of a tin hydride is
crucial to this reaction: Sn–H bonds are weaker than Sn–Br bonds, while, for carbon, C–H
bonds are stronger. Bu3SnH is therefore an effective source of Bu3Sn[•] radicals, and the Bu3Sn[•]
radical will abstract halogens, particularly I or Br, but also Cl, from organic halides, breaking
a weak C–halogen (C–Hal) bond and forming a strong Sn–Hal bond. The complete mechanism of the reaction reveals a chain reaction.

###### Homolysis of Bu3SnH is promoted by the initiator AIBN


+ **SnBu3**


As you would imagine, the weakest C–Hal bonds are the easiest to cleave, so alkyl bromides
are reduced more rapidly than alkyl chlorides, and alkyl fl uorides are unreactive. With alkyl
iodides and bromides, daylight can be suffi cient to initiate the reaction, but with alkyl chlorides, and often with alkyl bromides as well, it is generally necessary to produce a higher
concentration of Bu3Sn[•] radicals by adding an initiator to the reaction. The best choice is usually AIBN, which you met earlier in the chapter (p. 972). This compound undergoes thermal
homolysis above 60 °C to give nitrile-stabilized radicals that abstract the hydrogen atom from
Bu3SnH.

Why use AIBN as an initiator; why not a peroxide? Since we want to cleave only a weak
Sn–H bond, we can get away with using a relatively unreactive nitrile-stabilized radical.
Peroxides, on the other hand, generate RO[•] radicals. These are highly reactive and will abstract
hydrogen from almost any organic molecule, not just the weakly bonded hydrogen atom of
Bu3SnH, and this would lead to side reactions and lack of selectivity. AIBN is needed only in
suffi cient quantities to be an initiator of the reaction; it is the Bu3SnH that provides the hydrogen atoms that end up in the product, so usually you need only 0.02 to 0.05 equivalents of
AIBN and a slight excess (1.2 equivalents) of Bu3SnH.

should be even weaker.

###### Carbon–carbon bond formation with radicals

You have now met these examples of radical chain reactions:

**1.** radical addition of halogens to double bonds

**2.** radical substitution of hydrogen by halogens, or of halogens by hydrogen.

You have seen how the selectivity of these reactions depends upon the bond strengths of
the bond being formed or broken. Until about 1975, these reactions, with a few exceptions,
were all that were expected of radicals. Since that date, however, the use of radicals in synthetic chemistry has increased tremendously, to the point where complex ring structures
such as those of the natural product hirsutene or the steroids can be made from simple acyclic
precursors in one radical-promoted step.
What has made this all possible is that chemists have learned how to understand the selectivity of radical reactions to such a degree that they can design starting materials and reagents
to defi ne precisely the bonds that will break and form during the reactions. We shall now go
on to look at the most important consequence of this ability to control radical reactions: they
can be used to make carbon–carbon bonds.
The radical reaction in the margin forms a new carbon–carbon bond. The mechanism is
quite similar to that of the very fi rst radical reaction we showed you, right at the beginning of
the chapter. Now, with your additional appreciation of the role of bond strength in the selectivity of radical reactions, you should be able to understand why each step proceeds in the way
that it does.
First the weakest bond, C–Br, is broken by the light being shone on to the reaction. Two radicals form, CCl3• and Br•, and it is the CCl3• that adds to the (less hindered) unsubstituted end
of the alkene to produce a (more stable) secondary benzylic radical.

**CCl3**

- It is mainly this step that
produces the [•]CCl3 that
undergoes addition to the
alkene—the initial photolysis, of
course, produces both Br[•] and

- Cl3, either of which could add,
but, once the radical chain has
been initiated, only [•]CCl3 is
reproduced.


This radical abstracts a Br atom from the BrCCl3, breaking the (weakest) C–Br bond, forming the product, and regenerating [•]CCl3, which adds to another molecule of alkene. Notice
that the carbon-centred radical abstracts Br[•] and not [•]CCl3 from BrCCl3—to abstract [•]CCl3
would require a radical substitution at carbon—remember, radicals want the easy pickings
from the front of the display; they don’t go nosing round the back to see if there’s anything
better to be had.

**Br**


This reaction works quite well, giving 78% of the product, but it relies on the fact that the
starting material, BrCCl3, has an unusually weak C–Br bond (the [•]CCl3 radical is highly stabilized by those three chlorine atoms). You can’t use most other alkyl bromides for a number of
reasons, not least of them being that the product is also an alkyl bromide and, without the
selectivity provided by the CCl3 group, the result would be a mixture of polymers. The problem is that we want the product radical to abstract Br from the starting alkyl bromide to make

For a way of overcoming this problem, let’s go back to the reaction we looked at a few pages
ago, the dehalogenation of alkyl halides by Bu3SnH. The mechanism involves formation of an
alkyl (carbon-centred) radical by abstraction of Br by Bu3Sn[•]. This alkyl radical then just
abstracted H[•] from Bu3SnH.

Is it not possible to use this alkyl radical more constructively, and encourage it to react with
another molecule (an alkene, say, as [•]CCl3 did)? The answer is a qualifi ed yes: look at this

Something important has happened here: the product radical no longer has to abstract the
halogen from the starting material, but instead has to abstract H from Bu3SnH; it is the Bu3Sn[•]
thus formed that then regenerates the starting radical. The driving force is provided by formation of C–H at the expense of Sn–H and then Sn–Br at the expense of C–Br.
The use of tin hydrides increases the power of radical reactions in organic synthesis tremendously, and all of the steps in these radical chain processes have been studied in great detail
because of the importance of the reactions. We won’t dwell excessively on these details, but
we need to go back and re-examine some points about this reaction because there are some
further subtleties that you need to understand. Bear in mind that we have four radicals all in
the reaction mixture at the same time. Yet each reacts with its chosen partner, forsaking all
others.
Let’s take each type of radical in turn, and look at its selectivity. Clearly bond strength has
something to do with this, but how do you explain the opposing selectivities of R[•] and the
nitrile-stabilized radicals? We shall see that the origins of the selectivities impose some
restrictions on the type of starting material that can be used for these C–C bond-forming
reactions.

- A useful alternative to NaBH4
as a reducing agent, particularly
when there are reactive carbonyl
groups in the molecule, is
NaCNBH3, which still reduces
Bu3SnHal but will not touch
aldehydes or ketones (see
Chapter 23).


For the tin radical, Bu3Sn[•], there is a choice of reaction partners: we need it to abstract the
halide from the starting material, but it could alternatively add to the alkene. The Sn–C bond
is relatively weak, so addition to the alkene becomes a signifi cant reaction only if:

 - there is a large excess of alkene present, and

 - the starting alkyl halide is relatively unreactive. This means that only alkyl bromides
and iodides can be used effectively to form carbon–carbon bonds; alkyl chlorides are
just too unreactive.

The contrasting reactivity of the **alkyl radical R[•] and the** **nitrile-containing radicals**
needs a little more analysis, and we will look at how both concentration and electronics affect
their selectivities.

###### Concentration effects

You know that R[•] is perfectly capable of abstracting H from Bu3SnH because that is what happened in the dehalogenation reaction on p. 991, but here a different reaction happens: addition to the alkene. In fact, the rate constant for reaction of R[•] with Bu3SnH is about the same as
that for reaction with acrylonitrile (CH2=CHCN), so the only way in which good yields can
be obtained is by ensuring that the concentration of acrylonitrile is always at least 10 times
that of the tin hydride. The difference in rates will then be suffi cient to give 10 times as much
addition to the alkene as reduction by the tin hydride. Too much acrylonitrile in the reaction
mixture causes problems with side reactions, so a good way of achieving this is to add the tin
hydride very slowly during the reaction—often a device known as a syringe pump is used for
this. Of course, for complete reaction, a whole equivalent of hydride is necessary, but this can
be added over a period of hours.
An elegant alternative is to use a technique conceptually similar to the use of NBS to provide
a low concentration of Br2 for radical allylic substitution. Instead of adding one equivalent of
Bu3SnH, a catalytic amount (usually 0.1–0.2 equivalents) of Bu3SnCl is added at the beginning
of the reaction, with 1 equivalent of NaBH4. NaBH4 will reduce Bu3SnHal to Bu3SnH, so about
0.1 equivalent of Bu3SnH is formed immediately. With each cycle of the chain reaction, a
molecule of this Bu3SnH is converted to Bu3SnBr, which NaBH4 can reduce back to Bu3SnH.
Only as much Bu3SnH is produced as is needed because the rate of production is limited by the
rate of reaction.


This method was used in the following example, in which an enantiomerically pure lactone, a useful synthetic building block, was made from naturally occurring glyceraldehyde.

The second key to success in making sure that the alkyl radical behaves well is to use a reactive radical trap. In fact, this is a major limitation of intermolecular radical carbon–carbon
bond-forming reactions: for the trapping of alkyl radicals only electrophilic alkenes
(attached to electron-withdrawing groups such as –CN, –CO2Me, and –COMe) will do. This
is a limitation, but nonetheless cyclohexyl iodide adds to all these alkenes with the yields
shown and the rate of addition to most of these alkenes is 10[3] to 10[4] times that of addition
to 1-hexene.

To explain why, we have to go back to our analysis (on p. 978) of the electronic structure of
radicals and the energy of SOMOs. We said there that, while both electron-withdrawing
groups and electron-donating groups will stabilize radicals, electron-withdrawing groups
tend to lower the energy of the SOMO, while electron-donating groups tend to raise the
energy of the SOMO.



- **Electrophilic and nucleophilic radicals**

**•** **Low-energy SOMOs are more willing to accept an electron than to give one up; radicals**
**adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups are therefore electrophilic.**

**•** **High-energy SOMOs are more willing to give up an electron than to accept an electron;**
**radicals adjacent to electron-donating groups are therefore nucleophilic.**


Hence the preferred reactivity of these alkyl radicals: they are relatively nucleophilic and
therefore prefer to react with electrophilic alkenes. Reaction between a nucleophilic alkyl
radical and an unfunctionalized (and therefore nucleophilic) alkene is much slower. Similarly,
radicals adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups do not react well with electrophilic alkenes.
We can represent all this on an energy level diagram.

We can now consider the third type of radical in the reaction mixture highlighted on
p. 993—the nitrile-stabilized alkyl radicals. The diagram above explains the third aspect of
radical chemoselectivity in the reaction: why both the product radical and the radicals
produced by AIBN choose to react with Bu3SnH and not with acrylonitrile. These radicals
are electrophilic—they have an electron-withdrawing nitrile group attached to the radical
centre, so reaction with an electron-poor alkene is slow.

C–Br bonds can be used.
However, this is a very weak
C–Cl bond because the radical
produced is so stable. This
electrophilic radical can also be
formed by H abstraction and by
oxidation.


###### Electrophilic radicals

Having seen the energy diagram above, you will not be surprised to learn that the malonate
radical adds readily not to electrophilic alkenes, but to nucleophilic alkenes, such as this vinyl
ether, which carries an electron-donating oxygen substituent. The malonate radical is electron defi cient; it has a low-energy SOMO which interacts best with the relatively high-energy
HOMO of the electron-rich, nucleophilic alkene.

This difference in reactivity applies to non-carbon-centred radicals too. For example, the
methyl radical [•]CH3 and the chlorine radical Cl[•] will both abstract a hydrogen atom from
propionic acid. As you would expect, the methyl radical abstracts the hydrogen atom from
next to the carbonyl group to form a carbonyl-stabilized radical. Perhaps surprisingly (in view
of what we said earlier about the selectivity of radical chlorinations), the chlorine radical
abstracts a hydrogen atom from the terminal methyl group of the acid, despite the fact that
this C–H bond is stronger. The reason has to be to do with HOMO–LUMO interactions. The
methyl radical is nucleophilic, with a high-energy SOMO. It therefore attacks the C–H bond
with the lowest LUMO, in other words, α to the carbonyl group. The chlorine atom, on the
other hand, is electrophilic: it has a low-energy SOMO (because it is an electronegative element) and attacks the C–H bonds of the terminal methyl group because they have the highest-energy HOMO. Chlorination of functionalized compounds is not as straightforward as
that of simple alkanes!

###### Copolymerization

Radical chain reactions are particularly suited to the synthesis of polymers, and there is one example of a polymerization
that is worth including here since it demonstrates very nicely the effect of electron-withdrawing or -donating substituents
on radical reactivity. When a mixture of vinyl acetate and methyl acrylate is treated with a radical initiator, a rather
remarkable polymerization takes place. The polymer produced contains alternating vinyl acetate and methyl acrylate
monomers along the length of its chain.

**O** **OMe** **O** **OMe**

**OAc** + **OMe** radical initiator **OAc** **OAc**

**O** _n_

vinyl acetate methyl acrylate alternating copolymer

The mechanism of the reaction shows you why. The nucleophilic radical from vinyl acetate (adjacent to fi lled n orbital of
OAc; high-energy SOMO) prefers to add to the electrophilic alkene (the acrylate). The new radical (adjacent to the empty
π* orbital of CO2Me; low-energy SOMO) is electrophilic and prefers to add to nucleophilic alkene (the vinyl acetate). This
produces a new nucleophilic radical, which again prefers to add to the electrophilic alkene, and the whole cycle occurs
repeatedly.

**O** **OMe** **O** **OMe** **O** **OMe** **O** **OMe**

**OAc** **OAc** **OAc** **OAc** **OAc**

**R** **R** **R**

The radical produced by addition to vinyl acetate is nucleophilic, so it adds to methyl acrylate; the radical produced by
addition to methyl acrylate is electrophilic, so it adds to vinyl acetate. This reaction is a clear demonstration of the power
of frontier orbital theory to explain the reactivity of organic molecules—it would be hard to come up with any other
convincing explanation.

###### The reactivity pattern of radicals is quite different from that of polar reagents

The fi rst reaction that you met in this book, in Chapter 6, was nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group. Yet we have shown you no examples of radicals adding to carbonyl groups. This
typical reaction of polar reagents is really quite rare with radicals.
In Chapter 8 we introduced the concept of pKa in which we saw acids and bases exchanging protons. Among the strongest organic acids are those containing O–H bonds. Yet you
have seen no radical reactions in which an O–H bond is broken. Carbon acids tend to be
much weaker—yet you’ve seen plenty of examples of C–H bonds being broken by radical
attack.
In Chapter 15 we introduced nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon, using as an
example some alkyl bromides. Now, radicals do react with alkyl halides—but not at carbon!
Instead they abstract the halogen, leaving an alkyl radical.

There is a striking illustration
of the mismatch between the
reactivity of bonds in a simple
molecule and the strength of those
bonds on p. 207.


We used the terms hard and soft in Chapters 15 and 22. From all these reactions it’s evident
that radicals are very soft species: their reactions are driven not at all by the charge density on
an atom but by the strength of the bonds being attacked and by the coeffi cients and energies
of the frontier orbitals. O–H bonds are easily broken by strong bases and C=O bonds attacked
by strong nucleophiles because of the polarization in the O–H and C=O bond. O–H and C=O
bonds are strong, and radicals care nothing for polarization, so radicals prefer to attack the
much weaker C–H bonds which (because they are unpolarized) are often inert towards ionic
reagents.

###### Alkyl radicals from boranes and oxygen

Although the tin hydride + alkyl halide method is very effi cient, tin compounds are falling
out of favour because of their toxicity. The reaction between boranes and oxygen provides a
simple alternative, and many of the reactions carried out formerly using the tin hydride
radical chemistry of pp. 993–997 can now be done using the method we are about to describe.
Mixing trialkylboranes with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds in the presence of water
gives conjugate addition of one of the alkyl groups from the boron. The carbonyl compound
can be an aldehyde (R[2] = H) or a ketone (R[2] = alkyl).

However, H. C. Brown discovered that the reaction was completely inhibited by just 5% of
the stable radical galvinoxyl (shown on p. 975), known to be an effi cient scavenger for radicals. But where were the radicals coming from? Further experiments showed that small
amounts of oxygen were needed to make the reaction work. As you saw in Chapter 3, oxygen
is a triplet diradical and displaces alkyl radicals from the trialkyl borane. This reaction looks
at fi rst like an SN2 and is called an SH2 (second order homolytic displacement), but in reality
the oxygen adds to the empty p orbital of planar trigonal boron to release an alkyl radical and
start the chain reaction.

The chain is completed by displacement of another alkyl radical from a trialkylborane at
oxygen by the delocalized radical and the formation of the same boron enolate proposed in
the ionic reaction. This alkyl radical adds in its turn to the enone, and the boron enolate
which forms is hydrolysed to the ketone product. Only small amounts of oxygen are needed
to initiate the chain and it is not surprising that the air around the reaction mixture is enough
to start a typical reaction. The water (which is inert to radicals, so can be present in the reaction mixture) again hydrolyses the boron enolate.

###### Intramolecular radical reactions are more effi cient than intermolecular ones

All of the reactions you have met so far involve radical attack of one molecule on another.
We’ve pointed out some of the drawbacks when C–C bonds are made in this way: the radical
trap has to be activated (that is, electrophilic to capture nucleophilic radicals) and must often
be present in excess, and the radical starting material must contain very weak C–X bonds
(such as C–Br, C–I). The requirements are much less stringent, however, if the radical reaction
is intramolecular. For example, this reaction works:


**Me3SiO**


**Bu3SnH**

**AIBN**

Notice that the double bond is not activated: in fact, it is nucleophilic, and the reaction still
works even though the radical is also substituted with an electron-donating group. The C–S
bond that is broken is also relatively strong, yet nonetheless a high yield of product is obtained.
Why should this be so? What difference does it make that the reactions are intramolecular?

**Me**


**H** **SnBu3**


The key is that the intramolecular cyclization of the radical is now enormously favoured
over other possible courses of action for the radical. Remember that when we were carrying
out radical reactions intermolecularly, addition to the radical trap was encouraged by increasing the concentration of radical trap and decreasing the concentration of Bu3SnH to avoid
radical reduction. For intramolecular reactions, the double bond that acts as the radical trap is
always held close to the radical, and cyclization takes place extremely rapidly, even on to
unactivated double bonds. The hydride donor (Bu3SnH) doesn’t get a look in, and can be present in higher concentrations than would otherwise be possible. Moreover, as there is only
one equivalent of radical trap, and the trap need not be highly reactive, there is little danger
of high concentrations of Bu3Sn[•] reacting with it, so the concentration of Bu3Sn[•] can build up
to levels where the rate of abstraction of groups like Cl, SPh, and SePh is acceptable, despite
their stronger C–X bonds.

 - **Why are intramolecular radical reactions so good?**

radical and radical trap are radical trap always held trapping is
part of the same molecule close to forming radical very fast

radical trap cannot be trap does not need to be radical is not reduced
present in excess highly reactive by Bu3SnH

no danger of addition concentration of Bu3Sn larger concentrations of
of Bu3Sn to trap can be higher Bu3SnH can be present

weaker C–X bonds can be
used as radical sources

For all these reasons, intramolecular radical reactions are very powerful, and are often used
to make fi ve-membered rings.

It is possible to make other ring sizes also, but the range is rather limited. Because of ring
strain, three- and four-membered rings cannot be formed by radical reactions. Otherwise,
smaller rings form faster than larger ones: look at these selectivities.

The preference for formation of a smaller ring is a very powerful one: in this reaction, the
fi ve-membered ring forms and not the six-membered one, even though cyclization to give a
six-membered ring would also give a more stabilized radical.

formation of different ring sizes,

We said earlier that the toxicity of tin poses some problems, so it is useful that the borane–
oxygen method (p. 998) works well for initiating radical cyclizations too. It is not necessary to
incorporate boron into the starting material, since a combination of Et3B, O2, and hypophosphorous acid, H3PO2, can generate a radical from a halide which will cyclize in the same way
as the tin-promoted examples you have just seen. Once again, a fi ve-membered ring is preferred to the alternative six-membered ring.

Notice that the ethyl groups from Et3B are not incorporated into the product. The displacement of Et[•] from Et3B initiates the chain reaction by abstracting the iodine atom from the
starting material. The radical cyclizes to give a fi ve-membered ring, as expected. A cis ring
junction is inevitable because of the acetal ‘tether’.

###### Looking forward

Radicals are important because they react in ways diffi cult to achieve with anions and cations,
and show usefully different selectivity. Although radical reactions are generally less important than ionic reactions, environmental and biological radical reactions are remarkably common in an atmosphere that is 20% oxygen diradical. Diradicals will feature to a greater extent
in the next chapter, in which we move on from carbon atoms carrying seven valence electrons to carbon atoms carrying only six valence electrons, called carbenes.

You remember, of course, that esters can be made from carboxylic acids and alcohols under
acid catalysis, so you might expect them to use this type of method. On a small scale, it’s usually better to convert the acid to an acyl chloride before coupling with an alcohol, using pyridine (or DMAP) as a base; this type of reaction might have been a reasonable choice too.

Diazomethane methylation is a good way of making methyl esters from carboxylic acids on
a small scale because yields are excellent and the only by-product is nitrogen. However, there
is a drawback: diazomethane has a boiling point of –24 °C, and it is a toxic and highly explosive gas. It therefore has to be used in solution, usually in ether; the solution must be dilute,
because concentrated solutions of diazomethane are also explosive. It is usually produced by
reaction of _N-methyl-N-nitrosourea or_ _N-methyl-N-nitrosotoluenesulfonamide with base,_
and distilled out of that reaction mixture as an azeotrope with ether, straight into a solution
of the carboxylic acid.

The mechanism of the reaction that forms diazomethane is shown below. The key step is

Diazomethane will also methylate phenols because they too are acidic enough to protonate
it. Ordinary alcohols, though, are not methylated because they are not strong enough acids to
protonate diazomethane.

The mechanism is now totally different because the light energy promotes loss of nitrogen
(N2) from the molecule without protonation. This means that what is left behind is a carbon
atom carrying just two hydrogen atoms (CH2), and having only six electrons. Species like this
are called carbenes, and they are the subject of this chapter.



- Carbenium ions such as [+]CH3
also have only six valence
electrons, but, of course, unlike
carbenes they are charged.



- Although this reaction
illustrates an important point,
the yield is too low, there are
too many by-products, and the
potential for serious explosions
is too great for it ever to be
useful as a way of making
methyl ethers.

- **Carbenes are neutral species containing a carbon atom with only six valence electrons.**


The six electrons of a carbene are located two in each bond, plus two non-bonding electrons
often represented as :CR2 (as though they were a lone pair). As you will see later, this can be
misleading, but :CR2 is a widely used symbol for a carbene. In the case of :CH2 generated from
diazomethane, the carbene is trapped by the alcohol to make an ether.
Like the radicals in Chapter 37, carbenes are extremely reactive species. More important
than their reaction with alcohols to make ethers are their reactions with alkenes to make
cyclopropanes and their insertion into C–H bonds.

electrophilicity. A carbon atom with only six electrons will do almost anything to get
another two!

###### How do we know that carbenes exist?

The best evidence for the existence of carbenes comes from a group of structures which contain a carbene but are stable compounds. The most important of these are known as the
‘N-heterocyclic carbenes’—the carbene is incorporated into a fi ve-membered ring and stabilized by the presence of two adjacent electron-donating nitrogen atoms and the bulky
_N-substituents. The example below was fi rst made in 1991: it is crystalline, and its X-ray crys-_
tal shows the bond angle at the carbene carbon to be 102°, and [13]C NMR confi rms that the
carbene C atom is electron defi cient. We will come back to the signifi cance of this later.
These stable carbenes are very much the exception: most carbenes are too reactive to be
isolated. Reactive carbenes can, however, be observed by irradiating precursors (often diazo
compounds like diazomethane, which we have just been discussing) trapped in frozen argon
at very low temperatures (less than 77 K). IR and ESR spectroscopy (see p. 975) can then be
used to determine their structure.

###### Ways to make carbenes

Carbenes are usually formed from precursors by the loss of small, stable molecules. We will
discuss some of the most important methods in turn, but you have already seen one in action:
the loss of nitrogen from a diazo compound.

###### Carbenes from diazo compounds

We showed you the formation of a carbene from diazomethane to illustrate how this reaction
was different from the (ionic) methylation of carboxylic acids. But this is not a very practical
way of generating carbenes, not least because of the explosive nature of diazoalkanes.
However, diazocarbonyl compounds are a different matter.

- You may be somewhat
surprised that the structure of
carbenes can be investigated by
ESR—after all, we explained in
Chapter 37 that ESR observes
unpaired electrons, and you
might expect the six valence
electrons of a carbene all to be
paired. Indeed, in some carbenes
they are, but in many they are
not. This is an important point,
and we will discuss it further
later in the chapter.

The reaction of diazomethane with acyl chlorides starts as a simple acylation to give a diazonium compound. If there is an excess of diazomethane, a second molecule acts as a base to
remove a rather acidic proton between the carbonyl and the diazonium groups to give the
diazocarbonyl compound.

What happens to that second molecule of diazomethane? By collecting a proton it turns
into the very reactive diazonium salt, which collects a chloride ion, and MeCl is given off as a
gas. The second method uses tosyl azide, which is just N2 attached to a good leaving group.

While these rhodium and copper carbenoids are unstable, some transition metals such as tungsten and chromium form
stable, isolable carbenoids, called metallocarbenes or Fischer carbenes.

###### Carbenes from tosylhydrazones

Many more carbenes can be made safely from diazoalkanes if the diazoalkane is just an intermediate in the reaction and not the starting material. Good starting materials for these reactions are tosylhydrazones, which produce transient diazo compounds by base-catalysed
elimination of toluenesulfi nate. The diazo compound is not normally isolated, and decomposes to the carbene on heating.



- RhLn means rhodium with an
unspecifi ed number of
unspecifi ed ligands. This
notation is common in
organometallic chemistry when
the nature of the carbon–metal
bonding is important, but the
precise structure of the metal
complex is not.



- This reaction is sometimes
called the Bamford–Stevens
**reaction. Notice that the**
leaving group from nitrogen is
not the familiar tosylate
(toluene-p-sulfonate TsO[−] or

toluene-p-sulfinate (Ts[−] or

β elimination


Carbenes are formed in a number of other similar reactions—for example, loss of carbon
monoxide from ketenes or elimination of nitrogen from azirines—but these are rarely used as
a way of deliberately making carbenes.

###### Carbene formation by α elimination

In Chapter 17 we discussed β elimination in detail—reactions in which a hydrogen atom is
removed from the carbon atom β to the leaving group. α Eliminations (eliminations in which
both the proton and the leaving group are located on the same atom) are also possible—
in fact, the reaction we’ve just been talking about (elimination of toluenesulfi nate from
tosyl hydrazones) is an α elimination. α Eliminations follow a mechanism akin to an E1cB β
elimination—a strong base removes an acidic proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing
group to give a carbanion. Loss of a leaving group from the carbanion creates a carbene.

One of the best known α elimination reactions occurs when chloroform is treated with
base. This is the most important way of making dichlorocarbene, :CCl2, and other dihalocarbenes too, although it must be said that the widespread use of dichlorocarbene in chemistry is due mainly to the ease with which it can be made using this method!
Hydroxide and alkoxide anions are strong enough bases to promote α elimination from
chloroform, and from other trihalomethanes. Carbenes can be formed from dihaloalkanes by
deprotonation with stronger bases such as LDA, and even from primary alkyl chlorides using
the extremely powerful bases phenylsodium or _t-BuLi/t-BuOK (weaker bases just cause_ β
elimination).

- It is unfortunate that the
term carbenoid is used for two
distinct classes of molecule—
usually it refers to the transitionmetal bound carbene formed by
metal-catalysed decomposition
of diazo compounds (see
p. 1018)—and for this reason
the carbenoids that we are
discussing here are best referred
to as ‘lithium carbenoids’, with
the metal specifi ed.


The mixture t-BuLi/t-BuOK is known as Schlosser’s base, and is one of the most powerful bases known. It will abstract
protons from allylic or benzylic positions, and will even deprotonate benzene. Similar, very powerful, bases can be made
from other combinations of alkyllithiums and group I metal alkoxides.


When geminal dibromoalkanes are treated with BuLi, a halogen–metal exchange reaction
produces a lithium carbenoid, with a metal atom and a halogen attached to the same carbon
atom. Lithium carbenoids are stable at very low temperatures—they can be observed by NMR,
but they decompose to carbenes at about –100 °C.

The essence of this type of carbenoid is that it should have a leaving group, such as a halogen, that can accept a pair of electrons and another, usually a metal, that can donate a pair of
electrons. If the metal leaves fi rst, a carbanion is created that can lose the halogen to make a
carbene. They might also leave together. Both mechanisms are α eliminations.

While lithium carbenoids have limited applicability, an analogous zinc carbenoid, which
can be formed by insertion of zinc into diiodomethane, is a reagent in one of the most widely
used carbenoid reactions in chemistry—the Simmons–Smith reaction.

The problem with many of these reactions is that they require strong bases—either the
organometallic compound itself is basic or a base must be used to create the carbanion.
Carbenes are so unstable that they must be formed in the presence of the compound they are
intended to react with, and this can be a problem if that compound is base-sensitive. For
dichlorocarbene, a way round the problem is to make the carbanion by losing CO2 instead of
a metal or a proton. Decarboxylation of sodium trichloroacetate is ideal as it happens at about
80 °C in solution.

###### Carbene formation by deprotonation of a cation

Our fi nal method is in some ways the most straightforward in terms of mechanism: simple
removal of a proton from a stable cation. This is the method used to make very stable carbenes, and it works because both the cation used as the starting material and the carbene
product are stabilized by one or more adjacent lone pairs. Here is an example. Imidazoles are
nucleophilic, and can be alkylated to give relatively stable imidazolium cations, which we can
represent with the charge delocalized between the two nitrogen atoms, although there is
another possible representation with the charge on carbon.

But we can use a curly arrow to move the negative charge towards the positively charged
nitrogen, leaving a neutral species with a lone pair at carbon. A close look at the central
carbon shows, however, that it has only two substituents—it is a carbene. Carbenes with adjacent lone pairs can often be thought of in this way, the lone pair partially delocalized onto the
C atom to help stabilize the electron-defi cient carbene.

###### Carbenes can be divided into two types

We made two important observations in the box on p. 1016 regarding the structure of carbenes that we will now return to and seek an explanation for. Firstly, we said that the X-ray
crystal structure of the stable, crystalline carbene on the left shows that the bond angle at
the carbene C is 102° and, secondly, we said that many carbenes can be observed by ESR—in
other words, they have unpaired electrons.
Spectroscopic investigations of a number of carbenes of differing structures have shown
that they fall broadly into two groups: (1) those (which you will learn to call ‘triplets’) that
ESR spectroscopy demonstrates have unpaired electrons and whose bond angles are
130–150° and (2) those (like the stable crystalline carbene above, and which you will learn
to call ‘singlets’) that have bond angles of 100–110° but cannot be observed by ESR.
Many carbenes, like CH2 itself, can be found in either group, although one may be more
common.

Type 1: triplet carbenes Type 2: singlet carbenes

**N** **N**

**C**

All these observations can be accounted for by considering the electronic structure of a
carbene. Carbenes have two-coordinate carbon atoms: you might therefore expect them
to have a linear (diagonal) structure—like that of an alkyne—with an sp hybridized
carbon atom.


-----

Such a linear carbene would have six electrons to distribute amongst two σ orbitals and two
(higher-energy) p orbitals. The two electrons in the degenerate p orbitals would remain
unpaired because of electron repulsion in the same way as in molecular oxygen •O–O•.

Yet few carbenes are linear: most are bent, with bond angles between 100° and 150°, suggesting a trigonal (sp[2]) hybridization state. An sp[2] hybridized carbene would have three (lowerenergy) sp[2] orbitals and one (high-energy) p orbital in which to distribute its six electrons.
There are two ways of doing this. Either all of the electrons can be paired, with each pair
occupying one of the sp[2] orbitals, or two of the electrons can remain unpaired, with one electron in each of the p orbitals and one of the sp[2] orbitals.

These two possibilities explain our two observed classes of carbene, and the two possible
arrangements of electrons (spin states) are termed triplet and singlet. The orbitals are the same
in both cases but in triplet carbenes we have one electron in each of two molecular orbitals
and in singlet carbenes both electrons go into the sp[2] orbital.

- When a carbene is actually
formed in a chemical reaction, it
may not be formed in its most
stable state, as we shall see.


The existence of the two spin states explains the different behaviour of triplet and singlet
carbenes towards ESR spectroscopy; the orbital occupancy also explains the smaller bond
angle in singlet carbenes, which have an electron-repelling lone pair in an sp[2] orbital.

In the table on p. 1010 we saw that the substituents on the carbene affect which of the two
classes (which we now call singlet and triplet) it falls into. Why? All carbenes have the potential
to exist in either the singlet or the triplet state, so what we mean when we say that a carbene such
as :CH2 is a ‘triplet carbene’ is that the triplet state for this carbene is lower in energy than the
singlet state. The opposite is true for :CCl2. Most type of carbenes are more stable as triplets
because the energy to be gained by bringing the electron in the p orbital down into the sp[2] orbital
is insuffi cient to overcome the repulsion that exists between two electrons in a single orbital.
For most triplet carbenes the singlet spin state that would arise by pairing up the two electrons lies only about 40 kJ mol[−][1] above the ground (triplet) state: in other words, 40 kJ mol[−][1] is
required to pair up the two electrons.
Carbenes that have singlet ground states (such as :CCl2) all have electron-rich substituents
carrying lone pairs adjacent to the carbene centre. These lone pairs can interact with the p
orbital of the carbene to produce a new, lower-energy orbital which the two electrons occupy.
This stabilization of the lone pair provides the incentive that the electron in the p orbital
needs to pair up in the sp[2] orbital.

This interaction corresponds to the point we made above about adjacent lone pairs stabilizing
carbenes via the delocalization shown in the margin, As these arrows suggest, carbenes that
have heavily electron-donating substituents are less electrophilic than other carbenes: indeed,
diamino carbenes can be quite nucleophilic. The division of carbenes into two types explains

their structure. It also helps to explain some of their reactions, especially those that have a
stereochemical implication. We will spend the rest of this chapter discussing how carbenes react.

###### The structure of carbenes depends on how they are made

So far we have considered only the most stable possible structure, singlet or triplet, of a given
carbene. In reality, a carbene will be formed in a chemical reaction and may well be formed as
the less stable of the alternatives. If a reaction occurs by an ionic mechanism on a molecule
with all electrons paired (as most molecules are!) then it must be formed as a singlet. Follow
the α elimination mechanism, for example.

The starting material, a molecule of chloroform CHCl3, has all paired electrons. The C–H σ
bond breaks and the two paired electrons from it form the lone pair of the carbanion. The
carbanion also has all paired electrons. The two paired electrons of one of the C–Cl bonds
leaves the carbanion and the carbene is formed. It has two paired electrons in each of the two
remaining C–Cl bonds and the lone pair, also paired. It is formed as a singlet. As it happens,
the singlet version of CCl2 is also the more stable. But if the carbene were instead CH2 and if
it reacted rapidly, it might not have a chance to change into the more stable triplet state. Since
carbenes are very reactive, this question can be important. In explaining their reactions in
the next section we shall need to consider:

 - how the carbene was formed

 - how rapidly it reacts

 - whether it can change into the other state (singlet or triplet).

###### How do carbenes react?

Carbenes are desperate to fi nd another pair of electrons with which to complete their valence
shell of electrons. In this respect they are like carbocations. Like carbocations, they are
electro philic but, unlike carbocations, they are uncharged. This has consequences for the
type of nucleophiles carbenes choose to react with. Carbocations attack nucleophiles with
high charge density—those carrying a negative or partial negative charge (think of the type
of nucleophiles that will take part in SN1 or Friedel–Crafts reactions). Carbenes, on the other
hand, attack compounds we’d normally never consider as nucleophiles—even simple
alkanes—by taking electrons from their HOMO. Of course, a carbocation will usually react
with the HOMO of a molecule, but it will be much more selective about which HOMOs will
do—usually these have to be lone pairs or electron-rich alkenes. For carbenes, any HOMO will
do—a lone pair, a C=C double bond (electron-rich or -poor), or even a C–H bond.
As you will see (and as we generalized at the beginning of the chapter), many of these reactions can be considered as insertion reactions—overall the carbene appears to have found a
bond and inserted itself in the middle of it. It’s important to remember that the term ‘insertion’ describes the overall consequence of the reaction, but isn’t always an accurate description of the reaction’s mechanism.

###### Carbenes react with alkenes to give cyclopropanes

This reaction is the most important way of making cyclopropanes, and is probably the most
important reaction of carbenes. The mechanism of this type of reaction (an example is
shown in the margin) depends on whether the carbene is a singlet or a triplet, and the outcome of the reaction can provide our fi rst chemical test of the conclusions we came to in the



- In this respect, a carbene is
like an electrophilic radical—
very reactive and very soft.

previous section. Singlet carbenes, like this one here (remember that substituents with lone
pairs stabilize the singlet spin state) can add to alkenes in an entirely concerted manner: the
curly arrows for the process can be written as shown in the margin.
Because the process is concerted, we expect that the geometry of the alkene should be preserved in the product—the reaction ought to be stereospecifi c. The two examples below show
that this is indeed the case. It is more impressive that the Z alkene gives the cis-cyclopropane
as this is less stable than the trans-cyclopropane and would change to E if it could.

The alkene insertion reaction is stereospecifi c only for singlet carbenes. For triplet carbenes,
the reaction is non-stereospecifi c. In the example below, a triplet carbene gives a mixture of
cyclopropane diastereosiomers from a pure Z alkene.

thermally from diazoalkenes
must initially be singlets,
photochemical irradiation allows
them to convert to the more

The mechanism of the reaction must be different with a triplet carbene. In fact, a concerted
reaction is impossible for triplet carbenes because of the spins of the electrons involved. The
spins of a triplet carbene aren’t paired, so once the carbene has added to the alkene in a radical
reaction, the diradical (triplet) intermediate must wait until one of the spins inverts (‘fl ips’)
before the second C–C bond can be formed with paired electrons.

Spin-fl ipping, which can occur only through collision with another molecule (of solvent

The same constraints arising from the need for conservation of electron spin apply to the
_formation as well as to the reaction of carbenes. When a carbene forms by α elimination, say,_
from a molecule with all electrons paired, it must be formed as the singlet, whether or not the
triplet state is lower in energy. Only later may the carbene undergo spin-fl ipping to the triplet
state. Since most carbene reactions are very rapid, this means that carbenes that are known to
have triplet ground states may, in fact, react in their fi rst-formed singlet state because they
don’t have time to spin-fl ip to the triplet. This is true for :CH2 produced from CH2N2, which
adds stereospecifi cally to double bonds because it is formed as a singlet and because the singlet
state is more reactive than the triplet.

###### Some evidence for triplet carbenes in cyclopropane formation

If the reaction is diluted with a large amount of an inert solvent such as C3F8 (perfl uoropropane) then :CH2 undergoes
more collisions before it reacts and so the chances of spin-fl ipping of singlet :CH2 to triplet :CH2 is increased. Addition
to alkenes is then less stereospecifi c.

Stereospecifi city (or lack of it) in the addition of a carbene to an alkene can be a good test of whether the carbene reacts
as a singlet or triplet: lack of stereospecifi city in a carbene addition almost certainly indicates that a triplet carbene is
involved, but the fact that an addition is stereospecifi c doesn’t mean that the carbene must be a singlet. In some cases,
bond rotation may be quite slow, and spin-fl ipping rapid, leading to stereospecifi c addition. Notice that in this example
the less stable cis (Z) alkene was used: the reaction will give the less encumbered trans-cyclopropane if it can.

The addition of a triplet carbene to an alkene can be considered to be rather like a radical addition to a double bond. The concerted addition of a singlet carbene, on the other hand, is a pericyclic reaction, and from Chapter 34 you should be able to classify it as a [1 + 2] cycloaddition.

As a cycloaddition, singlet carbene addition to an alkene must obey the rules of orbital symmetry discussed in Chapters 34 and 35. We might consider the empty p orbital of the carbene
(LUMO) interacting with the π bond (HOMO) of the alkene or the lone pair of the carbene in
its fi lled sp[2] orbital (HOMO) interacting with the π* antibonding orbital of the alkene (LUMO).

You can immediately see that there is a problem when we try to interact these orbitals constructively to build two new bonds—direct approach of the carbene to the alkene is impos sible
because there is always an antibonding interaction. Two new bonds can be formed, however,
if the carbene approaches the alkene in a ‘sideways-on’ manner.

The cyclopropane product must, of course, have a more or less tetrahedral arrangement
about the carbon atom that was the carbene so that, even if the carbene approaches in a

###### Making cyclopropanes

Many natural products and biologically active compounds contain cyclopropane rings: we
shall feature just a few. First, a most important natural insecticide, a pyrethrin from the East
African pyrethrum daisy, and its synthetic analogue decamethrin, one of the most important
insecticides in agriculture. Very low doses of this highly active and non-persistent insecticide
are needed.

The ‘ozone’ or ‘iodine’ smell of the sea has nothing to do with O3 or I2. It’s more likely a

gametes.
Other cyclopropanes include two natural but highly unusual amino acids. Hypoglycin is a
blood sugar level lowering agent from the unripe fruit of the ackee tree. It’s the causative agent
of Jamaican vomiting sickness. Don’t eat the green ackee.
The second and simpler amino acid is found in apples, pears, and grapefruit, and encourages
fruit ripening by degradation to ethylene.
Our last and most extraordinary example is an antifungal antibiotic fi rst synthesized in

Most chemical syntheses of compounds containing cyclopropyl groups make use of the
addition of a carbene, or carbene equivalent, to an alkene. What do we mean by carbene
equivalent? Usually, this is a molecule that has the potential to form a carbene, although it
may not actually react via a carbene intermediate. One such example is the zinc carbenoid
formed when diiodomethane reacts with zinc metal (most conveniently as a mixture with
copper—a ‘zinc–copper couple’). It reacts with alkenes just as a carbene would—it undergoes
addition to the π bond and produces a cyclopropane.

The reaction is known as the Simmons–Smith reaction, after the two chemists at the
DuPont chemical factory who discovered it in 1958. Even after several decades, it is the most
important way of making cyclopropane compounds, although nowadays a variant that uses
more easily handled starting materials is often used. Diethyl zinc replaces the Zn/Cu couple
of the traditional Simmons–Smith reaction. In this example, a double cyclopropanation on a
_C2 symmetric diene derived from tartaric acid gives very good stereoselectivity for reasons we_
will soon discuss.

Some of the evidence for this comes from a reaction that not only throws light on to the
mechanism of Simmons–Smith cyclopropanations, but makes them of even greater value in
synthesis. When an allylic alcohol is cyclopropanated, the new methylene group adds stereoselectively to the same face of the double bond as the hydroxyl group.

alcohols with m-CPBA mentioned

Allylic alcohols are also cyclopropanated over 100 times faster than their unfunctionalized
alkene equivalents. Coordination between the zinc atom and the hydroxyl group in the transition state explains both the stereoselectivity and the rate increase. Unfortunately, while the
Simmons–Smith reaction works well when a methylene (CH2) group is being transferred, it is
less good with substituted methylene groups (RCH: or R2C:).
The carbene derived by metal-catalysed decomposition of ethyl diazoacetate attacks alkenes
to introduce a two-carbon fragment into a cyclopropane—an industrial synthesis of ethyl
chrysan themate, a precursor to the pyrethrin insecticides (see p. 1016), uses this reaction. The
diene in the starting material is more nucleophilic (has a higher energy HOMO; see Chapter
19) than the single alkene in the product, so the reaction can be stopped after one carbene
addition.



- On the subject of
stereochemistry, note that the
Simmons–Smith zinc carbenoid
behaves like a singlet carbene—
its additions to alkenes are
stereospecifi c (the product
cyclopropane retains the
geometry of the alkene) as well
as stereoselective (the carbenoid
adds to the same face as the
hydroxyl group).

###### Comparison of ‘-enoid’ reagents

Before we leave this section on cyclopropanes, we want you to take a step back from simply thinking about carbenes,
and consider the types of reagents that form three-membered rings generally. They all have something in common, which
we could call ‘-enoid’ character. Cyclopropanes form when a carbene (which, in the singlet state, has an empty, electrophilic p orbital and a full, nominally nucleophilic sp[2] orbital) attacks alkenes. The Simmons–Smith carbenoid is not a
carbene, but nonetheless has a carbon atom with joint nucleophilic (alkyl zinc) and electrophilic (alkyl iodide) character.
When you think about it, the same is true for peracid epoxidation, which forms the oxygen analogue of a cyclopropane
by attacking an alkene using an oxygen atom bearing both a lone pair (nucleophilic) and a carboxylate leaving group
(electrophilic). It’s an ‘oxenoid’. In Chapter 27 you met other reagents that form cyclopropanes and epoxides by transferring CH2—sulfonium ylids. These yet again have a carbon atom carrying both a negative charge and a leaving group.
You can consider them to be particularly stable carbenoids.

###### Insertion into C–H bonds

We said that the formation of cyclopropanes by addition of substituted carbenes to alkenes was rare—in fact, alkyl-substituted carbenes undergo very few intermolecular reactions at all because they decompose very rapidly. When primary alkyl halides are treated
with base, alkenes are formed by elimination. Having read Chapter 17, you should expect


-----

the mechanism of this elimination to be E2 and, if you started with a deuterated compound like this, the alkene product would be labelled with two deuterium atoms at its
terminus.

This is indeed what happens if the base is sodium methoxide (pKa[MeOH] about 16). If,
however, it is phenylsodium (pKa[benzene] about 50), only 6% of the product is labelled in
this way while 94% of the product has only one deuterium atom.
Evidently a hydrogen atom has ‘migrated’ from the 2-position to the 1-position. The overall
mechanism of the elimination with very strong bases like phenylsodium is thought to be: (1)
formation of a carbene by α elimination and then (2) 1,2-migration of a hydrogen atom on to
the carbene centre. Carbenes with β hydrogens undergo extremely rapid 1,2-migration of
hydrogen to the carbene centre, giving alkenes.

step 1: α elimination step 2: 1,2-migration


Migrations were covered in
detail in Chapter 36. You met
examples there of migrations on to
electrophilic carbocationic centres,
but the reactions are in essence
very similar to these migrations to
carbenes.

The reason for the rapid migration is that the electrophilic carbene has found a nearby
source of electrons—the HOMO of the C–H bond—and it has grabbed the electrons for itself,
‘inserting’ into the C–H bond, as shown in the margin.
This type of reaction is better demonstrated by two examples in which the ‘insertion
reaction’ is a bit more obvious: when there are no β hydrogens, the carbene inserts
into C–H bonds a little further away in the same molecule or even in the solvent (cyclohexane in the second example). In the fi rst case, the carbene is formed by α elimination
(using one of the ‘Schlosser bases’, see p. 1008) and, in the second case, by photolysis of a
diazoketone.

- In principle, triplet carbene
insertions should follow a twostep radical pathway analogous
to their insertion into alkenes.
However, very few triplet carbene
insertions into C–H bonds have
been observed, and the
stereochemical consequence of
the two-step mechanism (which
should result in mixtures of
stereoisomers on insertion into a
C–H bond at a stereogenic
centre) has never been verifi ed.


In these C–H insertion reactions, the similarity with cyclopropane formation by insertion
into alkenes is clear, and the mechanisms mirror one another quite closely. As with the cyclopropanation reactions, the mechanism depends on whether the carbene is a singlet or triplet.
Singlet carbenes can insert in a concerted manner, with the orbitals overlapping constructively provided the carbene approaches side-on.

This mechanism implies that, if the C–H bond is at a stereogenic centre, the stereochemistry at that centre will be retained through the reaction, as in Cane’s synthesis of pentalenolactone (see box above). A nice example of this result is this ingenious synthesis of α-cuparenone
using a stereospecifi c carbene insertion.

The most common example of this type of migration is that in which the carbene is adjacent
to a carbonyl group. The initial product of what is known as the Wolff rearrangement is a
ketene, which cannot be isolated but is hydrolysed to the acid in the work-up. Wolff rearrangement is a typical result of heating diazoketones, although as you saw above (p. 1019) these
species also undergo intramolecular C–H insertion reactions.

One important application of this reaction is the chain extension of acyl chlorides to their

###### Nitrenes are the nitrogen analogues of carbenes

The Wolff rearrangement has some important cousins that we must now introduce to you—
they deserve a mention because they bear a family likeness even though they do not, in fact,
involve carbenes. They are a group of reactions that proceed through an intermediate nitrene—
the nitrogen analogue of a carbene. The simplest to understand, because it is the direct nitrogen analogue of the Wolff rearrangement, is the Curtius rearrangement. It starts with an acyl
azide, which can be made by nucleophilic substitution on an acyl chloride by sodium azide.
The acyl azide is what you would get if you just replaced the –CH=N2 of a diazoketone with
–N=N2. And, if you heat it, it is not surprising that it decomposes to release nitrogen (N2),
forming the nitrene. The nitrene N has only one bond and has two lone pairs, making six
electrons in all, like a carbene.

Nitrenes, like carbenes, are immensely reactive and electrophilic, and the same Wolff-style
migration (insertion into an adjacent C–C bond) takes place in which the substituent R
migrates from carbon to the electron-defi cient nitrogen atom of the nitrene. The product is an
_isocyanate. Isocyanates are unstable to hydrolysis: attack by water on the carbonyl group gives_
a carbamic acid, which decomposes to an amine. Alternatively, reaction with an alcohol gives
a carbamate. If the alcohol is BnOH, the product is a Cbz-protected amine.

Overall, then, the Curtius rearrangement converts an acid chloride (or an acid) to an amine
with loss of a carbon atom—very useful. Also useful is the related Hofmann rearrangement,
which turns an amide into an amine with loss of a carbon atom. This time we start with a
primary amide and make a nitrene by treatment with base and bromine. Notice how close this
nitrene-forming reaction is to the carbene-forming reactions we talked about on p. 1008. The
nitrene rearranges just as in the Curtius reaction, giving an isocyanate that can be hydrolysed
to the amine.

###### Attack of carbenes on lone pairs

Wolff rearrangements, involving shifts of alkyl groups, are effectively intramolecular insertions into C–C bonds. Carbenes will also insert into other bonds, especially O–H and N–H
bonds, although the mechanism in these cases involves initial attack on the lone pair of the
heteroatom.


Ylids (or ylides) are zwitterions
in which the charges are on
adjacent atoms—you met
phosphorus and sulfur ylids in
Chapter 27.

Carbene attack is followed by proton transfer to generate a neutral molecule from the fi rst
formed zwitterion (or ‘ylid’). However, if the heteroatom does not carry a hydrogen, the ylid
cannot rearrange in this way and this type of reaction is a very useful way of making reactive
ylids that are inaccessible by other means.
As carbonyl-substituted carbenes (like carbonyl-substituted radicals) are electrophilic, their
insertion into O–H and N–H bonds can be a useful way of making bonds in an umpolung
(polarity-reversed, see Chapter 28) sense. Because of the diffi culties in forming β-lactams (the
four-membered rings found in the penicillin classes of antibiotics), the pharamaceutical company Merck decided to design a synthesis of the class of compounds known as carbapenems
around a rhodium-catalysed carbene insertion into an N–H bond, building the fi ve-membered ring on to the side of the four-membered ring.

In this example, and in many before it, the formation of the carbene is initiated by a metal—
often copper, rhodium, or silver. The carbene intermediates in these reactions are formed as
reactive complexes with those metals, but in other cases the complexes are extremely stable.
For example, decomposition of phenyldiazomethane in the presence of a ruthenium(II) complex gives a carbene complex stable enough to be isolated and stored for months. This complex, and a family of related Ru complexes, are among the most important of carbene-derived
reagents because of a remarkable reaction known as alkene (or olefi n) metathesis.

The reaction is most easily understood when a simple diene reacts with a very small amount

What happens is a metathesis—an exchange of groups between the two arms of the molecule. But how? The mechanism is not diffi cult, but is unlike any other you have met before,
except, perhaps, the Wittig reaction, which also forms alkenes. First, the carbene complex
adds to one of the alkenes in what can be drawn as a [2 + 2] cycloaddition (Chapter 34) to give
a four-membered ring with the metal atom in the ring (a ‘metallacyclobutane’).

second metallacyclobutane. As before, there are two alternative ways for this metallacyclobutane to break down, and the productive one gives a third carbene complex and the cyclic

###### Metathesis catalysts

As you might imagine, the discovery of such a simple and effi cient way of making new C=C
bonds was a revolutionary point in organic chemistry, and earned a Nobel Prize in 2005 for
the three chemists instrumental in its development—Yves Chauvin, Richard Schrock, and
Robert Grubbs. The catalyst we have just been working with was developed by Grubbs and is
often known by his name. The early years of the 21st century also saw a rapid improvement
in the effectiveness of the catalysts used for metathesis. The most important development was
the discovery of alternatives to the phosphine ligands, a change which increases the activity
of the catalyst. The most important alternative ligands are themselves carbenes of the stable
‘N-heterocyclic’ type we introduced on p. 1006. Here is an important example, made by
deprotonation of a heterocyclic cation:

also represented as **Ar** **N** **N** **Ar** or, more commonly **Ar** **N** **N** **Ar**

There is a lot of delocalization in this structure, and usually these ligands are represented
with a curved line to show the donation of both nitrogen lone pairs to the carbene C atom.
You might prefer to include the formal + and – charges, but these compounds really do stretch
the classical valence bond representation almost to breaking point, and conventionally the
charges are not shown as they cancel out.
The remaining lone pair on carbon (which is not delocalized) can coordinate to Ru, just like
the phosphine lone pair, giving a catalyst known as ‘Grubbs II’ (the ‘second generation’ of the
‘Grubbs I’ we made use of in the metathesis described above). In another widely used catalyst
(known as the ‘Hoveyda–Grubbs catalyst’) the second phosphine is also replaced by intramolecular coordination.

###### Cross metathesis

The fi rst metathesis we introduced you to is known, for obvious reasons, as a ring closing
_metathesis reaction, and the formation of rings—even of diffi cult ring sizes (see Chapters 16_
and 31) is one of the supreme applications of metathesis chemistry. However, inter molecular
metathesis reactions can also work under certain circumstances, especially when the coupling partners have very different electronic or steric properties. The challenge is of course
avoiding each alkene coupling with itself. When one of the two partners is hindered and the
other isn’t, the cross metathesis reaction works well: the four carbons of the two alkenes
swap partners and a new alkene is produced (as its _E isomer), along with ethylene as a_
by-product.

It’s not diffi cult to understand why the less reactive and more hindered alkene doesn’t react
with itself, but why doesn’t the more reactive alkene just dimerize? The point is...it does! But
it doesn’t matter because even the dimer is reactive as a metathesis substrate, and can still go
on to form the product. All the metathesis steps proceed through the reversible [2 + 2] cycloaddition mechanisms you saw earlier.

###### Ene-yne metathesis

Before we leave metathesis, and carbenes, we need to introduce one fi nal reaction where
metathesis leads to a remarkable transformation. Metathesis works on any C=C π bond, but
the π bonds need not be an alkene—it can be an alkyne. The scheme below shows what happens: the two C=C double bonds change places. When an alkene reacts with an alkene, the
result is two new alkenes, but when an alkene reacts with an alkyne, there is still a single
bond remaining from the original alkyne, which ends up linking the two products together
as a diene.

- Notice that this time we
have started with the [Ru]=CH2
complex rather than

[Ru]=CHPh—in reality, as
shown on p. 1024, the very fi rst
time the cycle goes round, the
catalyst will transfer styrene, but
from then on the mechanism we
show will operate.


The mechanism follows exactly the same sequence of events as before. First the ruthenium
carbene catalyst undergoes [2 + 2] cycloaddition with the alkyne. The intermediate is now a
metallacyclobutene, and when the reverse [2 + 2] takes place the Ru carbene is still connected
to the alkene product.


Now the new carbene can undergo [2 + 2] cycloaddition and reverse [2 + 2] cycloaddition
again, this time with the alkene component, and out comes the diene, plus a Ru carbene ready
to start the cycle again.

Ene-yne metathesis is therefore a valuable way of constructing dienes—of the type you
might require for a Diels–Alder reaction, for example. Unlike more reactive organometallics
such as organolithiums and Grignard reagents, the Ru carbenes are fully compatible with
acidic NH and OH bonds and with electrophilic carbonyl groups. You will meet more of the
mild chemistry possible with organometallics in Chapter 40.

In the last few chapters we have concentrated a lot on what we call reactive intermediates,
species like radicals, carbenes, or carbocations that are hard to observe but that defi nitely
exist. Much of the evidence for their existence derives from the study of the mechanisms of
reactions. We have discussed some aspects of this as we have met the species concerned, but
in the next chapter we will look in detail at how mechanisms are elucidated and the methods
used to determine more precisely the structure of reactive intermediates.

###### There are mechanisms and there are mechanisms

There are two types of answer to the question ‘What is the mechanism of this reaction?’. If
you were asked to draw the mechanism of an ester hydrolysis in basic solution you should
have no trouble in giving a good answer of the fi rst type. It wouldn’t matter if you had never
seen this particular ester before or even if you knew that it had never actually been made,
because you would recognize that the reaction belonged to a class of well-known reactions
(carbonyl substitution reactions, Chapter 10) and you would assume that the mechanism was
the same as that for other ester hydrolyses. And you would be right—nucleophilic attack on
the carbonyl group to form a tetrahedral intermediate is followed by loss of the alkoxide leaving group and formation of the anion of the carboxylic acid.

You might also recall from Chapter 12 that, if we change the carbonyl compound to an acid
chloride, the mechanism may change to an SN1 reaction with an acylium ion intermediate
because the leaving group is now much better: Cl[−] is more stable (less basic) than RO[−]. It
would not be worth using hydroxide for this reaction: as the fi rst step is the slow step, water
will do just as well. Again someone had to determine this mechanism, had to show which
was the slow step, and had to show that leaving group ability depended on the pKa of its
conjugate base.

If the reaction were the hydrolysis of an amide, you might remember from Chapter 12 that
third-order kinetics are often observed for the expulsion of such bad leaving groups and that
this extra catalysis makes it worthwhile using concentrated base. Again, someone had to fi nd
out that: (1) the slow step is now the decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate, (2) there
are third-order kinetics involving two molecules of hydroxide, and (3) the fi rst molecule acts
as a nucleophile and the second as a base.

These three mechanisms are all versions of the same reaction. For you, writing these
mechanisms chiefl y means recognizing the type of reaction (nucleophilic substitution at
the carbonyl group) and evaluating how good the leaving group is. For the original chemists, determining these reaction mechanisms meant: (1) determining exactly what the
product is (that may sound silly, but it is a serious point), (2) discovering how many steps
there are and the structures of the intermediates, (3) fi nding out which is the slow (ratedetermining) step, and (4) fi nding any catalysis. This chapter describes the methods used
in this kind of work—the detailed, second type of answer to ‘What is the mechanism of
this reaction?’.
Now, suppose you were asked what the mechanisms of the next two reactions might be.
This is a rather different sort of problem as you may well not recognize any of these reagents
and you probably cannot fi t any of the reactions into one of the classes you have seen so far.
You may not even see at once which of the three main classes of mechanism you should use:
ionic, pericyclic, or radical.

You may do your best to write a mechanism based on your understanding of organic chemistry, moving the electrons from nucleophiles to electrophiles, choosing sensible intermediates, and arriving at the right products. You would not claim any authority for the result, but
you would hope, as an organic chemist, to propose one or more reasonable possibilities.
This process of proposing reasonable mechanisms is actually an essential preliminary to
answering the question in the second way—fi nding the real, experimentally verifi ed, mechanism for the reaction. We will now look at some of the techniques used to fi nd such answers
with an old curiosity of a reaction, the Cannizzaro reaction, as an example.


-----

###### Determining reaction mechanisms: the Cannizzaro reaction

So how do we know the mechanism of a reaction? The simple answer is that we don’t for certain. Organic chemists have to face situations where the structure of a compound is initially
thought to be one thing but later corrected to be something different. The same is true of
mechanisms. It is the nature of science that all we can do is try to account for observations by
proposing a hypothesis. We then test the hypothesis by experiment and, when the experiment does not fi t the hypothesis, we must start again with a new hypothesis. This is exactly
the case with mechanisms. When a new reaction is discovered, one or more mechanisms are
proposed; evidence is then sought for and against these mechanisms until one emerges as the
best choice. That one then remains the accepted mechanism for the reaction until fresh evidence comes along that does not fi t the mechanism.
We are going to look at one reaction, the Cannizzaro reaction, and use this to introduce the
different techniques used in elucidating mechanisms so that you will be able to appreciate
the different information each experiment brings to light and how all the pieces fi t together
to leave us with a probable mechanism. Under strongly basic conditions, an aldehyde with
no α hydrogens undergoes disproportionation to give half alcohol and half carboxylate.
Disproportionation means one half of the sample is oxidized by the other half, which is itself
reduced. In this case, half the aldehyde reduces the other half to the primary alcohol and in
the process is oxidized to the carboxylic acid. Before the discovery of LiAlH4 in 1946, this was
one of the few reliable ways to reduce aldehydes and so was of some use in synthesis.
Here is a simple mechanistic scheme of what happens—the sort of thing you might reasonably propose if you had not seen the reaction before.

It’s not the only possible mechanism by any means—and you may spot that it is slightly
different from the one in Chapter 26, where we showed a dianion as an intermediate. We’ll
now work through some of the alternative mechanisms that have been proposed for the
Cannizzaro reaction, along with the evidence for or against them. Most of these alternatives
have been eliminated, leaving just the ones you have already met. Finally, we will see that
even these mechanisms do not explain everything absolutely.

###### Proposed mechanism A: a radical mechanism

Early on it was thought that the hydrogen transfer might be taking place via a radical chain
reaction. If this were the case, then the reaction should go faster if radical initiators are added
and it should slow down when radical inhibitors are added. When this was tried, there was no
change in the rate, so this proposed mechanism was ruled out.

###### Kinetic evidence for an ionic mechanism

The fi rst piece of evidence that must be accounted for is the rate law. For the reaction of benzaldehyde with hydroxide, the reaction is fi rst order with respect to hydroxide ions and second
order with respect to benzaldehyde (third order overall).

rate = k4[PhCHO][2][HO[−]]

For some aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and furfural, the order with respect to the concentration of hydroxide varies between one and two depending on the exact conditions. In
high concentrations of base it is fourth order.

rate = k4[RCHO][2][HO[−]][2]


**O**


**H**


2-furaldehyde
(furfural)


-----

At lower concentrations of base the rate law is a mixture of both third- and fourth-order
terms.

rate = k3[RCHO][2][HO[−]] + k4[RCHO][2][HO[−]][2]

Just because the overall order of reaction is third or fourth order, it does not mean that all
the species must simultaneously collide in the rate-determining step. You saw in Chapter 12
that the rate law actually reveals all the species that are involved up to and including the ratedetermining step.

###### Isotopic labelling

When the reaction is carried out in D2O instead of in H2O it is found that there are no C–D
bonds in the products. This tells us that the hydrogen must come from the aldehyde and not
from the solvent.

###### Proposed mechanism B: formation of an intermediate dimeric adduct

A possible mechanism that fi ts all the experimental evidence so far involves nucleophilic attack
of the usual tetrahedral intermediate on another aldehyde to give an intermediate adduct. This
adduct could then form the products directly by hydride transfer. You may not like the look of
this last step, but the mechanism was proposed and evidence is needed to disprove it.

Which step would be rate determining for this mechanism? It could not be step 1 since, if
this were the case, the rate law would be fi rst order with respect to the aldehyde rather than
the observed second-order relationship. Also, if the reaction is carried out in water labelled
with oxygen-18, the oxygen in the benzaldehyde exchanges with the [18]O from the solvent
much faster than the Cannizzaro reaction takes place. This can only be because of a rapid
equilibrium in step 1 and so step 1 cannot be rate determining.

So, for mechanism B, either step 2 or step 3 could be rate determining—either case would fi t
the observed rate law. Step 2 is similar to step 1: in both cases an oxyanion nucleophile attacks
the aldehyde. Since the equilibrium in step 1 is very rapid, it is reasonable to suggest that the
equilibrium in step 2 should also be rapid and thus that the hydride transfer in step 3 must be
rate determining. So mechanism B can fi t the rate equation.
How can mechanism B be ruled out? One way is to change the attacking nucleophile. The
Cannizzaro reaction works equally well if methoxide is used in a mixture of methanol and
water. If mechanism B were correct, the reaction with methoxide would be as follows.

One of the products would be different by this mechanism: benzyl methyl ether would be
formed instead of benzyl alcohol. None is observed experimentally. Moreover, under the conditions of the experiment, benzyl methyl ether does not react to form benzyl alcohol, so it
cannot be the case that the ether is formed but then reacts to form the products. Mechanism
B can therefore be ruled out.

###### Proposed mechanism C: formation of an ester intermediate

This mechanism is like mechanism B but the hydride transfer in the adduct formed in step 2
displaces OH[−] to form an ester (benzyl benzoate) that is then hydrolysed to the products. This
was at one time held to be the correct mechanism for the Cannizzaro reaction. One piece of
evidence for this, and at fi rst glance a very good one, is that by cooling the reaction mixture
and avoiding excess alkali, some benzyl benzoate could be isolated during the reaction. An
important point is that this does not mean that the ester must be an intermediate in the reaction—it might be formed at the end of the reaction, for example. However, it does mean that
any mechanism we propose must be able to account for its formation. For now though we
want to try to establish whether the ester is an intermediate rather than a by-product in the
Cannizzaro reaction.

enough. When someone actually tried it under the conditions of the experiment, they
found that benzyl benzoate is very rapidly hydrolysed (the moral here is ‘don’t just think
about it, try it!’). However, just because the ester could be hydrolysed, it still did not show
that it actually was an intermediate in the reaction. How this was eventually shown was
rather clever. The argument goes like this. We can measure the rate constant for step 4 by
seeing how quickly pure benzyl benzoate is hydrolysed to benzyl alcohol and benzoate
under the same conditions as those of the Cannizzaro reaction. We also know how quickly
these products are formed during the Cannizzaro reaction itself. Since, if this mechanism
is correct, the only way the products are formed is from this intermediate, it is possible to
work out how much of the intermediate ester must be present at any time to give the
observed rate of formation of the products. If we can measure the amount of ester that is
actually present and it is signifi cantly less than that which we predict, then this cannot be
the correct mechanism. It turned out that there was never enough ester present to account
for the formation of the products in the Cannizzaro reaction and mechanism C could be
ruled out.

###### The correct mechanism for the Cannizzaro reaction

The only mechanism that has not been ruled out and that appears to fi t all the evidence is the
one we have already given (p. 1031). The fact that the rate law for this mechanism is overall
third and sometimes fourth order depending on the aldehyde and the conditions can be
explained by the involvement of a second hydroxide ion deprotonating the tetrahedral intermediate to give a dianion. When methoxide is used in a methanol/water mix, some methyl
ester is formed. This does not stay around for long—under the conditions of the experiment
it is quickly hydrolysed to the carboxylate.

###### Even this mechanism does not quite fi t all the evidence

We said earlier that we can never prove a mechanism—only disprove it. Unfortunately, just as
the ‘correct’ mechanism seems to be found, there are some observations that make us doubt
this mechanism. In Chapter 37 you saw how a technique called electron spin resonance
**(ESR) (or electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR) detects radicals and gives some information**
about their structure. When the Cannizzaro reaction was carried out with benzaldehyde and
a number of substituted benzaldehydes in an ESR spectrometer, a radical was detected. For
each aldehyde used, the ESR spectrum proved to be identical to that formed when the aldehyde was reduced using sodium metal. The radical formed was the radical anion of the
aldehyde.

Our mechanism does not explain this result, but small amounts of radicals are formed in
many reactions in which the products are actually formed by simple ionic processes. Detection
of a species in a reaction mixture does not prove that it is an intermediate. Few chemists think
that radicals are involved in the Cannizzaro reaction. Most think the mechanism we have
given is correct.

###### Variation in the structure of the aldehyde

Before leaving the Cannizzaro reaction, look at these rates of reactions for aromatic aldehydes
with different substituents in the _para position. These aldehydes may be divided into two_
classes: those that react faster than unsubstituted benzaldehyde and those that react more
slowly. Those that go slower all have something in common—they all have substituents on
the ring that donate electrons.

Rate of Cannizzaro reaction with aromatic aldehydes

R = Rate relative to Rate relative to
benzaldehyde at 25°C benzaldehyde at 100°C

H 1 1

Me 0.2 0.2

MeO 0.05 0.1

Me2N very slow 0.0004

NO2 210 2200

We have already seen how substituents on a benzene ring affect the rate of electrophilic
substitution (Chapter 21). Electron-donating groups such as MeO and Me2N dramatically
speed up the rate at which an aromatic ring is attacked by an electrophile, whereas electronwithdrawing groups, particularly nitro groups, slow the reaction down. The Cannizzaro reaction is not taking place on the benzene ring itself, but substituents on the ring still make their
presence known. The fact that the Cannizzaro reaction goes much _slower with electron-_
donating groups and faster with electron-withdrawing groups tells us that, for this reaction,
rather than a positive charge developing, as in the case of electrophilic substitution on an
aromatic ring, there must be negative charge accumulating somewhere near the ring. The
accumulation of more negative charge is disfavoured by the presence of a group that is already
offl oading electron density into the ring. In agreement with this, our mechanism has monoand dianion intermediates, which are stabilized by electron-withdrawing groups and destabilized by electron-donating groups.

The rest of the chapter is devoted to discussions of methods similar to those we have briefl y
surveyed for the Cannizzaro reaction, with examples of the use of each method. You can
assume that the mechanisms we have discussed in this book have been verifi ed (not, of course,
proved) by these sorts of methods.

###### Be sure of the structure of the product

This seems a rather obvious point. However, there is a lot to be learned from the detailed
structure of the product: its connectivity (which atom goes where) as well as its stereochemistry. You will see that it may be necessary to alter the structure of the starting material in
subtle ways to make sure that we know exactly what happens to all its atoms by the time it
reaches the product.
Suppose you are studying the addition of HCl to this alkene. You fi nd that you get a good
yield of a single adduct and you might be a bit surprised that you do not get a mixture of the
two obvious adducts. You may wonder if there is some participation of the ether oxygen or
whether perhaps the ketone enolizes during the reaction and controls the outcome.

If you are cautious you might check on the structure of the product before you start a
mechanistic investigation. The NMR spectrum (above) tells you at once that the product is
neither of these suggestions. It contains a (CH2)3Cl unit and can no longer have an eightmembered ring. A ring contraction has given a fi ve-membered ring and a mechanistic investigation is hardly needed. Simply knowing what the product is allows us to propose a
mechanism. A rearrangement has occurred and we could use the method suggested in Chapter
36: number the atoms in the starting material and fi nd them in the product. This is quite easy
as only one numbering system makes any sense.

This numbering suggests that the carbon skeleton is unaffected by the reaction, that

straightforward.

It may be disappointing to fi nd that every step in this mechanism is well known and that
the reaction is exactly what we ought to have expected with an eight-membered ring as these
rings are famous for their transannular (across-ring) reactions to form 5/5 fused systems.
However, it is good that a prolonged investigation is not necessary.

A more subtle distinction occurred in a study of the bromination of alkynes. Bromination
of benzyl alkynes in acetic acid gave the products of addition of one molecule of bromine—
the 1,2-dibromoalkenes. The reaction was successful with a variety of para substituents and
there seems at fi rst to be no special interest in the structure of the products.

Closer investigation revealed an extraordinary difference between them, not at all obvious
from their NMR spectra: the compound from X=OMe was the Z-dibromoalkene from cis addition of bromine while the product from X=CF3 was the E alkene from trans addition. What
mechanism could explain this difference?

The anti addition is more easily explained: it is the result of formation of a bromonium ion,
similar, in fact, to the normal mechanism for the bromination of alkenes. Bromine adds from
one side of the alkene and the bromide ion must necessarily form the _E-dibromo product_
regardless of which atom it attacks.

So why does the p-methoxy-substituted compound behave differently? It cannot react by
the same mechanism and a reasonable explanation is that the much more electron-donating
ring participates in the reaction to give a carbocyclic three-membered ring intermediate that
is attacked in an anti fashion to give the Z alkene. Both intermediates are three-membered
ring cations and both are attacked with inversion but the p-MeO compound undergoes double inversion by participation of the ring.

###### Labelling experiments reveal the fate of individual atoms

It often happens that the atoms in starting material and product cannot be correlated without
at least one of them being labelled. The fact that many elements exist as different isotopes
provides us with a perfect way of doing this: a neutron more or less in the nucleus affects the
physics (and hence the spectroscopic features) of an atom, but not its chemistry.
The isomerization of Z-1-phenylbutadiene to the E diene in acid looks like a simple reaction.
Protonation of the Z alkene would give a stabilized secondary benzylic cation that should last
long enough to rotate. Loss of the proton would then give the more stable E diene.

However, reaction with D[+] in D2O reveals that this mechanism is incorrect. The product
contains substantial amounts of deuterium at C4, not at C2 as predicted by the proposed
mechanism. Protonation must occur at the end of the conjugated system to produce the more
stable conjugated cation, which rotates about the same bond and loses H or D from C4 to give
the product. More H than D will be lost, partly because there are two Hs and only one D, but
also because of the kinetic isotope effect, of which more later.

the kinetic isotope effect means
that isotopes of an element can
have subtly different chemistry,
as we will explain on p. 1050.

The easiest labels to use for this job are D for H, [13]C, and [18]O. None of these is radioactive; all
can be found by mass spectrometry, while D and [13]C can be found by NMR. Older work on
mechanisms used radioactive tracers such as T (tritium, [3]H) for H and [14]C.
The fi rst evidence for benzyne as the intermediate in the reaction of chlorobenzene with
NH2− came from radioactive labelling. If benzyne is an intermediate, the product should have
50% label at C1 and 50% at the two identical ortho carbons, as the scheme below shows.

The labelled aniline was degraded by the reactions shown here, which you must agree was
a lot of work for the chemists concerned. Each potentially labelled carbon atom had to be
isolated from any other labelled atom and the radioactivity measured. We shall follow the fate
of the two labelled atoms with black and green spots. Since the two ortho positions are identical, we must put a black spot on both of them.

dicarboxylic acid is not a standard procedure and is not recommended. All the label came out
in the CO2 and almost exactly half of it was from the black and half from the green labelled
carbons. This was the original evidence that convinced organic chemists in 1953 that benzyne
was involved in the reaction. The evidence presented in Chapter 22 is much more modern.

###### The value of double labelling experiments

An altogether more modern approach to a labelling study was used in the surprising
rearrangement of a hydroxy-acid in acidic solution. The structure of the product suggests
a CO2H migration as the most likely mechanism. This mechanism resembles closely the
cationic rearrangements of Chapter 36.

But there are other possibilities: received wisdom (Chapter 36) suggests that the best migrating group in cationic rearrangements is the one best able to bear a positive charge, by which
logic the more familiar Ph and Me migrations ought to be preferred. A more elaborate mechanism can be written: it involves two methyl migrations and one phenyl migration and it also
needs consideration.

- We don’t normally see [13]C–

13C coupling because in most
molecules only 1.1% of the C
atoms are [13]C, so there’s little
chance of two of them fi nding
themselves adjacent to one
another. But when both C
atoms are always [13]C, the
coupling becomes evident.


**OH**


These mechanisms can be tested by fi nding out whether the CO2H group remains attached
to its original position or becomes attached to the other carbon in the skeleton of the molecule. This can be done by double labelling. If a compound is prepared with two [13]C labels, one
on the CO2H group itself and one on the benzylic carbon, the NMR spectrum of the product
will show what has happened. In fact, the two [13]C labels end up next to each other with a
coupling constant [1]JCC = 71 Hz. It is the CO2H group that has migrated.

So why does the CO2H group migrate? It does so not because it is a good migrating group,
but because it cannot bear to be left behind. The rearranged cation from CO2H migration is a
stable tertiary alkyl cation. The cation from Me migration is a very unstable cation, with the
positive charge next to the CO2H group. Such cations are unknown as the carbonyl group is
very electron withdrawing.

###### ‘Crossover’ experiments

There is still one tiny doubt. Supposing the reaction is not intramolecular at all, but intermolecular. The CO2H group might be lost from one molecule as protonated CO2 and be picked up
by another molecule of alkene. No migration would be involved at all.

This mechanism can be checked by using a 50:50 mixture of doubly labelled and
unl abelled starting material. The molecule of alkene that captures the roving protonated
labelled CO2 might happen to be labelled too but equally well it might be unlabelled. If
this last mechanism is correct, we should get a mixture of unlabelled, singly labelled, and
doubly labelled product in the ratio 1:2:1 as there are two types of singly labelled product.
The two singly labelled compounds are called the crossover products and the experiment
is called a crossover experiment as it discovers whether any parts of one molecule cross
over to another.


There is an example of a
crossover experiment proving that
an SN2 reaction is intermolecular in
Chapter 31, p. 811 and one
proving the mechanism of a
rearrangement on pp. 959–960.

In fact, no singly labelled compounds were found: NMR analysis showed that the product
consisted entirely of unlabelled or doubly labelled molecules. The CO2H group remains
attached to the same molecule (though not to the same atom) and the fi rst mechanism is
correct.
Crossover experiments demand some sort of double labelling, which does not have to be
isotopic. An example where crossover products are observed is the light-initiated isomerization of allylic sulfi des.

This is formally a [1,3] sigmatropic shift of sulfur (Chapter 35) but that is an unlikely mechanism (and you should be able to suggest why). A crossover experiment was carried out in
which the two molecules had either two phenyl groups or two para-tolyl groups. The mixture
was allowed to rearrange in daylight and the products were examined by mass spectroscopy.
There was a roughly 1:2:1 mixture of products having two phenyl groups, one phenyl and one

Clearly, the ArS group had become separated from the rest of the molecule and the most

is in equilibrium and the more highly substituted alkene is the product.

###### Systematic structural variation

In this last example, the hope is that the para-methyl group will have too weak an electronic
or steric effect and in any case will be too far away to affect the outcome. It is intended to make
nearly as slight a change in the structure as an isotopic label. Many structural investigations
have exactly the opposite hope. Some systematic change is made in the structure of the molecule in the expectation of a predictable change in rate. A faster or slower reaction will lead to
some defi nite conclusion about the charge distribution in the transition state.
Allylic compounds can react effi ciently with nucleophiles by either the SN1 or SN2 mechanisms (Chapter 15). Here are two examples.

**H2O** **NaI**

**OMs** **OH** **Cl** **I**
aqueous acetone
acetone

The carbon skeleton is the same in both reactions but the leaving groups and the nucleophiles
are different. These reactions might both go by SN1 or SN2 or one might go by SN1 and the other
by SN2. One way to fi nd out is to make a large change in the electronic nature of the carbon
skeleton and see what happens to the rate of each reaction. In these experiments one of the
methyl groups was changed for a CF3 group—exchanging a weakly electron-donating group for
a strongly electron-withdrawing group. If a cation is an intermediate, as in the SN1 reaction, the
fl uorinated compound will react much more slowly. Here is the result in the fi rst case.

**H2O** **H2O**

**OMs** **OH** **F3C** **OMs** **F3C** **OH**

aqueous aqueous
acetone acetone

relative rate = 1.0 relative rate = 1.8 × 10[–6]


The fl uorinated compound reacts half a million times more slowly so this looks very much
like an SN1 mechanism. The slow step in an SN1 mechanism is the formation of a carbocation
so any group that destabilizes the positive charge would have (and evidently does have) a large
effect on the rate. Rate ratios of several powers of ten often are worth noticing and a rate ratio
of nearly 10[6] is considerable. In the second case the rate difference is much less.

**NaI** **NaI**

**Cl** acetone **I** **F3C** **Cl** acetone **F3C** **I**

relative rate = 1.0 relative rate = 11.0

A rate ratio of 11 is not worth noticing. The point is not that the fl uorinated compound
reacts faster but that the two compounds react at about the same rate. This strongly suggests
that no charge is generated in the transition state and an SN1 mechanism is not happening.
The SN2 mechanism makes good sense with its concerted bond formation and bond breaking
requiring no charge on the carbon skeleton.

SN2 transition state

The CF3 group works well here as a mechanistic probe because it is held well out of the way
of the reaction site by a rigid π system but is connected electronically by that same allylic
system. Steric effects should be minimized and electronic effects clearly seen. This approach
is clearly limited by the small number of groups having properties like those of the CF3 group
and the small number of reactions having such favourable carbon skeletons. We will now
present the most important serious correlation between structure and reactivity.

###### The Hammett relationship

What we would ideally like to do is fi nd a way to quantify the effects that electron-donating
or -withdrawing groups have on the transition state or intermediate during the course of a
reaction. This will then give us an idea of what the transition state is really like. The fi rst question is: can we defi ne exactly how effi cient a given group is at donating or withdrawing electrons? Hammett took the arbitrary decision to use the pKa of an acid as a guide. For example,
the rate of hydrolysis of esters might well correlate with the pKa of the corresponding acid.


Louis P. Hammett (1894–1987)
invented ‘physical organic chemistry’ and at Columbia University
in 1935 derived the Hammett
σ/ρ relationship. The impact was
enormous and in the 1960s
chemists were still working out
more such correlations.

When Hammett plotted the rates of ethyl ester hydrolyses (as
log k since pKa has a log scale) against the pKas of the corresponding acids, the initial results were not very encouraging as there
was a random scatter of points over the whole graph.

Hammett had used some aliphatic acids (substituted acetic acids)
and some aromatic acids (substituted benzoic acids) and he noticed
that many of the points towards the top of the graph belonged to
the substituted acetic acids. Removing them (brown points) made
the graph a lot better. He then noticed that the remaining aromatic
compounds were in two classes: the ortho-substituted esters reacted
more slowly than their meta- and para-isomers and came towards
the bottom of the graph (orange points). Removing them made
the graph quite good (remaining green points).

It was not a perfect correlation but Hammett had removed the
examples where steric hindrance was important. Aliphatic compounds can adopt a variety of conformations (Chapter 16) and
the substituent in some of them will interfere with the reaction.
Similarly, in ortho-substituted aromatic compounds the nearby
substituent might exert steric hindrance on the reaction. Only
with meta- and para-substituted compounds was the substituent
held out of the way, on a rigid framework, and in electronic communication with the reaction site through the fl at but conjugated benzene ring.
Notice that the straight line is not perfect. This graph is an
invention of the human mind. It is a correlation between things
that are not directly related. If you determine a rate constant by
plotting the right function of concentration against time and
get an imperfect straight line, that is your fault because you
haven’t done your measurements carefully enough. If you make
a Hammett plot and the points are not on a straight line (and
they won’t be) then that is not your fault. The points really don’t
fi t on a perfectly straight line. As you will see soon, this doesn’t
actually matter.

###### The Hammett substituent constant σσ

A quick glance at the pKas of some substituted benzoic acids in the table below will show
how well they correlate electron donation with pKa. The substituents at the top of the table
are electron donating and the anions of the benzoic acids are correspondingly less stable
so these are the weakest acids. At the bottom of the table we have the electron-withdrawing
groups, which stabilize the anion and make the acid stronger. The whole range is not
that great, only one pH unit or so, because the carboxylate anion is not conjugated with
the ring.
Hammett decided not to use the pKas themselves for his correlation but defi ned a new
parameter, which he called σ. This σ shows how electron donating or withdrawing a group is
relative to H as a difference between the pKas of a benzoic acid derivative with the substituent
and benzoic acid itself. If the acid required to determine σ for a new substituent was not available, σ could be determined by correlation with other reactions. Here are the equations and
the table of σ values for the most important substituents. A different value of σ for any given
substituent was needed for the meta and the para positions and these are called σm and σp,
respectively.

σX = log ⎛⎝[⎜] _KKa_ a(XC H COOH)(C H COOH)66 54 ⎞⎠[⎟] = pKa(C H COOH) p6 5 − _Ka(XC6H COOH)4_

electrons have positive σ

There is no point learning the precise fi gures in this table, but it will help if you form a
general idea of what a σ value means. If σ = 0 the substituent has no effect: it is electronically
the same as H. If σ is positive, the substituent is electron withdrawing. This is unfortunate
perhaps, but just remember that the comparison is with acid strength, and acids with electron-withdrawing substituents are stronger. Positive σ means a stronger acid so the substituent is electron withdrawing. The more positive the charge induced on the ring by a
substituent, the larger its σ value. Negative σ means weaker acid and electron donation.
Inductive effects from polarization of σ bonds are greater for σm than for σp because the substituent is nearer.


-----

Conjugation is generally more effective in the para position (see Chapter 21) so σp  - σm for
conjugating substituents. Indeed, the NH2 group has a large negative σp and a zero σm. The
NH2 group donates electrons strongly to the carbonyl group of benzoic acid from the para
position but does not conjugate in the meta position where its donation happens just to balance the effect of electronegative nitrogen.
The OMe group has a negative σp but a positive σm because a weaker electron donation
from the lone pairs is more important in the para position but the effect of very electronegative oxygen on the σ framework of the ring in the meta position is more important than lone
pair donation that doesn’t reach the carbonyl group. You do not need to learn any σ values
but you should be able to work out the sign of σ for well-known substituents and estimate a
rough value.

###### The Hammett reaction constant ρρ

Now we can return to our reaction: the alkaline hydrolysis of various _meta- and_ _para-_
substituted ethyl benzoates. We sketched the graph earlier (p. 1041) but now we can add
some more quantitative detail. The rate constants for this second-order reaction have
been measured and shown here is a graph of log (kX/kH) versus σ, where kX is the rate constant for the reaction with the substituted benzoate and kH is that for the unsubstituted
reaction (X=H).

From the graph for the

you can see that the p-NO2

the p-NH2 benzoate hydrolyses
some 10[2] times slower.

We can see straight away that there is a good correlation between how fast the reaction goes
and the value of σ; in other words, the points lie more or less on a straight line. The gradient
of this best-fi t line, given the symbol ρ (rho), tells us how sensitive the reaction is to substituent effects in comparison with the ionization of benzoic acids. The gradient is ρ = +2.6. This
tells us that the reaction responds to substituent effects in the same way (because it is +) as the
ionization of benzoic acids but by much more (10[1.6] times more) because it is 2.6 instead of 1.0.
We already know what the mechanism of this reaction is:

The fi rst step is quite like the ionization of benzoic acid. A negative charge is appearing on
the carbonyl oxygen atom and that negative charge will be stabilized by electron-withdrawing X groups. If the fi rst step is rate determining, a positive ρ makes sense.
We need now to look at some other reactions to get a grasp of the meaning of the value of
the Hammett ρ.

###### Equilibria with positive Hammett ρ values

To take a simple example, let’s just see what happens to ρ if we simply move the carboxylic
acid away from the ring. The ρ value for ionization gets less. This is just what you would
expect—the further it is from the aromatic ring, the less the acid cares about how electron
rich or poor the ring is. With two saturated carbons between the benzene ring and the carboxylic acid, there is almost no effect on pKa. But restore electronic communications with a double bond, and ρ goes back up again.

If the negative charge on the anion can actually be delocalized round the ring, as it can in
substituted phenols, we should expect the size of ρ to increase. Both the phenol and the anion
are delocalized but delocalization is more important for the anion. The effect is even more
signifi cant for the ionization of anilinium salts as the acid ArNH3+ does not have a delocalized
lone pair but the conjugate base (ArNH2) does.

determining step is going to have a ρ value of about 2–3, the same as for the hydrolysis of
esters, as we have already seen. Large positive ρ values usually indicate extra electrons in the
transition state delocalized into the ring itself. A classic example is nucleophilic aromatic
substitution by the addition–elimination mechanism (Chapter 22). The ρ value is +4.9, but
even this large value does not mean a complete anion on the benzene ring as the nitro group,
present in all cases, takes most of the negative charge. The substituent X merely helps.

###### Reactions with negative Hammett ρ values

Negative ρ values mean electrons fl owing away from the ring. A representative example is the
SN2 displacement of iodide from EtI by phenoxide anions. This has a ρ value of exactly –1.0.
Although the transition state has a negative charge, that charge is decreasing on the aromatic
ring as the starting material approaches the transition state.

An SN1 reaction on the carbon atom next to the ring has a large negative ρ value. In this
example, a tertiary benzylic cation is the intermediate and the rate-determining step is, of
course, the formation of the cation. The cation is next to the ring but delocalized round it and
the ρ value is –4.5, about the same value, though negative, as that for the nucleophilic substitution on nitrobenzenes by the addition–elimination mechanism that we saw in the last
section.

The largest negative ρ values come from electrophilic aromatic substitution (Chapter 21),
where the electrons of the ring are used in the reaction, leaving a positive charge on the ring
itself in the intermediate. Some of this charge is already there in the transition state. This
simple nitration has ρ = –6.4 and ρ values for electrophilic aromatic substitution are usually
in the range –5 to –9. Negative ρ values mean electrons fl owing out of the ring.

###### Reactions with small Hammett ρ values

Small Hammett ρ values arise in three ways. The aromatic ring being used as a probe for the
mechanism may simply be too far away for the result to be signifi cant. This trivial case of the
alkaline hydrolysis of the 3-aryl propionate ester has a ρ value of + 0.5 and it is surprising that
it is even that large.

The second case is the informative one where the reaction is not dependent on electrons
fl owing into or out of the ring. Pericyclic reactions are important examples and the Diels–
Alder reaction of arylbutadienes with maleic anhydride shows a small negative ρ value of –0.6.
The small value is consistent with a mechanism not involving charge accumulation or dispersal, but the sign is interesting. We explained this type of Diels–Alder reaction in Chapter 34
by using the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the dienophile. The negative sign of ρ,
small though it is, supports this view because the reaction is somewhat faster with electrondonating groups on Ar, which raise the energy of the HOMO of the diene.

The third case is in many ways the most interesting. We have seen that the alkaline
hydrolysis of ethyl esters of benzoic acids (ArCO2Et) has a ρ value of +2.6 and that this is a
reasonable value for a reaction involving nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group conjugated with the aromatic ring. The hydrolysis of the same esters in acid solution, which also
involves nucleophilic attack on the same carbonyl group, has a ρ value of +0.1. In other
words, substituted benzoic esters hydrolyse at more or less the same rate in acid solution,
irrespective of their substituents. We need to look at the full mechanism to explain this
remarkable result.

Steps 1, 3, and 5 cannot be slow as they are just proton transfers between oxygen atoms, and
proton transfer between electronegative atoms is always fast. That leaves only steps 2 and 4 as
possible rate-determining steps. The bimolecular addition of the weak nucleophile water to
the low concentration of protonated ester (step 2) is the most attractive candidate, as step
4—the unimolecular loss of ethanol and re-formation of the carbonyl group—should be fast.
What ρ value would be expected for the reaction if step 2 were the rate-determining step? It
would be made up of two parts. There would be an equilibrium ρ value for the protonation
step and a reaction ρ value for the addition of water. Step 1 involves electrons fl owing out of
the molecule and step 2 involves electrons fl owing in so the ρ values for these two steps would


-----

have opposite charges. We know that the ρ value for step 2 would be about +2.5 (it’s just like
the step in the ester hydrolysis) and a value of about –2.5 for the equilibrium protonation is
reasonable. This is indeed the explanation: step 2 is the rate-determining step and the ρ values
for steps 1 and 2 almost cancel each other out. All steps before the rate-determining step are
present in the rate equation and also affect the Hammett ρ value.

You should not, of course, learn the numbers in this scheme, but you need an idea of roughly
what each group of values means. You should see now why it is unimportant whether the
Hammett correlation gives a good straight line or not. We just want to know whether ρ is + or –
and whether it is, say, 3 or 6. It is meaningless to debate the signifi cance of a ρ value of 3.4 as
distinct from one of 3.8.

###### Using the Hammett ρ values to uncover mechanisms

Electrophilic attack on alkenes by bromine often goes through three-membered ring cyclic
bromonium ions and we can sometimes tell that this is so by studying the stereochemistry.
Here are two reactions of styrenes that look very similar—a reaction with bromine and
another with PhSCl. With no further information, we might be tempted to assume that they
both go by the same mechanism. However, the Hammett ρ values for the two reactions are
rather different.

The ρ value for bromination is defi nitely in the ‘large’ range and can only mean that a positive charge is formed that is delocalized round the benzene ring. Bromine evidently does not
form a bromonium ion with these alkenes but prefers to form a secondary benzylic cation
instead, which can be stabilized more effectively by delocalization.

The sulfenylation, on the other hand, has a moderate negative ρ value. No cation is formed
that is delocalized round the ring, but electrons fl ow out of the ring and we suspect some loss
of conjugation. All this fi ts well with the formation of a three-membered ring intermediate.
From experiments like this we learn that PhSCl is much more likely than bromine to react
stereospecifi cally with alkenes through cyclic cation intermediates.

###### A complete picture of the transition state from Hammett plots

More information can be gained on the mechanism of the reaction if two separate experiments can be carried out with the mechanistic probe inserted at two different sites on the
reagents. If we are studying a reaction between a nucleophile and an electrophile, it may be
possible to make Hammett plots from the variation of substituents on both reagents. The
acylation of amines with acid chlorides is an example.

If we vary the structure of the acid chloride we get a ρ value of +1.2, typical of nucleophilic
attack on the carbonyl group. If we vary the amine we get a ρ value of –3.2, typical of a reaction in which electrons that were conjugated round the ring move away to form a new bond.
Comparing the numbers tells us the rate depends on the nucleophilicity of the amine 100
times more than on the electrophilicity of the acid chloride.

###### Non-linear Hammett plots


**O**


**O**

**Ar** **OH**


The Hammett plot for hydrolysis of the acid chlorides of benzoic acids
in aqueous acetone is very odd indeed. Hammett plots need not be perfectly linear to give useful information, but this one is clearly made up
of two intersecting straight lines. This might look like disaster at fi rst
but, in fact, it tells us something rather important. The right-hand part
of the curve, where the more electron-withdrawing substituents lie, has
a slope of +2.5: just what we should expect for rate-determining attack
of water on the carbonyl group. As we go to less electron-withdrawing
substituents, the rate of the reaction suddenly starts to increase as we
pass the para-chloro compound and the left-hand part of the curve has
a slope of –4.4.
What can this mean? If the reaction becomes faster as we pass the
discontinuity in the curve—and it gets faster whether we go from right
to left or left to right—there must be a change in mechanism. If there is
a choice between two mechanisms, the faster of the two will operate.
Mechanism 1 is the rate-determining nucleophilic attack by water on
the carbonyl group.
The new mechanism goes faster for more electron-donating substituents and has quite a large negative ρ value, suggesting the formation of
a cation in the rate-determining step. This mechanism (mechanism 2)
must surely be the SN1-like preliminary formation of an acylium ion by
loss of chloride ion.

When the Hammett plot bends the other way, so that the rate of the reaction decreases as it

A reaction goes by the fastest possible mechanism but its rate is limited by the slowest of the
steps in that mechanism. An example is the intramolecular Friedel–Crafts alkylation of a
diphenyl derivative where the alkylating agent is a diarylmethanol attached to one of the
benzene rings in the ortho position.

The carbocation intermediate in the Friedel–Crafts reaction (Chapter 21) is rather stable,
being tertiary and benzylic, and the formation of the cation, normally the rate-determining
step, with inevitably a negative ρ value, goes faster and faster as the electron-donating
power of the substituents increases until it is faster than the cyclization, which becomes
the rate-determining step. The cyclization puts electrons back into the carbocation and
has a positive ρ value. As the two steps have more or less the reverse electron fl ow to and
from the same carbon atom, it is reasonable for the size of ρ to be about the same but of
opposite sign.

###### Other kinetic evidence for reaction mechanisms

 The kinetic isotope effect



- You have seen how isotopes
have different physical
properties—their nuclear spin,
for example, which affects how
they behave in an NMR
machine. We also showed you
in Chapter 3 how IR stretching
frequencies depend on mass,
and there you saw that C–D
bonds have lower stretching
frequencies than C–H bonds.
That fact is highly relevant to
the explanation we are about to
give you for the origin of kinetic
isotope effects.


Up to now you have probably (and rightly) assumed that isotopes of an element are chemically identical. They differ only in the number of neutrons in their nuclei: chemistry generally depends on charge, orbitals, and electrons. It may come as a surprise to fi nd that this is
not quite true. Isotopes may differ chemically, because some chemical properties do depend
on atomic mass. However, this difference is only signifi cant for hydrogen—no other element
has one isotope twice as massive as another! _Kinetic isotope effects are the changes in rate_
observed when a ([1]H) hydrogen atom is replaced by a ([2]H) deuterium atom in the same reaction. For any reaction, the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is defi ned as

KIE = _kH_ /kD



- The full explanation of the
theory of kinetic isotope effects
is beyond the scope of this book
but you can read about it in any
book on physical organic
chemistry.


where kH is the rate with a [1]H atom in the molecule and kD is the rate with a [2]H (deuterium, D)
atom in the molecule.
How do kinetic isotope effects come about? Even in its lowest energy state a covalent bond
never stops vibrating. If it did it would violate a fundamental physical principle, Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle, which states that position and momentum cannot be known exactly at
the same time: a non-vibrating pair of atoms have precisely zero momentum and precisely
fi xed locations. The minimum vibrational energy a bond can have is called the zero point
energy, and the zero point energy depends on the mass of the atoms attached to the bond—
heavier atoms have a lower zero point energy than lighter ones.

displacement (distance between C and H or D)

In order to break a covalent bond, a certain amount of energy is required to separate the
nuclei from their starting position. This energy has to raise the vibrational state of the bond
to the point where it breaks. For the sake of argument, imagine taking a C–H bond in its lowest energy state and breaking it—the diagram shows the amount of energy required, which we
can call ΔG[‡]H. Now do the same for a C–D bond: because the zero point energy of a C–D bond
is smaller than that for a C–H bond, the C–D bond needs that little bit more energy ΔG[‡]D to
break: in other words a C–D bond is marginally stronger than a C–H bond. This means reactions in which C–H bonds break go faster than reactions in which C–D bonds break, providing
_the bond to H (or D) is involved in the rate-determining step. The theoretical maximum value of_


-----

the KIE is about 7 for reactions at room temperature in which a bond to H or D is being broken.
For example, the rates of these two eliminations can be compared, and kH/kD turns out to be
7.1 at 25 °C.

**EtO** **EtO**

**Br** rate = k H rate = k D **Br**

**H** **H** **_kH_** **7.1** **H(D)** **D** **D**

**_kD_**

In this case the fact that the KIE is non-zero tells us that the C–H (or C–D) bond is being
broken during the rate-determining step, and so the reaction must be an E2 elimination. In
E1 eliminations, the rate-determining step does not involve a breaking C–H bond.
In Chapter 21 we told you that the rate-determining step in the nitration of benzene was the
attack of the electrophile on the benzene ring. This is easily verifi ed by replacing the hydrogen atoms round the benzene ring with deuteriums. The rate of the reaction stays the same,
so the C–H (or C–D) bonds cannot be involved in the rate-determining step. If the second
step, which does involve the breaking of a C–H bond, were the rate-determining step it would
go more slowly if the H were replaced by D.

By contrast, for the iodination of phenol in basic solution there is a deuterium isotope effect
of kH/kD = 4.1. Clearly, the loss of the proton from the intermediate must now be the ratedetermining step—the phenolate ion reacts so rapidly that the fi rst step is faster than the
second.

The deuterium isotope effect can add to the information from Hammett plots in building
up a picture of a transition state. Three separate Hammett ρ values can be measured for the
elimination reaction and this information is very valuable. In addition, a large KIE kH/kD =
7.1 is observed for the hydrogen atom under attack.

It is no surprise that the base (ArO[−]) donates electrons and the leaving group (ArSO3−) accepts
them, as the ρ values indicate. The large deuterium isotope effect tells us that the reaction is
E2, but additional information comes from the moderate positive ρ(Y) value for the aromatic
ring adjacent to the proton being lost. It might have been expected that this ring is merely
a spectator, but in fact the reaction must involve a build-up of negative charge, which can
be stabilized by an electron-donating substituent Y. This can be explained if we assume


-----

that the removal of the proton is slightly more advanced at the transition state than loss of
the leaving group.

The entropy of activation, ΔS[‡], of a reaction tells us about the increase or decrease in order in
a reaction as the starting material goes to the transition state. A positive ΔS[‡] means an increase
in entropy or a decrease in order, and a negative ΔS[‡] means an increase in order. Normally,
unimolecular reactions in which one molecule gives two products have a positive ΔS[‡] and
bimolecular reactions have a negative ΔS[‡]. Fragmentations (Chapter 36), such as this decarboxylation in which one molecule fragments to three, have positive values of ΔS[‡], in this case
ΔS[‡] = +36.8 J mol[−][1] K[−][1].

All the values in this book are in

(e.u.), which are cal mol[−][1] K[−][1].
Values in e.u. should be
multiplied by 4.18 to get values
in J mol[−][1] K[−][1].


At the other extreme are cycloadditions (Chapter 34) such as the Diels–Alder reaction we
examined a few pages back. Not only do two reagents become one product but a very precise
orientation is required in the transition state, usually meaning a large negative ΔS[‡]. Diels–
Alder reactions usually have ΔS[‡] of about –120 to –160 J mol[−][1] K[−][1]. The classic cyclopentadiene
addition to maleic anhydride has ΔS[‡] = –144 J mol[−][1] K[−][1].

The Hammett ρ value of –4.1 suggests a carbocation intermediate, as does the regioselectivity of the reaction (MeOH attacks the benzylic position) but the stereochemistry (the reaction occurs with inversion) and a modest negative entropy of activation (ΔS[‡] = –48 J mol[−][1] K[−][1])

As you have seen throughout this book, acids and bases provide the most widely used ways of
speeding up reactions. If you want to make an ester—add some acid. If you want to hydrolyse
an ester—add some base. We explained in Chapter 12 the ways in which acid and base catalysts help reactions along, and we introduced you to the terms specifi c acid and specifi c base,
**general acid and** **general base. We will now look in a little more detail at these types of**
catalysis and give some pointers as to how to establish which of them, if any, is operative in
any given reaction.
As a preliminary, let’s look at an example of specifi c acid catalysis. This is the kind operating in the reaction just above—epoxides don’t react with methanol but, if we protonate the
epoxide fi rst, then the reaction works. Specifi c acid catalysis protonates electrophiles and
makes them more electrophilic.

We could, on the other hand, have reasoned that although methanol is not a good enough
nucleophile, deprotonating with a base will make it into the much more nucleophilic methoxide, and the reaction will also work. This sort of base catalysis—deprotonating nucleophiles
to make them more nucleophilic—is specifi c base catalysis.

###### Specifi c acid catalysis

Specifi c acid catalysis (SAC) involves a rapid protonation of the compound followed by the
slow step, which is accelerated in comparison with the uncatalysed reaction because of the
greater reactivity of the protonated compound. You have just seen an example with an epoxide; ester hydrolysis (or formation) is another, as you saw in Chapter 12.

A more interesting reaction is the dienone–phenol rearrangement. Rearrangement in the
absence of acid is very slow but once the ketone oxygen is protonated, it occurs very rapidly.

acid and base catalysis, and an

and general acid/base catalysis
mean, see Chapter 12,

Again we have fast equilibrium protonation, followed by a rate-determining step involving a
reaction of the protonated species: this is SAC.

- As you saw on p. 1050, the
usual kinetic isotope effect has
kH/kD - 1. Reactions with kH/kD
<1 exhibit an inverse kinetic
isotope effect. We don’t need to
go into details of how this might
come about, but this is the
reason a reaction that goes
faster in D2O than in H2O (even
when that is expected) is said to
have an inverse solvent kinetic
isotope effect.


This catalysis depends only on the protonating power of the solution. The compound must
be protonated to react, so the catalyst must be a strong enough acid to do the job. It is not
necessary that every molecule is protonated—just enough to set the reaction going because
the catalytic acid is regenerated at the end. In a specifi c acid catalysed reaction, the rate of the
reaction depends on the pH of the reaction mixture. SAC works only if the pH is similar to, or
below, the pKa of the conjugate acid of the substrate, and the log of the rate of the reaction is
proportional to the pH of the solution.
There is one rather remarkable experimental indication of this mechanism. If the reaction is carried out in a deuterated solvent (D2O instead of H2O) the rate of the reaction
increases. This is a _solvent isotope effect rather than a kinetic isotope effect and needs_
some explanation. If you examine the three examples of SAC in the previous pages you
will see that they share these characteristics: a fast proton exchange is followed by a
rate-determining step that does _not involve the making or breaking of any bonds to_
hydrogen. In general terms:


The rate of the reaction is the rate of the rate-determining step:

rate = k[XH[+]]

The concentration of the intermediate [XH[+]] is related to the pH and to the concentration of
the substrate by the equilibrium constant, K, of the protonation. This gives us:

rate = kK[H[+]][X]

In the acid-catalysed reaction, the bond to H (or D) is not broken in the rate-determining
step, so k cannot change when hydrogen is replaced by deuterium. That means that if a reaction goes faster in D2O than in H2O then it must be K that is different (i.e. larger) in D2O. SAC
is more effective with D3O[+] in D2O than with H3O[+] in H2O because more of the substrate is
protonated at any one time.

- **An inverse solvent isotope effect (k[D2O] > k[H2O]) is indicative of specifi c acid catalysis.**



- It is not, of course, possible
to use D3O[+] in H2O as H and D
exchange very quickly. The
solvent determines which acid is
present.


This is sometimes explained by saying that D3O[+] is a stronger acid than H3O[+]. This is
partly true. The full truth is that D3O[+] _in D2O is a stronger acid than H3O[+]_ _in H2O. Water_
(H2O) is a better solvating agent for H3O[+] than D2O is for D3O[+] because O–H bonds are
longer than O–D bonds. Look again at the potential energy curve we showed you on p. 1050
and reproduced below, this time representing the energies of O–H and O–D bonds. The
average length of a bond is the mid-point of the line in the potential energy well representing its energy level. You can easily see that the mid-point for the O–H is further out than
the mid-point for the O–D bond because of the asymmetry of the well. O–H bonds are
longer than O–D bonds, and can therefore make stronger hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen
bonds are better at allowing solvation of H3O[+], making H3O[+] in H2O less willing to protonate a substrate than D3O[+] in D2O.


-----

Let’s illustrate all this with an example. The Z allylic alcohol below dehydrates in acid
solution to the E diene. We have lots of data on this mechanism, all summarized in the
diagrams. You may like to note as well that the product contains no deuterium after
de hydration in D2O.

The Hammett ρ value of –6.0 suggests a carbocation intermediate and the positive entropy
of activation suggests a rate-determining step in which disorder increases, perhaps one molecule breaking into two. The inverse solvent deuterium isotope effect (faster reaction in D2O
than in H2O) strongly suggests SAC. Putting all this together we have a mechanism—a simple
example of SAC. There is no protonation at carbon.

###### Specifi c base catalysis

The other side of the coin is specifi c base catalysis (SBC). SBC usually involves the removal of a
proton from the substrate in a fast pre-equilibrium step followed by a rate-determining reaction of the anion. Most of the base-catalysed reactions you are familiar with work by SBC.
Examples include opening of epoxides with thiols.

As with SAC, the rate of the reaction depends on the pH of the solution. If it is around or
higher than the pKa of the thiol, thiolate anion will be formed and this opens the epoxide
much faster than does the unionized thiol. The nucleophile is then regenerated by the oxyanion produced in the rate-determining step.
It is quite common for specifi c acid and specifi c base catalysis to operate on the same reaction, depending on the pH at which the reaction is carried out. In fact, you have already seen
this for ester hydrolysis in Chapter 12. The pH–rate profi le (Chapter 12) for the hydrolysis of a
simple ester such as ethyl acetate shows just two straight lines meeting each other (and zero
rate) at about neutrality. Ethyl acetate hydrolysis occurs by SAC or SBC only.

###### Microscopic reversibility

There is only one least-energy
pathway between two interconverting compounds such as the
starting material and the intermediate here. Every microscopic
detail of the back reaction is
exactly the same as that for the
forward reaction. This is the
principle of microscopic reversibility. Here we use evidence
from the back reaction (slow
proton transfer from water to
the carbanion) to tell us about
the forward reaction.


The isotope effect observed is certainly inverse (the reaction is faster with H2O than D2O)
but the magnitude of the effect is too large to be a solvent isotope effect and looks much more
like an inverse kinetic isotope effect. And so it is. The tertiary amine is not a very good leaving
group in spite of its positive charge (pKa of R3NH[+] is about 10) so the carbanion mostly reverts
to starting materials. The isotope effect is a kinetic isotope effect on this reverse step—the
protonation of the carbanion. This reaction involves a proton transfer from H2O or D2O and
will be much faster (7.7 times in fact) in H2O due to an ordinary kinetic isotope effect. The
_elimination reaction goes faster in D2O because the back reaction goes more slowly and more_
of the carbanion goes on to product.

###### General base catalysis

In Chapter 12 (p. 263) we pointed out that even weak bases—too weak to deprotonate a
nucleophile by the mechanism we have just described for SBC—can still act as catalysts.
Such catalysts are known as general base catalysts, and are the promoters of a parallel
kind of acid–base catalysis called ‘general’ rather than ‘specifi c’. General base catalysis,
abbreviated GBC, depends not only on pH (i.e. the concentration of hydroxide ion) but
also on the concentration of other bases too. General acid catalysis, abbreviated GAC,
likewise depends not only on pH (i.e. the concentration of H3O[+]) but also on the concentration of other undissociated acids HA. General acid–base catalysis is a milder kind
of catalysis and is characteristic of reactions catalysed by enzymes in the metabolism of
living things.
In a general base-catalysed reaction, proton transfer is not complete before the ratedetermining step (as it was in SBC) but occurs during the rate-determining step. A simple
example is the catalysis by acetate ion of the formation of esters from alcohols and acetic
anhydride.

How can this catalysis work? At fi rst sight there seems to be no mechanism available.
Acetate cannot act as a specifi c base—it is far too weak (pKa AcOH 4.7) to remove a proton
from an alcohol (pKa about 15). It can’t operate as a nucleophile, as pyridine does (p. 200),
as nucleophilic attack on acetic anhydride would be a non-reaction, simply regenerating
starting materials. The only thing it can do is to remove the proton from the alcohol as the
_reaction occurs._


There was some discussion of
this reaction in Chapter 12.
Chapter 10 refers to the diffi culty
of pinpointing proton transfers in
mechanisms involving the carbonyl
group.

You will see at once that there is a great disadvantage in this mechanism: the rate-determining
step is termolecular—three molecules have to collide. This comes out most clearly in the
entropy of activation, which has an enormous negative value—around ΔS[‡] = –168 J mol[−][1] K[−][1]
for this reaction. For this reason, GBC or GAC reactions are normally effective only if one of
the three molecules is present in large excess—this reaction might be done in ROH as a solvent, for example, so that ROH is always present. We would also expect a normal kinetic isotope effect for ROD compared with ROH as a bond to hydrogen is being formed and broken in
the rate-determining step: it is kH/kD = 2.4 here.
In understanding how this GBC works it is helpful to look at the mechanism without
catalysis.

The acetate catalyst cannot remove a proton from the starting material but it can easily
remove a proton from the intermediate, which has a complete positive charge on the alcohol
oxygen atom. The starting material has a pKa above the pKa of HOAc but the product has a pKa
well below it. Somewhere in the middle of the rate-determining step, the pKa of the ROH proton passes through the pKa of acetic acid and then acetate is a strong enough base to remove
it. The GBC is effectively deprotonating the transition state.

So how do we fi nd GAC or GBC? Well, fi rst we must remove the more powerful ‘specifi c’ style
of catalysis by working at constant pH because SAC or SBC depends on pH alone. If we fi nd that
the rate of the reaction changes with the concentration of a weak base at constant pH, we have
GBC. The formation of three- and fi ve-membered cyclic ethers shows the contrast between
GBC and SBC. The formation of epoxides is straightforward SBC with a simple linear dependence on pH between pH 8 and 12, and no acceleration at constant pH by carbonate (CO32−) ions.
There is an inverse solvent isotope effect and an aryl substituent at the electrophilic carbon
atom gives the small positive ρ value expected for SN2 with an anion.

Formation of tetrahydrofuran (THF) is also faster at higher pH but, by contrast, is additionally accelerated by various bases at constant pH. If anions of phenols (ArO[−]) are used as catalysts, a Hammett ρ value of +0.8 shows that electrons are fl owing away from the aromatic ring.
There is a small normal kinetic isotope effect kH/kD = 1.4. Both SBC and GBC are therefore
operating in this reaction. Here is the mechanism with ArO[−] as GBC.

Why are the two different? The THF is easy to form, the transition state is unstrained, and
only a little help is needed to make the reaction go—GBC will do. The epoxide is very strained
indeed and the starting material needs to be raised in energy before cyclization will occur.
Only the most powerful form of catalysis—SBC—is good enough.

**3** **Effective at neutral pHs even if below the pKa of the substrate.**

**8** **Normal kinetic isotope effect k(H) > k(D).**


###### General acid catalysis

GAC involves transfer of a proton from a weak acid (too weak to protonate the substrate completely) during the rate-determining step. A few examples will demonstrate to you how this
works. They are all examples where GAC occurs because of a modifi cation to a familiar reaction involving SAC.
In the fi rst one, the termolecular problem (i.e. the fact that in GAC and GBC three molecules
have to come together in the transition state) is avoided by making a reaction intramolecular.
Normally, ester formation and hydrolysis are specifi c-acid-catalysed only, but here there is
catalysis by a weak acid: acetic acid. A normal kinetic isotope effect k(HOAc)/k(DOAc) = 2.3
shows that proton transfer occurs in the rate-determining step and there is a large negative
ΔS[‡] = –156 J mol[−][1] K[−][1]. This is GAC of nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group, admittedly in a
rather special molecule.

In Chapter 11 we emphasized the importance of the mechanism for the formation and
hydrolysis of acetals. These are SAC reactions: alcohols are bad leaving groups and usually
need to be fully protonated by strong acids before they will go, even with the help of the lone
pair of another oxygen atom.

If we speed up the slow step by adding to the molecule some feature that stabilizes the
cation intermediate, GAC may be found. One example is the aromatic cation formed in
the hydrolysis of cycloheptatrienone acetals. The normal kinetic isotope effect announces the
appearance of GAC.


Nature often makes use of GAC
and GBC since the catalysts
required are compatible with the
need to work at pH close to
neutral. As in this example,
enzymes manage to reduce the
number of molecules required
for GAC and GBC to operate by
building the catalytic functional
groups into their active sites.

Even adding one extra alkoxy group so that we have an orthoester instead of an acetal is
enough. These compounds show catalysis with a variety of weak acids at not very acidic pH
(5–6). As one OMe group is protonated, two others help in pushing it out, and they both help
to stabilize the intermediate cation. Nature prefers these milder methods of catalysis, as we
will see in Chapter 42.

For another contrast between SAC and GAC we need only refer you back to the two Z/E
isomerizations earlier in the chapter. Isomerization of the diene is GAC—protonation at
carbon is the slow step—and isomerization of the allylic alcohol is SAC. What we didn’t tell
you earlier was that the GAC reaction has a normal kinetic isotope effect of k(H)/k(D) = 2.5
and a negative entropy of activation ΔS[‡] = –36 J mol[−][1] K[−][1]—just what we should expect for a
bimolecular reaction involving rate-determining proton transfer from oxygen to carbon.
Notice that the intermediate cation is the same whichever the route; only the ways of getting
there, including the rate-determining steps, are different.

###### The detection of intermediates

In earlier chapters we revealed how some reactive intermediates can be prepared, usually under
special conditions rather different from those of the reaction under study, as a reassurance that
some of these unlikely looking species can have real existence. Intermediates of this kind
include the carbocation in the SN1 reaction (Chapter 15), the cations and anions in electrophilic (Chapter 21) and nucleophilic (Chapter 22) aromatic substitutions, and the enols and
enolates in various reactions of carbonyl compounds (Chapters 20, 25, and 26). We have also
used labelling in this chapter to show that symmetrical intermediates are probably involved in,
for example, nucleophilic aromatic substitution with a benzyne intermediate (Chapter 22).

We have hedged this evidence around with caution since the fact that an intermediate can
be prepared does not by any means prove that it is involved in a reaction mechanism. In this
section we are going to consider other and better evidence for intermediates and at the same
time revise some of the earlier material.

###### Trapping reactions

A more impressive piece of evidence is the design of a molecule that has built into it a functional
group that could react with the intermediate in a predictable way but could not reasonably react
with other species that might be present. For example, aromatic ethers react with nitrating
agents in the ortho or para positions (Chapter 21). The intermediate has a positive charge delocalized over three of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring. If a nucleophilic group is built into the
structure in the right way, it might trap this intermediate and stop it reacting further.

If we try drawing a mechanism for the formation of this remarkable compound, we discover
that a necessary intermediate is also an intermediate in our preferred mechanism for aromatic
nitration. The amide has trapped the cation we would propose as an intermediate in aromatic

will hydrolyse to the observed enone.

This mechanism explains everything, including the stereochemistry. The NO2+ attacks the
aromatic ring para to the OMe group and on the opposite side to the amide. The amide is now
in the perfect position to capture the cation at the meta position and, because the tether is
short, it must form a cis bridge.
To be convincing, evidence for an intermediate should include:

 - detection of the intermediate in the reaction mixture, perhaps by a trapping reaction

 - a demonstration that the intermediate gives the product when added to the reaction
mixture (this also means that it must be prepared as an at least reasonably stable
compound)

 - kinetic evidence that the rate of formation and rate of disappearance are adequate

 - other suitable evidence of the kind that we have been discussing in this chapter.

A neat intramolecular trap for a benzyne works in this way. A standard benzyne-generating
reaction, the diazotization of an ortho-amino benzoic acid (Chapter 22), gives a zwitterion
that loses nitrogen and CO2 to release the benzyne. A furan tethered to the next ortho position
traps the benzyne in an intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction. The yield is impressive and the
trap is very effi cient.

This reaction cannot really be explained without a benzyne intermediate. This same
method of making benzyne is used on other o-amino benzoic acids and so we deduce that
they presumably create benzynes too.

###### A collection of reactions linked by a common intermediate

Particularly convincing evidence can develop when a number of chemists suggest the same
intermediate for a number of different reactions and show that it is possible to trap the intermediate from one reaction, put it into the others, and get the normal products. We are going
to describe one such set of related reactions. In Chapter 36 we suggested a mechanism for the
Favorskii rearrangement involving a series of remarkable intermediates. Here is an example.

We’ll summarize the evidence on this particular example. If the reaction is run in MeOD
instead of MeOH, the starting material becomes deuterated at the site of enolate formation,
suggesting that this is a fast and reversible step. The entropy of activation for the reaction is
ΔS[‡] = +64 J mol[−][1] K[−][1], suggesting that the slow step is one molecule breaking into two. There is
only one such step—the second, ionization step. If various substituted phenyl groups are
used, the Hammett ρ value is –5. This large negative value also suggests that the ionization is
the slow step as the cation is delocalized into the benzene ring.

There is evidence for the fi rst intermediate—the exchange of deuterium from the solvent. In
fact formation of the enolate can even become the rate-determining step. If we merely add an
extra methyl group to the chloroketone the reaction becomes 220 times faster and the ratedetermining step changes. There is no longer any exchange of deuterium from the solvent
and the Hammett ρ value changes from –5 to +1.4. This small positive value, showing some
modest increase in electron density near the ring, matches typical known ρ values for enolate
formation.

But does the oxyallyl cation go on to give cyclopropanones? In fact, there is good evidence
that the two are in equilibrium. If the same method is used to create the diphenyl oxyallyl

methoxide is needed only to produce the enolate—methanol alone is enough to decompose

Further information comes from another reaction. If a suitable (1,3-di-t-butyl) allene is

But can the same cyclopropanone be an intermediate in the Favorskii reaction? If the
bromoketone is treated with methoxide in methanol, it gives the Favorskii product, but if it is

Other, less stable, cyclopropanones—such as this 2,2-dimethyl compound—can be made
by carbene addition (Chapter 38) to ketenes. This compound did the Favorskii reaction with
methoxide in methanol: the only product came from the expected loss of the less unstable
carbanion. This will, of course, be general acid catalysed by methanol as no free carbanion
can be released into an alcoholic solvent.

Although it is never possible to prove a mechanism, this interlocking network of intermediates, all known to be formed under the reaction conditions, all being trapped in various ways,
and all known to give the products, is very convincing. If any part of the mechanism were not
correct, that would throw doubt on all the other reactions as well.

###### Stereochemistry and mechanism

Although we have left stereochemistry to the last, it is one of the most important tools in
unravelling complex mechanisms. You have already seen how inversion of confi guration is
a vital piece of evidence for an SN2 mechanism (Chapter 15) while retention of confi guration is the best evidence for participation (Chapter 36). You have seen the array of stereochemical evidence for pericyclic mechanisms (Chapters 34 and 35). The chapters devoted to
diastereoselectivity (32 and 33) give many examples where information about the mechanism follows from the stereochemistry. We shall not go over that material again, but summarize the types of evidence with new examples. The fi rst example looks too trivial to
mention.

Although this reaction looks like a simple SN2 displacement by the naphthyloxide anion on the
primary alkyl chloride, there is, in fact, a reasonable alternative—the opening of the epoxide at
the less hindered primary centre followed by closure of the epoxide the other way round. The
electrophile is known as epichlorohydrin and has two reasonable sites for nucleophilic attack.

It looks diffi cult to tell these mechanisms apart since both involve the same kind of reaction. Stereochemistry is the answer. If enantiomerically pure epichlorohydrin is used, the two
mechanisms give different enantiomers of the product. Although each SN2 reaction takes
place at a primary centre and the stereogenic centre remains the same, the products shown in
orange and in brown are obviously enantiomers.

Finding out the mechanism of this process is not idle curiosity as a group of drugs used to
combat high blood pressure and heart disease, such as propranolol, are made from epichlorohydrin and it is essential to know which enantiomer to use to get the right enantiomer of the
drug. In fact, the epoxide is attacked initially, in preference to the chloride.

A more complicated example arises from the strange reactions used to make malic acid from
chloral and ketene. An initial [2 + 2] cycloaddition is followed by acid treatment and then

The mechanism of this reaction also looks straightforward: normal ester hydrolysis followed by hydrolysis of the CCl3 group to CO2H. Caution suggests investigation, particularly
as four-membered lactones sometimes hydrolyse by SN2 displacement at the saturated ester
carbon rather than by attack on the carbonyl group, like the three-membered lactones discussed in Chapter 36 (p. 934). The solution was urgently needed when it was found that enantiomerically pure lactone could be prepared as a single enantiomer. The sequence was repeated
with enantiomerically pure lactone: lactone hydrolysis occurred with retention of confi guration and must be normal ester hydrolysis by attack of water at the carbonyl group. But the
hydrolysis of the CCl3 group surprisingly occurred with inversion of confi guration.

The answer must be a mechanism related to the one we have just seen for epichlorohydrin.
Attack by hydroxide on CCl3 is almost unknown and it is much more likely that intramolecular attack by alkoxide to give an epoxide should occur. The carboxylate anion can then invert
the stereogenic centre by intramolecular SN2 displacement. Notice that the tether ensures
attack at the nearer end of the epoxide. The second four-membered lactone also hydrolyses by
attack at the carbonyl group.

Baldwin’s rules for ring closures
such as these. The unreactivity of

###### The Ritter reaction and the Beckmann fragmentation

Another collection of related intermediates occurs in the Ritter reaction and the Beckmann
fragmentation. The Ritter reaction involves the combination of a tertiary alcohol and a nitrile
in acid solution and the proposed mechanism involves a series of intermediates.

The Beckmann fragmentation also occurs in acid solution on the fragmentation of an oxime
with a tertiary alkyl group anti to the OH of the oxime. The fragmentation step gives the same
cation and the same nitrile together with a molecule of water and these three combine in the
same way to give the same amide. We need evidence that the carbocation and the nitrilium ion
are genuine intermediates and that the same sequence is found in both reactions.

Evidence that the two reactions are intimately related comes from the formation of the
same amide from two different starting materials: a tertiary alcohol and an oxime, both based
on the decalin skeleton. The oxime has its OH group anti to the ring junction to minimize
steric hindrance as oxime formation is under thermodynamic control (Chapter 11).

The experiments also provide stereochemical evidence that a carbocation is an intermediate in both reactions. Both starting materials are cis-decalins but the product is a transdecalin. The carbocation intermediate has no stereochemistry and can react with the nitrile
from either face: since axial attack is preferred the product is the more stable trans-decalin.
Here’s the mechanism for the Beckmann fragmentation:

It is also possible to trap the carbocation in other ways. The Beckmann fragmentation of this
oxime of an aryl seven-membered ring ketone gives a tertiary carbocation that might be
expected to cyclize to give an amide. However, this reaction would give an unfavourable eightmembered ring (see Chapter 32) and does not happen. Instead, the chain twists round the
other way and forms a much more stable six-membered ring by intramolecular Friedel–Crafts
alkylation.

is this Ritter reaction with KCN as the nitrile in acidic solution so that HCN is the reagent. The

- It’s worth pointing out here
that use of cyanides in acid is

Trapping the nitrilium cation is also possible. A famous example is the heterocycle (an oxazine, Chapter 32) produced by intramolecular capture of the nitrilium ion with a hydroxyl
group. Note that the tertiary alcohol reacts to give the cation while the secondary alcohol acts
as the nucleophilic trap.

An important example in which the diastereoisomer produced was critical in determining the
mechanism is the synthesis of _cis-aminoindanol, a part of Merck’s anti-HIV drug Crixivan_
(indinavir). The reaction involves treatment of indene epoxide with acetonitrile (MeCN) in
acidic solution. The product is a cis fused heterocycle. It is easy to see which atoms have come
from the nitrile (green) but the substitution of nitrogen for oxygen at one end of the epoxide has
occurred with retention of confi guration as the cis-epoxide has given the cis product. Clearly,
we have some sort of Ritter reaction and the nitrilium ion has been trapped with an OH group.

What about the regioselectivity? The obvious explanation is that a cation is formed from
the epoxide by a specifi c acid-catalysed ring opening. But why should the nitrile attack the
bottom face of the cation? We should expect it to attack the top face preferentially as the
hydroxyl group partly blocks the bottom face.

A reasonable suggestion is that the nitrile adds reversibly to the cation. Every time it adds to
the top face, it drops off again as the OH group cannot reach round to form the heterocycle.
But every time it adds to the bottom face (which may well be less often), it is quickly captured
by the OH group because 5,5 fused rings are favourable when the ring junction is _cis._
Eventually, all the compound is converted to the heterocycle.

###### Summary of methods for the investigation of mechanism

This brief summary is for guidance only and the fi gures quoted are approximate ranges only.
The full text above should be used for detail. All methods would not be used in one
investigation.

**1.** **Make sure of the structure of the product**

   - Basic structure (Chapters 3, 13, and 18) and stereochemistry (Chapter 31) by
spectroscopic methods.

   - Detail of the fate of individual atoms by labelling with D, [13]C, and [18]O. Double
labelling may help.

   - The stereochemical course of the reaction (enantio- or diastereoselectivity) may be
critical.

**2.** **Kinetic methods**

   - Rate equation gives the composition of main transition state.

   - Deuterium isotope effect: kH   - _kD shows bond to H formed and/or broken in_
transition state. Values of kH/kD of 2–7 typical.

   - Entropy of activation shows increase (ΔS[‡] positive) or decrease (ΔS[‡] negative) in
disorder. Typical values and deductions:

– ΔS[‡] positive (rarely larger than +50 J mol[−][1] K[−][1]): one molecule breaks into two or three

– moderate negative values: no change in number of molecules (one goes to one
etc.) or bimolecular reaction with solvent


-----

– large negative values: two molecules go to one or unimolecular reaction with
ordered transition state (cycloaddition, etc.)

**3.** **Correlation of structure and reactivity**

                     - Replace one group by another of similar size but different electronic demand (CF3
for CH3 or OMe for CH3).

                     - Systematic Hammett σ/ρ correlation with m- and p-substituted benzenes:

– sign of ρ: +ρ indicates electrons fl owing into and –ρ electrons fl owing out of ring
in transition state

                     - magnitude of ρ shows effect on the benzene ring:

– large (around 5), charge on ring (+ρ, anion; –ρ, cation)

– moderate (around 2–4), charge on atom next to ring—may be gain or loss of
conjugation

– small (<1), ring may be distant from scene of action or ρ may be balance of two ρs
of opposite sign.

**4.** **Catalysis**

                     - pH–rate profi le reveals specifi c acid or base catalysis.

                     - Rate variation with [HA] or [B] at constant pH reveals GAC or GBC.

                     - Deuterium isotope effect: normal (kH                      - _kD) shows GA/BC, inverse solvent_
_k(D2O) >_ _k(H2O) shows SA/BC._

                     - GA/BC is termolecular and has large negative entropy of activation.

**5.** **Intermediates**

                     - Independent preparation or, better, isolation from or detection in reaction mixture
helps.

                     - Must show that intermediate gives product under reaction conditions.

                     - Designed trapping experiments often most convincing.

reactions a chemist can expect to use to make molecules. This chapter introduces the concepts of metal–ligand interaction, describes the most important reactions that can occur
while ligands are bound to the metal, and demonstrates the power of organometallic chemistry in synthesis. The effi ciency of transition metal-catalysed reactions means that they are
routinely used in industrial synthesis. It is important that you understand the rules by which
organometallic chemistry works.

###### The 18 electron rule

There is a contradiction in what is required of a metal complex for it to be useful to us. Initially,
it will need to be stable and have a long enough lifetime to enable study and, ideally, storage.
But once it enters the reaction vessel, stability is a disadvantage: instead we want reactivity. Our
ideal catalyst is a complex that is stable in the resting state, but quickly becomes activated in
solution—perhaps by loss of a ligand—so that it can interact with the substrate. Fortunately,
there is a simple guide to the stability of transition metal complexes: the 18 electron rule. If a
complex satisfi es the 18-electron rule it means that the metal at the centre of the complex has
the noble gas confi guration of 18 electrons in the valence shell, and the complex is likely to be
stable. The requirement for 18 electrons comes from the need to fi ll one ‘s’ orbital, fi ve ‘d’ orbitals, and three ‘p’ orbitals with two electrons in each. The 18 electrons we need can come from
those the metal already possesses plus those donated by any coordinating ligands.
The table below gives you the number of valence electrons each metal starts with before it
acquires any ligands. Notice that the ‘new’ group numbers 1–18 give you the answer without
any calculation. The most important are highlighted.

Group IVB (4) VB (5) VIB (6) VIIB (7) VIIIB (8, 9, and 10) 1A (11)

Number of valence 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

3d electrons **Ti** V Cr Mn **Fe** **Co** **Ni** **Cu**

4d electrons Zr Nb Mo Tc **Ru** **Rh** **Pd** **Ag**

5d electrons Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Pt **Au**

Metals to the left-hand side of this list obviously need many more electrons to make up the
magic 18. Chromium, for example, forms stable complexes with a benzene ring, giving it six
electrons, and three molecules of carbon monoxide, giving it two each: 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18.
Palladium is happy with just four triphenylphosphines (Ph3P:) giving it two each:
10 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18.
You may already know from your study of inorganic chemistry that there are exceptions to
the 18-electron rule, particularly among complexes of Ti, Zr, Ni, Pd, and Pt, which can all
form stable 16-electron complexes. The important 16-electron Pd(II) complex with two chlorides and two acetonitriles (MeCN) will feature heavily in this chapter. The so-called platinum metals Ni, Pd, and Pt are extremely important in catalytic processes, as you will see later
on. Their stable 16-electron confi guration results from a high-energy vacant orbital caused by
the complex adopting a square planar geometry.

###### Ligands can be attached in many different ways

Transition metals can have a number of ligands attached to them and each ligand can be
attached in more than one place. This affects the reactivity of the ligand and the metal
because each additional point of attachment means the donation of more electrons. We can
show the number of atoms involved in bonding to the metal by a hapto number η. A simple
Grignard reagent is η[1] (pronounced ‘eta-one’) as the magnesium is attached only to one carbon atom. A metal–alkene complex is η[2] because both carbon atoms of the alkene are equally
involved in bonding to the metal. In these cases the η designation is not very informative as
there are no alternatives, and it is usually omitted.


-----

The bonding in these two complexes is very different. In the fi rst there is a simple σ bond
between the metal and the alkyl group as in a Grignard reagent R–MgBr and this type of
complex is called a σ **complex. In the alkene complex, bonding is to the p orbitals only.**
There are no σ bonds to the metal, which sits in the middle of the π bond in between the two
p orbitals. This type of complex is called a π **complex.**

###### Representing bonds in transition metal complexes

It is diffi cult to know exactly how to draw the bonding in metal complexes and there are often several different acceptable representations. There is no problem when the metal forms a σ bond to atoms such as Cl or C as the simple line
we normally use for covalent bonds means exactly what it says. The problems arise with ligands that form σ bonds by
donating both their electrons, and with π complexes. Everyone writes phosphine–borane complexes with two charges
but we normally draw the same sort of bond between a phosphine and, say, Pd as a simple line with no charges.

You will sometimes see π complexes drawn with simpler dotted lines going to the middle of the π bond, sometimes with
dotted π bonds, and sometimes with bonds (simple or dotted) going to the ends of the old π bond. These are all acceptable as the bonding is complex, as you will see. We might almost say that the ambiguity is helpful: we often don’t know
either the exact nature of the bonding or the number of other ligands in the complex. In the diagrams in this section we
have shown the main bond from metal to ligand as a heavy line in the simplest representation but we also offer alternatives with simple and dotted bonds. Don’t worry about this—things will become clearer as the chapter develops. When
you have to draw the structure of a complex but you don’t know the exact bonding, just draw a line from metal to ligand.

These labels are useful where there is a choice of type of bonding, as with allylic ligands. The
metal can either form a σ bond to a single carbon (hence η[1]), or form a π complex with the p
orbitals of all three carbons of the allyl system—this would be η[3]. If the π complex is made
from an allyl cation, the ligand has two electrons, but it has four if it is made from an allyl
anion. Similarly, a cyclopentadienyl anion can act as a σ ligand (η[1]), an allyl ligand (η[3]), or,
most usually, as a cyclopentadienyl ligand (η[5]). The distinction is very important for electron
counting as these three different situations contribute two, four, or six electrons, respectively,
to the complex.

Neutral ligands can also bond in a variety of ways. Cyclooctatetraene can act as an alkene
(η[2]), a diene (η[4]), a triene (η[6]), or a tetraene (η[8]), and the reactivity of the ligand changes accordingly. These are all π complexes with the metal above or below the black portion of the ring
and with the thick bond to the metal at right angles to the alkene plane.

To determine the number of electrons around the transition metal in a complex the valence
electrons from the metal ion are added to those contributed by all the ligands. The numbers
of electrons donated by various classes of ligands are summarized in the table. Anions such
as halides, cyanide, alkoxide, hydride, and alkyl donate two electrons, as do neutral ligands
with a lone pair such as phosphines, amines, ethers, sulfi des, carbon monoxide, nitriles, and

isonitriles. Unsaturated ligands can contribute as many as eight electrons and can be neutral
or negatively charged. If the overall total is 18, then the complex is likely to be stable. If the
overall total is less than 18 the complex is called coordinatively unsaturated.

###### Electron counting helps to explain the stability of metal complexes

Counting electrons in most complexes is simple using the table of ligand characteristics above
in conjunction with the table on p. 1070. Take tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium(0): each
neutral phosphine donates two electrons, making a total of eight, and palladium still has its
full complement of 10 valence electrons as it is in the zero oxidation state. Overall, the complex has a total of 18 electrons and is a stable complex—in fact too stable: it has to lose a PPh3
ligand before it can enter into reactions.
All of the different classes of ligands listed in the table above can be treated in this way. In
ferrocene, the cyclopentadienyl ligands contribute six electrons each and have a formal negative charge, shown in green, which means that the iron in ferrocene is in the +2 oxidation
state and will have six valence electrons left. The total for the complex is again 18 and ferrocene is an extremely stable complex.
The useful complex (MeCN)2PdCl2 has palladium in the +2 oxidation state because of its
two chlorine atoms and the number of electrons is eight for the Pd(II) oxidation state and
another two each from the four ligands, making 16 in all. This complex does not fulfi l the
18-electron rule and is stable yet reactive.


###### The oxidation state of metals in complexes

As well as the problem of bond drawing, there is a potential problem over oxidation states too. You can either say that
ferrocene is a complex of Fe(II), having two fewer electrons than the normal eight, with two cyclopentadienyl anions
contributing six electrons each, or you can say that it is a complex of Fe(0), having eight electrons, with two cyclopentadienyl ligands each contributing fi ve electrons. The simplest approach is to say that a metal is in the (0) oxidation state
unless it has σ bonds to ligands such as Cl, AcO, or Me that form bonds with shared electrons. Neutral ligands such as
Ph3P that provide two of their own electrons do not affect the oxidation state of the metal.

###### Bonding and reactions in transition metal complexes

The majority of ligands have a lone pair of electrons in a fi lled sp[n] type orbital that can overlap
with a vacant metal ‘dsp’ orbital, derived from the vacant d, p, and s orbitals of the metal, to
form a conventional two-electron two-centre σ bond. Ligands of this type increase the electron density on the central metal atom.

**M** **L** **M** **L**

A bonding interaction is also possible between any fi lled d orbitals on the metal and
vacant ligand orbitals of appropriate symmetry such as π* orbitals. This leads to a reduction
of electron density on the metal and is known as back-bonding. An example would be a
complex with carbon monoxide. Many metals form these complexes and they are known
as metal carbonyls. The ligand (CO) donates the lone pair on carbon into an empty orbital
on the metal while the metal donates electrons into the low-energy π* orbital of CO. Direct
evidence for this back-bonding is an increase in the C–O bond length and a lowering of
the infrared stretching frequency from the population of the π* orbital of the carbonyl.

When an unsaturated ligand such as an alkene approaches the metal sideways to form a π
complex, similar interactions lead to bonding. The fi lled π orbitals of the ligand bond to
empty d orbitals of the metal, while fi lled d orbitals on the metal bond to the empty π* orbitals
of the ligand. The result is a π complex with the metal–alkene bond perpendicular to the
plane of the alkene. The bond has both σ and π character.

Coordination to a metal by any of these bonding methods changes the reactivity of the
ligands dramatically and this is exploited in the organometallic chemistry we will be discussing in the rest of the chapter. You do not need to understand all the bonding properties of
metal complexes but you need to be able to count electrons, to recognize both σ and π complexes, and to realize that complexes show a balance between electron donation and electron
withdrawal by the metal.

###### Oxidative addition inserts metal atoms into single bonds

Potential ligands that do not have a lone pair or fi lled π-type orbital are still able to interact
with transition metal complexes but only by breaking a σ bond. This is the fi rst step in a wide
variety of processes and is described as oxidative addition because the formal oxidation state
of the transition metal is raised by two, for example M(0) to M(II), in the process. This is the
result of having two extra ligands bearing a formal negative charge. You have seen this process
in the formation of Grignard reagents (Chapter 9).

The number of coordinated ligands also increases by two so the starting complex is usually
in low oxidation state (0 or 1; the diagram shows 0) and coordinatively unsaturated, that is,
it has an empty site for a ligand and, say, only 16 electrons, like (MeCN)2PdCl2, whereas the
product is usually coordinatively saturated, that is, it cannot accept another ligand unless it
loses one fi rst.

Oxidative addition occurs for a number of useful neutral species, including molecular
hydrogen, carbon–hydrogen bonds, and silanes as well as polarized bonds or electrophilic
species containing at least one electronegative atom. The resulting species with metal–ligand
bonds allow useful chemical transformations to occur. Important examples include the
oxidative addition of Pd(0) to aryl iodides and the activation of Wilkinson’s catalyst for hydrogenation in solution by oxidative addition to a hydrogen molecule.

###### Reductive elimination removes metal atoms and forms new single bonds

If we want to use organometallic chemistry to make organic compounds other than those
containing metals, we must be able to remove the ligands from the coordination sphere of the
metal at the end of the reaction. Neutral organic species such as alkenes, phosphines, and
carbon monoxide can simply dissociate in the presence of other suitable ligands but those
that are bound to the metal with shared electrons require a more active process. Fortunately,
most reactions that occur around a transition metal are reversible and so the reverse of oxidative addition, known as **reductive elimination, provides a simple route for the release of**
neutral organic products from a complex. Our general reaction shows M(II) going to M(0),
releasing X–Y. These two ligands were separate in the complex but are bound together in the
product. A new X–Y σ bond has been formed.

reductive elimination


-----

The ligands to be eliminated must be cis to one another for reductive elimination to occur.
This is because the process is concerted. Two examples from palladium chemistry make this
point clear. Warming in DMSO causes ethane production from the fi rst palladium complex
because the two methyl groups are _cis in the square planar complex. The more elaborate_
second bisphosphine forces the two methyl groups to be _trans and reductive elimination_
does not occur under the same conditions.

Of course, no one wants to make ethane that way (if at all) but many other pairs of ligands
can be coupled by reductive elimination. Reductive elimination is one of the most important methods for the removal of a transition metal from a reaction sequence, leaving a
neutral organic product. We will see many examples as the chapter develops but here is an
indole synthesis that depends on a reductive elimination at palladium as a last step. In the
starting material, palladium has two σ bonds sharing electrons with C, and is Pd(II). In the
reaction the two C substituents bond together to form the indole ring and a Pd(0) species is
eliminated.

here must carry more than just
the two ligands it is left with
after the reductive elimination,
but the scheme we have here
doesn’t tell us what they are. It’s
quite conventional in such
cases—where we are more
interested in the structure of the
organic product than the
remains of the complex—to
indicate a general metal ligand
‘L’, or ‘Ln’ for an undefi ned number of unknown ligands.

Two ligands can also react together to produce a new complex that still has the composite
ligand attached to the metal, ready for further modifi cation. This process involves migration of one of the ligands from the metal to the other ligand, and insertion of one of the
ligands into the other metal–ligand bond. It is known as migratory insertion. The insertion process is reversible and, as the metal effectively loses a ligand in the process, the
overall insertion may be driven by the addition of extra external ligands (L) to produce a
coordinatively saturated complex. As with reductive elimination, a cis arrangement of the
ligands is required and the migrating group (X) retains its stereochemistry (if it has any)
during the migration.

Wilkinson’s catalyst is used in homogeneous hydrogenation of alkenes. The catalyst is soluble in many organic solvents such as EtOH, chloroform, or some hydrocarbons. The alkene
complexes with the metal and migratory insertion forms an alkyl metal complex by hydrogen
transfer. The next step, reductive elimination, usually follows rapidly to give the alkane and a
complex that adds a hydrogen molecule to regenerate the catalyst.

Migratory insertion is the principal way of building up the chain of an organic ligand before
elimination. The group to be inserted must be unsaturated in order to accommodate the additional bonds and common examples include carbon monoxide, alkenes, and alkynes, producing metal–acyl, metal–alkyl, and metal–alkenyl complexes, respectively. In each case the
insertion is driven by additional external ligands, which may be an increased pressure of
carbon monoxide in the case of carbonylation or simply excess phosphine for alkene and
alkyne insertions. In principle, the chain extension process can be repeated indefi nitely to
produce polymers by Ziegler–Natta polymerization.

An example of the carbonylation process is the reaction of the tetracarbonyl ferrate dianion

[Fe(CO)42[−]] with alkyl halides. This reagent is made by dissolving metal reduction of the
18-electron Fe(0) compound Fe(CO)5. Addition of two electrons would give an unstable
20-electron species but the loss of one of the ligands with its two electrons restores the stable
18-electron structure.

This iron anion is a good soft nucleophile for alkyl halides and can be used twice over to
produce fi rst a monoanion with one alkyl group and then a neutral complex with two alkyl
groups and four CO ligands. Each of these complexes has 18 electrons. If extra CO is added by
increasing the pressure, CO inserts into one Fe–C bond to form an iron acyl complex. Finally,
reductive elimination couples the acyl group to the other alkyl group in a conceptually simple
ketone synthesis. It does not matter which Fe–C bond accepts the CO molecule: the same
unsymmetrical ketone is produced at the end.

Any good two-electron ligand will cause the CO insertion: Ph3P is often used instead of
an increased CO pressure. The phosphine adds to the iron and pushes out the poorest
ligand (one of the alkyl groups) on to a CO ligand in a process of ligand migration. We
can represent this as the mechanism below, although the phosphine addition and alkyl
migration may well be concerted to avoid the formation of a 20-electron complex as an
intermediate.

###### Carbon monoxide incorporation extends the carbon chain

**Carbonylation (the addition of carbon monoxide to organic molecules) is an important**
industrial process as carbon monoxide is a convenient one-carbon feedstock and the resulting
metal–acyl complexes can be converted into aldehydes, acids, and their derivatives. The OXO
**process is the hydroformylation of alkenes such as propene and uses two migratory insertions**
to make higher value aldehydes. Although a mixture is formed, this is acceptable from very
cheap and abundant starting materials. Here the metal complex is a catalyst, not a stoichiometric reagent.

A catalytic cycle (going clockwise from the top) shows the various stages of alkene coordination, hydrometallation (migratory insertion) to produce an alkyl metal species, coordination

cycle. The steps leading to the other regioisomeric aldehyde and the ligands on the metal are

###### Insertion reactions are reversible

The reverse process, decarbonylation, is also fast but can be arrested by maintaining a pressure
of carbon monoxide above the reaction mixture. The reverse of hydrometallation involves the
elimination of a hydride from the adjacent carbon of a metal alkyl to form an alkene complex.


-----

This process is known as β **hydride elimination or simply β** **elimination. It requires a vacant**
site on the metal as the number of ligands increases in the process and so is favoured by the
shortage of ligands in 16-electron complexes. In more complex structures, the metal and the
hydride must be syn to each other on the carbon chain for the elimination to be possible. The
product is an alkene complex that can lose the neutral alkene simply by ligand exchange.
β elimination is an important fi nal step in a number of transition-metal catalysed processes,
but it can be a nuisance because Pd–Et (and other similar Pd–alkyl) complexes cannot be used
as β elimination is too fast.

###### Palladium is the most widely used metal in homogeneous catalysis

These elementary steps form the basis for most of organo-transition metal chemistry, and are
the same regardless of the metal and the detailed structure of the ligands. Transition metal
catalysis is an enormous and rapidly expanding fi eld that we just do not have the space to
discuss in comprehensive detail. Instead, we will concentrate on the chemistry of one important, and representative, transition metal: palladium. Pd-catalysed reactions are widely used
in both industrial and academic laboratories, on both a minute and very large scale. The
variety of reactions that can be catalysed by Pd together with the range of functional groups
tolerated, and usually excellent chemo- and regioselectivity, means that most syntheses of
organic molecules of any complexity will now involve palladium chemistry in one or more
key steps.

###### Choice of palladium complex

There are many available complexes of palladium(0) and palladium(II). Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0),
Pd(PPh3)4, and tris(dibenzylidene-acetone)dipalladium(0), Pd2(dba)3, or the chloroform complex, Pd2(dba)3•CHCl3, which
is air-stable, are the most common sources of palladium(0). The detailed structures of some palladium complexes, particularly the dimers, are beyond the scope of this book but we will discuss the reactions in detail. Palladium(II) complexes are
generally more stable than their palladium(0) counterparts. The dichloride PdCl2 exists as a polymer and is relatively
insoluble in most organic solvents. However, (PhCN)2PdCl2 and (MeCN)2PdCl2 (both easily prepared from PdCl2) are soluble forms of PdCl2, as the nitrile ligands are readily displaced in solution. Bis(phosphine)palladium(II) chloride complexes
are also air-stable and readily prepared from PdCl2. Palladium is, of course, an expensive metal—these complexes cost
about £50–100 per gram—but very little is needed for a catalytic reaction.

Let’s start with a review of the basic chemistry of palladium, as you will be seeing many
more examples of these steps in specialized situations. Palladium chemistry is dominated by
two oxidation states. The lower, palladium(0), present in tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, for example, is nominally electron-rich, and will undergo oxidative addition with suitable substrates such as organic halides, resulting in a palladium(II) complex. Oxidative
addition is thought to occur on the coordinatively unsaturated 14-electron species, formed by
ligand dissociation in solution.

The resulting Pd–R σ bond in such complexes is very reactive, especially towards carbon–carbon π bonds. Thus an alkene in the reacting system will lead to coordination followed by migratory insertion into the palladium–carbon σ bond. Like hydrometallation
this process is a migratory insertion and is called carbopalladation because carbon and
palladium become attached to the ends of the alkene system. There is no change in oxidation state during this process, although the ligands (often phosphines) must dissociate
to allow coordination of the alkene and associate to provide a stable fi nal 16-electron
product.

With some metals the process of olefi n coordination and insertion may continue, leading
to polymerization, but with palladium the metal is expelled from the molecule by a β-hydride
elimination reaction and the product is an alkene, plus a Pd(II) complex. For the whole process to be catalytic, this Pd(II) product of β-hydride elimination must be converted to a Pd(0).
This occurs in the presence of base, which removes HX from the palladium(II) species. This is
another example of reductive elimination: one that forms a hydrogen halide rather than a
carbon–carbon or carbon–hydrogen bond, as you saw earlier.

The speed of the β-hydride elimination (which is intramolecular and very fast) means that
the original substrate for the oxidative addition reaction must be chosen with care—the presence of hydrogen at an sp[3] carbon in the β position must be avoided. Thus, substrates for
oxidative addition reactions in palladium chemistry are frequently vinylic, allylic, or aromatic and never ethyl or n-propyl.

###### The Heck reaction couples together an organic halide or trifl ate and an alkene

All the individual steps outlined above combine to make up the catalytic pathway in the
**Heck reaction with which we started the chapter. The Heck reaction couples an alkene with**
an organic halide or trifl ate R[1]–X to form a new alkene. The R[1] group in R[1]–X can be aryl,
vinyl, or any alkyl group without β hydrogens on an sp[3] carbon atom. The group X can be a
halogen (Br or I) or trifl ate (OSO2CF3). The alkene can be mono- or disubstituted and can be
electron-rich, -poor, or -neutral. The base need not be at all strong and can be Et3N, NaOAc, or
aqueous Na2CO3. The reaction is very accommodating!

This palladium-catalysed addition of aryl,

The method is very effi cient, and carries out a
transformation that is diffi cult by more traditional techniques. The mechanism involves
the oxidative addition of the halide, insertion
of the olefi n, and elimination of the product
by a β-hydride elimination process. A base
then regenerates the palladium(0) catalyst.
The whole process is a catalytic cycle.
Here is the Heck reaction at work coupling
two heterocyclic substrates. Easy chemistry
to do, but impossible without a Pd catalyst.

Notice the regioselectivity: unlike the carbonylation on p. 1077, the Heck reaction favours
one isomer, and when the alkene is polarized by an electron-withdrawing group the new
C–C bond forms at the other end of the alkene. Notice also in this example and those below
that the Pd is added as Pd(II), not Pd(0): the box below explains how this works.
The mild conditions of the Heck reaction mean that protected amino acids can be
made without any racemization. The two examples below use a more hindered analogue of
triphenyl phosphine, but the mechanism is the same.

###### In situ formation of Pd(0) by reduction of Pd(II)

In reactions requiring palladium(0), formation of the active complex may be achieved more conveniently by reduction
of a palladium(II) complex, for example Pd(OAc)2. Any phosphine may then be used in the reaction, without the need
to synthesize and isolate the corresponding palladium(0)–phosphine complex. The reduction of palladium(II) to palladium(0) can be achieved with amines, phosphines, alkenes, and organometallics such as DIBAL-H, butyllithium,
or trialkylaluminium. The mechanisms are worth surveying as they illustrate the basic steps of organometallic
chemistry.


-----

In contrast, electron-donating groups such as ethers lead to attack at the end of the alkene
substituted by oxygen to produce the 1,1-disubstituted product. These reactions must be dominated by the interaction of the fi lled π orbital of the alkene with an empty d orbital on Pd.
In the example below, the Heck reaction works even in the absence of a phosphine ligand.

Because β-hydride elimination is reversible, when there is a choice the more stable of the
possible alkenes usually results. The reaction of allylic alcohols is particularly important as
the more stable of the two alkenes is the enol and a carbonyl compound is formed.

###### Hydropalladation–dehydropalladation can lead to alkene isomerization

Reversible β-hydride eliminations provide a mechanism for interconverting regioisomers of an
alkene, and the following reaction sequence also illustrates another point about the reductive
elimination step: it is a syn elimination, and the C–Pd and C–H bonds have to eclipse one
another for the Pd–H bond to form. Oxidative addition of the aryl iodide to a palladium(0)
complex, formed from Pd(OAc)2 by reduction, gives the active palladium(II) complex
ArPdOAcL2. Carbopalladation occurs as expected on an electron-rich alkene to give the product of aryl addition to the oxygen end of the alkene in a syn fashion. β-Hydride elimination
must occur away from the aryl group because there is only one C–H bond syn to the C–Pd
bond. The alkene has moved one position round the ring.

The initial mechanism is much the same. However, the enol ether has two diastereotopic
faces: syn or anti to the aromatic substituent (Ar[1]) introduced in the fi rst step. Palladium is
very sensitive to steric effects and generally forms less hindered complexes where possible, so
the palladium(II) complexes the face of the enol ether anti to Ar[1]. This in turn controls all the
subsequent steps, which must be syn, leading to a fi nal product with anti stereochemistry.
The requirement for syn β-hydride elimination also explains the regiochemical preference of
the elimination. In the σ-bonded cyclic structure there is only one hydrogen (green) that is
_syn to the palladium; the one on the carbon bearing the naphthyl substituent is anti and can-_
not be eliminated. Further migrations of the alkene by hydropalladation are prevented by
the silver carbonate, which rapidly removes iodide from the intermediate, preventing readdition of Pd–H to the alkene.

###### Cross-coupling of organometallics and halides

Other than β-hydride elimination, another important pathway by which palladium(II) intermediates can lead to neutral organic fragments is reductive elimination. This forms the basis
of the mechanism for cross-coupling reactions between an organometallic reagent and an
organic halide or trifl ate.

This is a reaction that seems very attractive for synthesis but, in the absence of a transition
metal catalyst, the yields are very low. We showed in Chapter 27 how vinyl silanes can be
made with control over stereochemistry and converted into lithium derivatives with retention. Neither of these vinyl metals couple with vinyl halides alone. But in the presence of a
transition metal—Cu(I) for Li and Pd(0) for Sn—coupling occurs stereospecifi cally and in
good yield.

The mechanism of palladium-catalysed cross-coupling starts, as in the Heck reaction,
with oxidative addition of the halide or trifl ate to the initial palladium(0) phosphine complex to form a palladium(II) species. But the next step is new: it is a transmetallation, socalled because the nucleophile (R[1]) is transferred from the metal in the organometallic
reagent to the palladium and the counterion (X=halide or trifl ate) moves in the opposite
direction. The new palladium(II) complex with two organic ligands undergoes reductive
elimination to give the coupled product and the palladium(0) catalyst, ready for another
cycle.

The reaction is important because it allows the coupling of two different components (R[1]
and R[2]), distinguished by being bonded either to the metal M or to the halide or trifl ate X.
Both components form σ complexes with Pd but the halide partner (R[2]X) bonds fi rst by oxidative addition and this R[2]–Pd bond must survive while the metal partner (R[1]M) transfers R[1] to
Pd by transmetallation. Once the two components are joined to the palladium atom, only the
cross-coupled product can be formed. R[2]X combines with Pd(0) and R[1]M with Pd(II). There
can then be no confusion. In contrast to the Heck reaction, here the metal defi nes the location
of the new C–Pd bond.



- There is a problem in naming
the two partners. The halide
partner (R[2]X) is sometimes
called the electrophile and the
organometallic partner (R[1]M)
the nucleophile. These names
describe the nature of the
reagents rather than the
mechanism of the reaction and
we will not use them.

The halide partner (R[2]X) must be chosen with care, as β-hydride elimination would
decompose the fi rst intermediate during the slow transmetallation step. The choice for R[2] is
restricted to substituents without β-hydrogen atoms on sp[3] carbon atoms: vinyl, allyl, benzyl, and polyfl uoroalkyl halides, trifl ates, and phosphates have all been coupled successfully. The organometallic reagent (R[1]M) can be based on magnesium, zinc, copper, tin,
silicon, zirconium, aluminium, or boron and the organic fragment can have a wide variety
of structures as coupling is faster than β-hydride elimination.

The difference in relative reactivity of aromatic iodides and trifl ates was exploited in this
sequential synthesis of substituted terphenyls by repeated coupling with organozinc reagents. The more reactive iodide coupled at room temperature with palladium(0) and trifurylphosphine but warming to 65 °C was required for the trifl ate to participate in the second
coupling.

###### Nobels

Organometallic chemistry has
been a popular subject for the
Nobel prize committee. In 1912
Grignard (Mg) won the award,
in 1973 Wilkinson and Fischer
for ‘sandwich’ compounds (such
as ferrocene), in 2005 Chauvin,
Grubbs, and Schrock for alkene
metathesis, and in 2010 Heck,
Negishi, and Suzuki (Stille had
died in 1989) for transitionmetal catalysed couplings.



- In the reactions of trifl ates, a
source of halide (typically LiCl) is
generally required since trifl ate
is a counterion and may not
bind to the metal as a ligand:
chloride can take its place.


In spite of the wide range of organometallic reagents that can be used there are two classes
that have proved particularly popular because they are stable intermediates in their own right
and can be prepared and purifi ed separately before the coupling reaction. These crosscouplings are known by the names of the two chemists whose work made the reactions so
valuable. The Stille coupling employs a stannane as the organometallic component (R[1]M)
while the Suzuki coupling relies on a boronic acid.

###### The Stille coupling uses stannanes as the organometallic component

Since its discovery in the late 1970s, the Stille coupling has been widely used for the coupling
of both aromatic and vinylic systems.

The mechanism involves the oxidative addition of the vinyl or aromatic trifl ate or halide to
give an organopalladium intermediate. Transmetallation with the organostannane forms
another organopalladium intermediate with two Pd–C σ bonds. A reductive elimination step
releases the product and thereby regenerates the palladium(0) catalyst. Vinyl trifl ates can be
made from enolizable aldehydes or ketones and aryl trifl ates from phenols, but the reaction
also works with vinyl and aryl halides.

Simply performing a normal Stille reaction in the presence of carbon monoxide may also

The mechanism follows that of a normal Stille coupling except that the carbon monoxide
fi rst exchanges for one of the phosphine ligands and then very rapidly inserts to produce an
acyl palladium(II) complex. Transmetallation with the vinyl stannane in the usual way forms
trimethylstannyl iodide and the key palladium complex carrying two carbon ligands.
Transmetallation is always the slow step in these coupling reactions, allowing time for the
carbon monoxide insertion. The fi nal step—reductive elimination—releases the Pd(0) catalyst for the next cycle.

###### The Suzuki coupling couples boronic acids to halides

The Suzuki coupling of a boronic acid or ester with a vinyl or aryl halide or trifl ate is probably
the most commonly used of all cross-coupling reactions. The original version, fi rst reported
in 1979, involved hydroboration of an alkyne with catecholborane, followed by palladium(0)catalysed coupling of the resulting vinyl boronate with an aromatic iodide or bromide. The
hydroboration is generally regioselective for the less hindered position and addition of boron
and hydrogen occurs cis stereospecifi cally.

Some methods for the
synthesis of alkenes with control of
double bond geometry were
covered in Chapter 27.


As in the Stille coupling, the geometry of both unsaturated components is preserved during
the coupling so this is an excellent method for the stereoselective synthesis of dienes.
Hydroboration of octyne followed by hydrolysis of the boronate gave exclusively the E-vinyl
boronic acid. Coupling with the Z-vinyl bromide in toluene with palladium(0) catalysis with
potassium hydroxide as the base gave the E,Z-diene in good yield. These dienes are very useful
in the Diels–Alder reaction (Chapter 34).

This sort of reaction has been used in the synthesis of the unsaturated units of a range of

The mechanism of the Suzuki coupling is very similar to that of the Stille coupling. Oxidative
addition of the vinylic or aromatic halide to the palladium(0) complex generates a palladium(II)
intermediate. This then undergoes a transmetallation with the alkenyl boronate, from which
the product is expelled by reductive elimination, regenerating the palladium(0) catalyst. The
important difference is the transmetallation step, which explains the need for an additional
base, usually sodium or potassium ethoxide or hydroxide, in the Suzuki coupling. The base
accelerates the transmetallation step, leading to the borate directly, presumably via a more
nucleophilic ‘ate’ complex.

elements to ensure cross-coupling and prevent dimerization.

###### Coupling to alkynes: the Sonogashira reaction

The coupling of terminal alkynes with aryl or vinyl halides under palladium catalysis is
known as the Sonogashira reaction and is rather like the Heck reaction. It is a catalytic process, requiring a palladium(0) complex; it is performed in the presence of base, and generally
uses copper iodide as a co-catalyst. One partner—the aryl or vinyl halide—is the same as in
the Stille and Suzuki couplings but the alkyne needs no metal to activate it: the reaction works
with the alkyne itself.

The mild conditions usually employed, frequently room temperature, mean that the reaction can be used with thermally sensitive substrates. By now, you should not be surprised by
the mechanism! Oxidative addition of the organic halide gives a palladium(II) intermediate
that undergoes transmetallation with the alkynyl copper (generated from the terminal
alkyne, base, and copper iodide). Reductive elimination with coupling of the two organic
ligands gives the product and regenerates the palladium(0) catalyst.

It is usually more convenient, as in the Heck reaction, to use a stable and soluble Pd(II)
derivative such as bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride instead of Pd(0). This is rapidly reduced _in situ to give a coordinatively unsaturated, catalytically active, palladium(0)_
species. The geometry of the alkene is generally preserved so that cis (Z) and trans (E) dichloroethylene give the two different geometrical isomers of the enyne below in >99% stereochemical purity as well as excellent yield.

###### Allylic electrophiles are activated by palladium(0)

Allylic compounds with good leaving groups, such as bromide and iodide, are excellent
allylating agents but they suffer from loss of regiochemistry due to competition between the
direct SN2 and SN2′ reactions. This problem was described in Chapter 24. In contrast, π-allyl

In addition, leaving groups (X) that are usually regarded as rather unreactive still work,
which makes the purifi cation and handling of the starting materials easier. Acetate (X=OAc)
is the most commonly used leaving group, but a range of other functional groups (X=OCO2R,
OPO(OR)2, Cl, Br, OPh) will perform a similar role. The full catalytic cycle is shown below,
with the intermediate π-allyl complex in equilibrium between the neutral version, which has

Soft nucleophiles generally give the best results: stabilized enolates such as malonates, or
cyanide, are best for carbon–carbon bond formation, but for C–X (X=O, N, S) bond formation
the reaction is successful with alkoxides, amines, and thiolates (RS[−]). In the example below an
amine nucleophile attacks the allyl system to generate the more stable product with the double bond within the ring.

The reaction usually proceeds with retention of confi guration at the reacting centre. As in
SN2 substitution reactions going with retention (Chapter 36), this actually suggests a double
inversion. Coordination of Pd to the double bond of the allylic acetate occurs on the less
hindered face opposite the leaving group and we can think of the oxidative addition step as
an invertive nucleophilic displacement of the leaving group by a pair of Pd electrons. The
nucleophile then adds to the face of the π-allyl Pd cation complex opposite the Pd. The net
result is displacement of the leaving group by the nucleophile with retention. Thereafter, the

mechanisms, but it is worth

help us to do this.

###### Vinyl epoxides provide their own alkoxide base

Vinyl epoxides and allylic carbonates are especially useful electrophiles because under the
infl uence of palladium(0) they generate an alkoxide base, so no added base is required with
these substrates. The overall reaction proceeds under almost neutral conditions—ideal with
complex and sensitive substrates. The relief of strain in the three-membered ring drives the
reaction with palladium(0) to produce the zwitterionic intermediate. Proton transfer activates
the nucleophile, and attack at the less hindered end of the π-allyl palladium intermediate
preferentially leads to overall 1,4-addition of NuH.

Retention of stereochemistry is demonstrated by the reaction of a substituted malonate with

forced to add from the same side as the OH group. This, no doubt, helps 1,4-regioselectivity.

Allylic carbonates produce the required alkoxide by decarboxylation of the carbonate anion

product, regenerating the palladium(0) catalyst.

Trost and his group have used both of these palladium-catalysed alkylations in a synthesis
of aristeromycin from epoxycyclopentadiene. The _cis stereochemistry of this carbocyclic_
nucleotide analogue is of paramount importance and was completely controlled by retention
of confi guration in both substitutions.
The fi rst reaction is between epoxycyclopentadiene and adenine, one of the heterocyclic
building blocks of nucleic acids, and follows the mechanism we have just described to give a
_cis-1,4-disubstituted cyclopentene._

###### Intramolecular alkylations make rings

π-Allyl intermediates may also be used in cyclization reactions, including the synthesis of
small and medium-sized rings using an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement. Threemembered rings form surprisingly easily, taking advantage of the fact that the leaving group
can be remote from the nucleophile. The precursors can also be prepared by allylic alkylation.
The sodium salts of malonate esters react with this monoacetate under palladium catalysis at

###### Palladium can catalyse cycloaddition reactions

The presence of fi ve-membered rings such as cyclopentanes, cyclopentenes, and dihydrofurans in a wide range of target molecules has led to a variety of methods for their preparation. One of the most successful of these is the use of trimethylenemethane [3 + 2]
cycloaddition, catalysed by palladium(0) complexes. The trimethylenemethane unit in
these reactions is derived from 2-[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]-2-propen-1-yl acetate, which is at
the same time an allyl silane and an allylic acetate. This makes it both a weak nucleophile
and an electrophile in the presence of palladium(0). Formation of the palladium π-allyl
complex is followed by removal of the trimethylsilyl group by nucleophilic attack of the

The normal way to do the cycloadditions is to react the complex with an alkene bearing

###### Palladium-catalysed amination of aromatic rings

You’ve seen that palladium catalysis helps form carbon–carbon bonds that are diffi cult to
make using conventional reactions. It can also help form carbon–heteroatom bonds that are
diffi cult to make, and you have already seen some examples in the reactions of π-allyl complexes. Work starting in the 1990s by Buchwald and Hartwig has shown that Pd can be used
to promote nucleophilic substitution at a vinylic or aromatic centre—a reaction which would
not normally be possible. For example, aromatic amines can be prepared directly from the
corresponding bromides, iodides, or trifl ates and the required amine in the presence of palladium(0) and a strong alkoxide base.

The mechanisms and catalysts used in this ‘Buchwald–Hartwig’ chemistry mirror those of
coupling reactions involving oxidative addition, transmetallation, and reductive elimination. The fi rst step, as usual, is oxidative insertion of Pd(0) into the aryl–halogen bond. The
Pd(II) complex now adds the amine so that both coupling partners fi nd themselves bonded to
the same palladium atom. The base eliminates H–I from the complex and reductive elimination forms the Ar–N bond.

It is tempting to view the amine as the ‘nucleophile’ in these reactions but it is clear that
nucleophilicity has little to do with it as amides also couple to aromatic rings under similar
conditions. The ability to act as a ligand for palladium is the important thing. The ligand
xantphos (see above) is used in these reactions and again the nature of the substituents on the
benzene ring is of little account. Even strained azetidines react well.

These reactions have been very widely used in the pharmaceutical industry in the making
of medicinal compounds. When Sepracor wanted to make their anti-fungal compound itraconazole, it was obvious that they should make the two ends with stereochemistry and join
them together with a central achiral section. Right in the middle is a piperazine ring joined to
two different benzene rings, one connected through O and one through N. The C–N coupling
chemistry of Buchwald and Hartwig could have been made for this problem.

nitrogen atom by reductive amination with benzaldehyde. The remaining NH group can then
be coupled to the aromatic ring and the benzyl group removed by hydrogenation.

###### Nucleophilic aromatic substitution and palladium catalysis compared

You will have noticed that Buchwald–Hartwig chemistry accomplishes the same as nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr, Chapter 22): the replacement of a halogen by a nucleophile. So what are the differences?

SNAr Buchwald–Hartwig

the leaving group F > Cl > Br > I I > Br > Cl >> F
fl uoride is not the best leaving group but iodide is best at the oxidative addition step but
it accelerates the addition chloride will do and aryl chlorides are cheaper

regiochemistry there must be an electron-withdrawing any substitution pattern acceptable
group ortho or para to the halide

The synthesis of a drug to control blood clotting gives us the opportunity to review both
methods. This compound also has a central piperazine ring and disconnection of the righthand side chain reveals an amine that could be functionalized by alkylation with a suitable
benzylic halide or reductive amination.

A standard way to make aromatic amines is by nitration and reduction (Chapter 21) so we
can think of making this aminobenzene from the nitrobenzene below. Now we can disconnect the two C–N bonds with the idea of putting a halide (X) at the point of substitution in
each aromatic coupling partner.

The substituents on the right-hand ring are both electron withdrawing and are ortho and
_para to the leaving group. As you know from Chapter 22, this is perfect for ordinary nucleo-_
philic aromatic substitution—so much so that chloride is a good enough choice and it is not
necessary to use fl uoride. The left-hand ring has again a good electron-withdrawing substituent but it is _meta to the halide and so nucleophilic aromatic substitution will not work._
Palladium catalysis is needed. Chemists at Berlex Biosciences chose to introduce the left-hand
ring fi rst.

- This regioselectivity is not
the same as in the Heck
reaction, where attack mostly
occurs at the end of the alkene.
Internal nucleophiles transferred
from the palladium to the
alkene usually prefer the
terminal position of the alkene
but external nucleophiles usually
prefer the more substituted end.


###### Alkenes coordinated to palladium(II) are attacked by nucleophiles

Now for another case where a transition metal catalysis facilitates a reaction that would not
occur under normal conditions: nucleophilic attack on an isolated double bond. Usually alkenes react with nucleophiles only when conjugated with an electron-withdrawing group. But
coordination of an electron-rich alkene to a transition metal ion such as palladium(II) changes
its reactivity dramatically: electron density is drawn towards the metal and away from the
π orbitals of the alkene. This leads to activation towards attack by nucleophiles, just as in conjugate addition, and unusual chemistry follows. Unusual, that is, for the alkene; the palladium centre behaves exactly as expected.

**R** **H** **R** **Nu**

+ **Nu** **H** + **PdCl2** + **2HCl** + **Pd(0)**

Many nucleophiles, such as water, alcohols, and carboxylates, are compatible with an alkene–Pd(II) complex and can attack the complexed alkene from the side opposite the palladium. The attack of the nucleophile is regioselective for the more substituted position. This
parallels attack on bromonium ions but is probably governed by the need for the bulky palladium to be in the less hindered position.

The resulting Pd(II) σ-alkyl species decomposes by β-hydride elimination to reveal the substituted alkene. Reductive elimination of a proton and the leaving group, usually chloride,
leads to palladium(0). The weakness of this reaction is that the catalytic cycle is not complete:
Pd(II), not Pd(0), is needed to complex the next alkene.

There are two solutions to this problem. We could use stoichiometric Pd(II) but this is
acceptable only if the product is very valuable or the reaction is performed on a small scale. It
is better to use an external oxidant to return the palladium to the Pd(II) oxidation state so that
the cycle can continue. Air alone does not react fast enough (even though Pd(0) must be protected from air to avoid oxidation) but, in combination with copper(II) chloride, oxygen completes the catalytic cycle. CuCl2 oxidizes Pd(0) to Pd(II) and is itself oxidized back to Cu(II) by
oxygen, ready to oxidize more palladium.

###### Oxypalladation and the Wacker oxidation

This combination of reagents has been used to oxidize terminal vinyl groups to methyl
ketones and is known as the **Wacker oxidation. The nucleophile is simply water, which**
attacks the activated alkene at the more substituted end in an oxypalladation step. β-Hydride
elimination from the resulting σ-alkyl palladium complex releases the enol, which is rapidly
converted into the more stable keto form. Overall, the reaction is a hydration of a terminal
alkene that can tolerate a range of functional groups.

A related reaction is the oxidation of silyl enol ethers to enones. This requires stoichiometric
palladium(II), although reoxidation of Pd(0) with benzoquinone can cut that down to about
half an equivalent. The reaction provides a valuable way of turning regioselective methods for
making silyl enol ethers (Chapter 20) into regioselective methods for oxidizing ketones to
enones. The fi rst step is again oxypalladation and β elimination puts the alkene in conjugation with the ketone: there are no β hydrogens on the other side.

An example of catalytic oxypalladation is the rearrangement of allylic acetates with Pd(II).
The reaction starts with oxypalladation of the alkene and it is the acetate already present in
the molecule that provides the nucleophile to attack the alkene. The intermediate can reverse
the oxypalladation in either direction and the product is whichever allylic acetate has the
more substituted alkene. In this case, trisubstituted beats monosubstituted easily.

###### Alcohols and amines as intramolecular nucleophiles

Cyclic ethers and amines can be formed with an intramolecular alcohol or amine nucleophile. Stoichiometric palladium can be avoided by using benzoquinone as the stoichiometric
oxidant with a catalytic amount of palladium. In this example intramolecular oxypalladation
of a diene is followed by attack of an external nucleophile on a π-allyl complex.

Palladium coordinates to one face of the diene, promoting intramolecular attack by the
alcohol on the opposite face. The resulting π-allyl palladium can form a π-allyl complex with
the palladium on the lower face simply by sliding along to interact with the double bond.
Nucleophilic attack of chloride from the lithium salt then proceeds in the usual way on the
face opposite palladium. The overall addition to the diene is therefore cis.

Nitrogen nucleophiles also attack alkenes activated by Pd(II), and benzoquinone can again
act as a reoxidant, allowing the use of catalytic quantities of palladium. The mechanism follows the same pattern as for oxygen nucleophiles, and a fi nal isomerization produces the most
stable regioisomer of product. In this example the product is an aromatic indole, so the double

###### Palladium catalysis in the total synthesis of a natural alkaloid

We take our leave of palladium by presenting a synthesis of an alkaloid, N-acetyl clavicipitic
acid methyl ester, by Hegedus. The power of organometallic chemistry is illustrated in fi ve of
the steps in this seven-step process (the metals are highlighted in orange). Each of the organometallic steps catalysed by Pd(0) or Pd(II) has been described in this chapter. The overall yield
is 18%, a remarkably good result for a molecule of such complexity.
The fi rst step is to make an indole by Pd(II)-catalysed cyclization in the presence of benzoquinone as reoxidant. The nucleophilic nature of the 3-position of the indole (Chapter 30)
was exploited to introduce the required iodide functionality. Rather than direct iodination,
a high-yielding two-step procedure involving mercuration followed by iodination was
employed.

Aryl iodides are more reactive towards oxidative addition than aryl bromides, and a selective Heck coupling (without phosphine ligands) with an unsaturated side chain left the bromide in place. A second Heck reaction of this bromide with an allylic alcohol was used to
introduce a second side chain. Cyclization of the amide on to the allylic alcohol was achieved
with palladium catalysis, not as might have been expected with palladium(0) but instead with
palladium(II), to produce the seven-membered ring. Finally, the conjugated double bond was
reduced and the sulfonamide removed under photolytic conditions.

###### An overview of some other transition metals

Some metals—palladium chief among them—see continual service in catalysis but others
have their day and then fall out of favour when better alternatives become available. Tin
is less popular now than it was 20 years ago because of its toxicity. A more serious case is
mercury. Mercury(II) is an excellent catalyst for the addition of water to alkynes. But mercury is very toxic indeed, and the last ten years have seen its role largely superseded by
gold. Do not recoil at the expense! Gold is expensive on the scale used to make rings,
plates, medals, and coins, but here it is used in only catalytic quantities. Gold is in fact less
expensive than palladium, rhodium, or ruthenium. Part of the age-old appeal of gold is its
unreactivity as a metal: it is very stable but it does form Au(I) and Au(III) salts such as AuCl
and AuCl3. Both are available commercially and are generally used as their phosphine
complexes.

###### Gold: activating alkynes

Au(I) and Au(III) form cationic π complexes with alkynes and these react with nucleophiles of
many kinds. With water the result is simple: it adds to the more substituted end of the alkyne
and the net result is hydration to give a ketone.

###### Ruthenium: alkene (olefi n) metathesis

The theme of this chapter is that transition metals let you do things to organic molecules
which are unthinkable without them. Nowhere is this more true than in metathesis reactions,
and we fi nish the chapter with a reminder of the power of the ruthenium catalysts we introduced in Chapter 38. There we discussed the carbene-based mechanism of the reaction, and
we showed you some simple examples such as this cyclization of a symmetrical amine to give
a fi ve-membered heterocycle using a catalytic amount of the ruthenium complex known as
Grubbs I catalyst.

The synthesis of a sleep-inducing drug by GlaxoSmithKline in their laboratories at Verona
used a very similar metathesis, although on an unsymmetrical amine and giving a six-membered heterocycle. The starting material is also a single enantiomer and the stereochemistry
is important as the cyclopropane, introduced by a Simmons–Smith reaction (Chapter 38),
must be on the opposite face of the six-membered ring to the side chain.

At another GlaxoSmithKline site, in the USA, the development of a drug for osteoporosis
and osteoarthritis required a seven-membered heterocycle with two controlled chiral centres.
This time the Hoveyda–Grubbs catalyst had to be used but the loading is very low indeed.

Our third example comes from Syngenta’s crop protection laboratory in Basel. It is another
cyclization but this time to form an oxygen heterocycle with four chiral centres. The fi nal
product of this synthesis is malayamycin A, a natural fungicide found in bacteria. The metathesis step is early in the synthesis and you will notice that the alkene formed in this cyclization is used to provide two more chiral centres in malayamycin.

- This chapter builds on the
concepts introduced in Chapter
14: make sure you understand
all the terms used to describe
stereochemistry that are defi ned
there. In particular make sure
you are absolutely clear on the
meanings of chiral, achiral,

‘How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they’d give you milk in
there? Perhaps looking-glass milk isn’t good to drink...’ Lewis Carroll, Through the looking-glass
_and what Alice found there, Macmillan, 1872._
You are chiral, and so are Alice, Kitty, and all living organisms. You may think you look
fairly symmetrical in a looking-glass, but as you read this book you are probably turning the
pages with your right hand and processing the information with the left side of your brain.
Some organisms are rather more obviously chiral: snails, for example, carry shells that could
spiral to the left or to the right. Not only is nature chiral, but by and large it exists as just one
enantiomer—although some snail shells spiral to the left, the vast majority of marine snail
shells spiral to the right; humans have their stomach on their left and their liver on their
right; honeysuckle (Lonicera) climbs by spiralling to the left and all bindweed (Convolvulus)
spirals to the right.
Nature has a left and a right, and it can tell the difference between them. You may think
that human beings are sadly lacking in this respect, since as children we all had to learn,
rather laboriously, which is which. Yet at an even earlier age, you could no doubt distinguish
the smell of oranges from the smell of lemons, even though this is an achievement at least as
remarkable as getting the right shoe on the right foot. The smells of orange and lemon differ
in being the left- and right-handed versions of the same molecule, limonene. (R)-(+)Limonene smells rounded and orangey; (S)-(–)-limonene is sharp and lemony. Similarly,
spearmint and caraway seeds smell quite different, although again this pair of aromas differs
only in being the enantiomeric forms of the ketone carvone. Evolution has left many of us
regrettably sensitive to (+)-androstenone, the smell of stale human urine. (–)-Androstenone
is essentially odourless.

Even bacteria know their right from their left: Pseudomonas putida can use aromatic hydrocarbons as a foodstuff, degrading them to diols. The diol produced from bromobenzene is
formed as one enantiomer only.
How can this be? We said in Chapter 14 that enantiomers are chemically identical, so how
is it that we can distinguish them with our noses and bacteria can produce them selectively?
Well, the answer lies in a proviso to our assumption about the identity of enantiomers: they
are identical until they are placed in a chiral environment. This concept will underlie all we say
in this chapter about how to make single enantiomers in the laboratory. We take our lead from
nature: all life is chiral, so all living systems are chiral environments.
The sheer complexity of life means that nature has to build its living structures from molecules
that are chiral, principally amino acids and sugars. For all of those chiral molecules, evolution has
forced the use of a single enantiomeric form, for example every amino acid in your body has the
same confi guration (usually labelled S). From this fact derives the larger-scale chirality of all living
structures, from the right-handed double helix of DNA to the location of a blue whale’s internal
organs. The answer to the question posed by Alice at the start of the chapter is most certainly
_no—her kitten’s digestive system will be able to hydrolyse the achiral fats in the looking-glass milk_
quite easily (achiral compounds are superimposable on their mirror image), but looking-glass
proteins (which will be made of D-amino acids) and L-lactose will be quite indigestible.
For a perfumer or fl avour and fragrance manufacturer, the distinction between the differently scented enantiomers of the same molecule is clearly of great importance. Nonetheless, we
could all get by with caraway-fl avoured toothpaste. Yet when it comes to drug molecules, making the right enantiomer can be a matter of life and death. Parkinson’s disease sufferers are
treated with the non-proteinogenic amino acid dopa (3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine). Dopa
is chiral, and only (S)-dopa (known as L-dopa) is effective in restoring nerve function. (R)-Dopa
is not only ineffective, it is quite toxic, so the drug must be marketed as a single enantiomer.

In other cases, only one of the two enantiomers of a drug molecule possesses activity: the
antidepressant citalopram and the painkiller naproxen are both marketed only as their _S_
enantiomer because the R enantiomers are essentially inactive. In a few cases, the enantiomers both have activity, but in different ways: (+)-Darvon and (–)-Novrad are a painkiller and
a cough suppressant, respectively.
It is not only drugs that have to be manufactured enantiomerically pure. This simple lactone
is the pheromone released by the Japanese beetle Popilia japonica as a means of communication.
The beetles, whose larvae are serious crop pests, are attracted by the pheromone, and synthetic
pheromone is marketed as ‘Japonilure’ to bait beetle traps. Provided the synthetic pheromone
is the stereoisomer shown, with the Z double bond and the R confi guration at the stereogenic
centre, only 25 μg per trap catches thousands of beetles. You met this compound in Chapter 27,
where we pointed out that double bond stereocontrol is important since the E isomer of the
pheromone is virtually useless as a bait (it retains only about 10% of the activity). Even more
important is control over the confi guration at the chiral centre because the S enantiomer of the
pheromone is not only inactive in attracting the beetles, but acts as a powerful inhibitor of the
_R enantiomer—even 1% of S enantiomer in a sample of pheromone destroys the activity._
So you see why chemists need to be able to make compounds as single enantiomers. In
Chapters 32 and 33 we looked at relative stereochemistry and how to control it; this chapter is
about how to control absolute stereochemistry. We call this asymmetric synthesis.
In the last 25 years or so, this subject has occupied more organic chemists than possibly any
other, and we are now at a point where it is not only possible (and in fact essential because of
strict regulatory rules) to make many drug molecules as single enantiomers, but it is also even
possible to make many chiral molecules that are indigenous to nature more cheaply in the
laboratory. By 2007, for example, at least 30% of the world’s supply of menthol was not
extracted from plants but made synthetically. A thousand tonnes of (–)-menthol a year is
made by the company Takasago in Japan using the techniques of asymmetric synthesis that
you will meet later in this chapter.

###### The chiral pool: Nature’s chiral centres ‘off the shelf’

When we fi rst introduced you to enantiomers and chirality in Chapter 14, we stressed that any
imbalance in enantiomers always derives ultimately from nature. A laboratory synthesis of a
chiral compound from achiral or racemic starting materials alone always gives a racemic mixture of enantiomers. If you want to make just one enantiomer, you have to use a starting material or reagent which is also just one enantiomer. This seems like a chicken-and-egg situation,
until you realize that nature provides a collection of ‘off the shelf’ enantiomerically pure compounds that we can exploit in various ways. This collection of natural, enantiomerically pure
compounds is called the chiral pool. The principal groups of compounds in the chiral pool are:

**1.** The amino acids. There is a full list of the natural amino acids found in proteins on
p. 554, but for the purposes of this chapter you should make sure you are familiar
with the structures below. They all have simple side chains that are simple alkyl groups
or functionalized chains with plenty of versatile chemistry, and can be obtained by
hydrolysis of protein.

**2.** Simple derivatives of the amino acids: amino alcohols and hydroxy acids. It’s easy to
reduce amino acids to amino alcohols with borane (BH3), usually generated in the
reaction mixture by treating sodium borohydride with concentrated sulfuric acid.
We will use a number of naturally derived amino alcohols as starting materials in
this chapter.

Ephedrine is an amino alcohol which is itself a useful member of the chiral pool—it’s a
plant extract readily available as either diastereoisomer (see p. 314), each, unusually, also
available as either enantiomer.
It’s also easy to make hydroxy acids from amino acids by diazotization. You saw this being
done in Chapter 33, but as a reminder nitrous acid generates a diazonium salt, which undergoes substitution by water via an intermediate α-lactone. Two confi gurational inversions are
involved, so the product alcohol retains S stereochemistry.

Some hydroxy acids are themselves available from nature, and are therefore also members
of the chiral pool: both (R)- and (S)-lactic acid, for example, can be made by bacterial fermentation; mandelic, malic, and tartaric acids are extracted from almonds, apples, and grapes,
respectively.

**3.** Carbohydrates and their derivatives. There are a great many simple carbohydrates
available, but one of the most useful is mannose. Reduction to the alcohol gives the
_C2-symmetric compound mannitol, which can be converted to a useful aldehyde by_
selective protection as a bis-acetal with acetone and a Lewis acid. Cleavage of the
remaining diol with sodium periodate gives two equivalents of a useful protected form
of glyceraldehyde.

This might seem rather long-winded, and long-windedness can be a drawback of syntheses
starting from the chiral pool: you have to shoe-horn your synthetic route into the available
starting materials. Another drawback of syntheses starting from the chiral pool is the fact
that many natural compounds are only available as one enantiomer or, if both enantiomers
are available, one is much more expensive than the other. You will see some ingenious ways
of circumventing this problem later in the chapter, but we deal with a very simple one in the
next section.

###### Resolution can be used to separate enantiomers

In Chapter 14 we introduced you to resolution as a means of separating enantiomers. Resolution
requires an enantiomerically pure resolving agent, which must be a compound from the chiral
pool or a simple derivative of that compound. When the Swiss company Cilag wanted one
enantiomer of the unusual chiral amino acid in the margin in order to make some potential
drug candidates, the chemists there decided the easiest way to get hold of it quickly and in large
quantities was to make it in racemic form and then resolve it. It turned out that one of the two
enantiomers of the protected derivative below forms a crystalline salt with cheap, readily available (–)-ephedrine, while the other remains in solution. Filtration and treatment with acid to
remove the protecting group and protonate the acid gave them a single enantiomer of their
target amino acid.

Of course, with resolution, there is a maximum yield of 50% because if you only want one
enantiomer, the other is wasted. But there are many cases where you might want both enantiomers. You may need to test them both for biological activity, for example. In that case, resolution is ideal—in the example above the chemists at Cilag could get hold of the other
enantiomer of the amino acid just by evaporating the mother liquors from the recrystallization. This is a big advantage of resolution: it lets you get both enantiomers using just one
compound from the chiral pool.

###### Chiral auxiliaries

In Chapter 33 we showed you methods for making single diastereosiomers using diastereoselective reactions. Diastereoselective reactions work just as well whether the starting material is
racemic or enantiomerically pure—you get the same diastereoisomeric outcome in each case,
but if you start with racemic material you get racemic product and if you start with enantiomerically pure material you get enantiomerically pure product. Here’s an example, from p. 867:


**O** **O**

**_m-CPBA_**

**OH** (±) **OH** (±) **OH**

**O** **O**

**_m-CPBA_**
+

**OH** **OH** **OH**

enantiomerically pure 95:5 ratio of diastereoisomers
starting material both must be enantiomerically pure


So if you use a starting material from the chiral pool, you can build new chiral centres in
enantiomerically pure form just by using diastereoselective reactions. We showed you two
syntheses at the end of Chapter 33 using this idea: the chiral pool starting materials (S)-lactic
acid and (S)-serine were converted to two natural products using a series of diastereoselective
reactions to introduce further chiral centres into the molecules.

The syntheses rely on the fact that the structure of the chiral pool starting material is still
there in the product. But the same idea can work even if the starting chiral compound is no
longer part of the target you are making. In this case the chiral starting material is called a
_chiral auxiliary. Chiral auxiliaries are extremely versatile because they can be used to make a_
whole variety of target molecules in enantiomerically pure form. We will explain how they
work with two examples.


-----

The product of a Diels–Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and benzyl acrylate must
necessarily be racemic as both reagents are achiral. Although only one diastereoisomer—the
_endo product—is formed, it must be formed as an exactly 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. There_
is nothing to tell the diene whether to attack the top or the bottom face of the dienophile so
it does both, each 50% of the time.

Now see what happens if we replace the achiral benzyl ester group of the dienophile with an
amide derived from the amino acid valine. Here’s the synthesis of such a dienophile using the
amino acid reduction you saw on p. 1105.

- As we discussed in Chapter
34, the presence of a Lewis acid
increases the rate of Diels–Alder
reactions, and in this case is
also vital for high
stereoselectivity.


**Cl**

The two faces of the double bond of the dienophile are now different because of the chiral
centre: they are diastereotopic, and the diene can distinguish between them. If we now do the
Diels–Alder reaction in the presence of a Lewis acid, Et2AlCl, the aluminium chelates the oxygen atoms of the dienophile to form the rigid and reactive structure shown below. The isopropyl group is held in such a way that its steric bulk prevents the diene attacking that face of the
prochiral alkene. The diene has no choice but to attack from above, and only one of the possible diastereoisomeric products is formed.

We call the green valine-derived part of this molecule the _chiral auxiliary—it assists the_
substrate to react in a diastereoselective way such that only one of the two possible products
is allowed to form. The chiral auxiliary was enantiomerically pure to start with, so the product must be diastereoisomerically and enantiomerically pure.
Finally comes the step which shows the power of chiral auxiliary strategy: we just remove
the chiral auxiliary from the product by treating with a nucleophile. The auxiliary can in
principle be used again, but most importantly of all, the product obtained is just one of the
two enantiomers we made in the racemic version of this reaction. This isn’t a resolution—all

Overall, by sequential attachment of the auxiliary, diastereoselective reaction, and removal
of the auxiliary we have made the same product but as a single enantiomer.



- **This is what we mean by a chiral auxiliary strategy**

**1** **An enantiomerically pure compound (usually derived from a simple natural product like an**
**amino acid), called a chiral auxiliary, is attached to the starting material.**

**2** **A diastereoselective reaction is carried out, which, because of the enantiomeric purity of**
**the chiral auxiliary, gives only one enantiomer of the product.**

**3** **The chiral auxiliary is removed by, for example, hydrolysis, leaving the product of the**
**reaction as a single enantiomer. The best chiral auxiliaries (of which the example above is**
**one) can be recycled, so although stoichiometric quantities are needed, there is no waste.**


We have introduced you to this chiral auxiliary before any other because it is more commonly used than any other. It is a member of the oxazolidinone (the name of the heterocyclic
ring) family of auxiliaries developed by David Evans at Harvard University, and is easily and
cheaply made from the amino acid (S)-valine. Even though it is cheap, it can be recycled. The
last step of the route above regenerates the auxiliary ready for re-use.
The most versatile chiral auxiliaries should also be available as both enantiomers. For the
valine-derived one here, this is not the case—(R)-valine is quite expensive since it is not found
in nature. However, by starting with the naturally occurring (and cheap) compound norephedrine, we can make an auxiliary that, although not enantiomeric with the one derived
from (S)-valine, acts as though it were.

As the diagram shows, the two substituents of the auxiliary lie on the top face of the dienophile and force the cyclopentadiene this time to attack the bottom face. Now when the auxiliary is cleaved from the product the opposite enantiomer is formed. We can choose which
enantiomer we want simply by choosing the right auxiliary for the job.

###### Alkylation of enolates

Chiral auxiliaries can be used in plenty of other reactions, and some of the most common are
reactions of enolates. Evans’s oxazolidinone auxiliaries are particularly appropriate here


-----

because they are readily turned into enolizable carboxylic acid derivatives. Treatment with
base (usually LDA) at low temperature produces an enolate, the bulky auxiliary means that
only the cis enolate forms: the trans enolate is too hindered.

As you can see, none of these reactions is truly 100% diastereoselective and, indeed, only
the best chiral auxiliaries (of which this is certainly one) give >98% of a single diastereoisomer. The problem with less than perfect diastereoselectivity is that, when the chiral auxiliary
is removed, the fi nal product is contaminated with some of the other enantiomer. A 94:6 ratio
of diastereoisomers will result in a 94:6 ratio of enantiomers, or a sample of 94:6 e.r. (e.r. for
enantiomeric ratio).

###### Enantiomeric excess

Compounds that are neither racemic nor enantiomerically pure are usually called enantio_merically enriched. Chemists have two ways of referring to the ratio of enantiomers in an_
enantiomerically enriched sample. The fi rst is the simple one we have just used: e.r. or enantiomeric ratio, expressed as two numbers adding to 100. More common, however, is to
express this ratio as an enantiomeric excess. Enantiomeric excess (or ee) is defi ned as the excess
of one enantiomer over the other, expressed as a percentage of the whole. So a 94:6 mixture
of enantiomers consists of one enantiomer in 88% excess over the other, and we call it an
enantiomerically enriched mixture with 88% ee. Why not just say that we have 94% of one
enantiomer? Enantiomers are not like other isomers because they are simply mirror images.
The 6% of the minor enantiomer can be paired with 6% of the major isomer to form a racemic mixture amounting to 12% of the total. The mixture contains 12% racemate and 88% of
one enantiomer, hence 88% ee.

We will see shortly how we can make further use of the chiral auxiliary to increase the ee of
the reaction products. But fi rst, we should consider how to measure ee. One way is simply to
measure the angle through which the sample rotates plane-polarized light. The angle of rotation is approximately proportional to the enantiomeric excess of the sample (see box). The
problem with this method is that to measure an actual value for ee you need to know what
rotation a sample of 100% ee gives, and that is not always possible. Also, polarimeter measurements are notoriously unreliable—they depend on temperature, solvent, and concentration,
and are subject to massive error due to small amounts of highly optically active impurities.


###### Is optical rotation proportional to enantiomeric excess?

Imagine you have a sample, A, of an enantiomerically pure compound—a natural product perhaps—and, using a polarimeter, you fi nd that it has an [α]D of +10.0. Another sample, B, of the same compound, which you know to be chemically
pure (perhaps it is a synthetic sample), shows an [α]D of +8.0. What is its enantiomeric excess? Well, you would have got
the same value of 8.0 for the [α]D of B if you had mixed 80% of your enantiomerically pure sample A with 20% of a
racemic (or achiral) compound with no optical rotation. Since you know that sample B is chemically pure, and is the same
compound as A, it must therefore indeed consist of 80% enantiomerically pure material plus 20% racemic material, or
80% of one enantiomer plus 20% of a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers—which is the same as 90% of one enantiomer
and 10% of the other, or 80% enantiomeric excess. Optical rotations can give a guide to enantiomeric excess—sometimes
called optical purity in this context—but slight impurities of compounds with large rotations can distort the result and
there are some examples where the linear relationship between ee and optical rotation fails because of what is known as
the Horeau effect. You can read more about this in Eliel and Wilen, Stereochemistry of organic compounds, Wiley, 1994.


Chemists now usually use chromatography, or occasionally spectroscopy, to quantify ratios of
enantiomers. You may think that this should be impossible—since enantiomers are chemically
identical and have identical NMR spectra, how can chromatography or spectroscopy tell them
apart? Well, again, they are identical unless they are in a chiral environment. We introduced HPLC
on a chiral stationary phase as a way of separating enantiomers preparatively in Chapter 14. The
same method can be used analytically—less than a milligram of chiral compound can be passed
down a narrow column containing silica modifi ed which a chiral additive. One enantiomer
passes through the silica faster than the other; the two enantiomers are separated and the quantity of each can be measured (usually by UV absorption or by refractive index changes) and an
ee derived. Gas chromatography can be used in the same way—the columns are packed with a
chiral stationary phase such as the isoleucine derivative shown in the margin.
Distinguishing enantiomers spectroscopically relies again on putting them into a chiral
environment. One way of doing this, if the compound is, say, an alcohol or an amine, is to
make a derivative (an ester or an amide) with an enantiomerically pure and racemizationproof acyl chloride. The one most commonly used is known as Mosher’s acyl chloride, after
its inventor Harry Mosher, although there are many others. The two enantiomers of the
alcohol or amine now become diastereoisomeric esters, and give different sets of peaks in
the NMR spectrum—the integrals can be used to determine ee and, although the [1]H NMR
of such a mixture of diastereoisomers may become quite cluttered because it is a mixture,
the presence of the CF3 group means that the ratio can alternatively be measured by integrating the two singlets in the otherwise featureless plain of the [19]F NMR spectrum.

Another powerful method of discriminating between enantiomers is to add an enantiomerically pure compound to the NMR sample that simply forms a complex with the compound
under investigation. The complexes formed from the two opposite enantiomers are diastereoisomeric, and therefore have different chemical shifts and, by integrating the NMR signals,
the ratio of enantiomers can be determined. Among the most commonly used is this alcohol,
2,2,2-trifl uoro-1-(9-anthryl)ethanol, or TFAE, which can both hydrogen-bond to and form

π-stacked complexes with a range of functionalized compounds, and often splits NMR signals
due to enantiomeric compounds very cleanly.
Time to go back to chiral auxiliaries. We pointed out that, although we want to get maximum levels of stereoselectivity in our chiral-auxiliary-controlled reaction, we may still have
a small percentage of a minor diastereoisomer, which, once we have removed our chiral auxiliary, will compromise the ee of our fi nal product. It is at this point that we can use a trick that
essentially employs the chiral auxiliary in a secondary role as a resolving agent. Provided the
products are crystalline, it will usually be possible to recrystallize our 94:6 mixture of diastereoisomers to give essentially a single diastereoisomer, rather like carrying out a resolution
with an enormous head start. Once this has been done, the chiral auxiliary can be removed
and the product may be very close to 100% ee. Of course, the recrystallization sacrifi ces a few
percentage points of yield, but these are invariably much less valuable than the few percentage points of ee gained! Here is an example from the work of Evans himself. During his synthesis of the complex antibiotic X-206 he needed large quantities of the small molecule below.
He decided to make it by a chiral-auxiliary-controlled allylation, followed by reduction to give
the alcohol. The auxiliary needed is the one derived from norephedrine, and the reaction of
the enolate with allyl iodide gives a 98:2 mixture of diastereoisomers. However, recrystallization converts this into an 83% yield of a single diastereoisomer in >99% purity, giving material of essentially 100% ee after removal of the auxiliary.

- At this point we should also
come clean about the
asymmetric Diels–Alder reaction
we introduced on p. 1108: it is
not quite as selective as we
implied—a minor
diastereoisomer is formed in a
7% yield, with the major isomer
accounting for 93%. But just
one recrystallization gives >99%
diastereoisomerically pure
material in 81% yield.


This is one big bonus of using a chiral auxiliary—it’s much easier to purify diastereoisomers
than enantiomers and a chiral auxiliary-controlled reaction necessarily produces diastereoisomeric products.
Both these examples of auxiliary-controlled alkylation make use of LiAlH4 reduction to the
alcohol in the step which removes the auxiliary. You saw attack with an alkoxide above, and
several other alternative methods are possible as well, summarized below. DIBAL (i-Bu2AlH,
p. 533) reduces the product to an aldehyde, while converting the product to a Weinreb amide
(p. 219) makes formation of a ketone possible.

These various ways of removing auxiliaries illustrate the ways in which it is possible to make
a virtue out of one of their big disadvantages: chiral auxiliaries must fi rst be attached to the
compound under construction, and after they have done their job they must be removed. The
best auxiliaries can be recycled, but even then there are still at least two ‘unproductive’ steps
in the synthesis.

###### Oxazolidinones are not the only auxiliaries

Other auxiliaries are also used, and the choice of auxiliary may depend not only on the selectivity of the reaction under
investigation but also on the physical properties of the products. The camphor-based auxiliary of Oppolzer is reputed to
confer crystallinity on its derivatives, while the pseudoephedrine auxiliary of Myers is cheap, readily available, and very
easy to introduce. More bulky auxiliaries such as 8-phenylmenthol work well where control over long-range interactions,
such as conjugate additions, are required.

###### Chiral reagents

A chiral auxiliary is a chiral molecule attached to the starting material of the reaction; diastereoselective reactions of compounds from the chiral pool are likewise controlled by chirality in the starting material, and we call this type of stereocontrol substrate control. But is it
also possible for enantioselective reactions to be controlled by chiral reagents. For example, a
typical achiral base will just remove a proton from a substrate, but an enantiomerically pure
chiral base can select one of two enantiotopic protons and form a product enantioselectively.
The product of course has to be chiral, so we can’t use a chiral base to make planar enolates
enantioselectively, for example, but we can a chiral base to make chiral organolithiums.
Alkyllithiums are suffi ciently strong as bases to remove the protons adjacent to the nitrogen
atom of N-Boc pyrrolidine, shown in the margin. The product of deprotonation is an organolithium which is a chiral molecule: the lithium-bearing carbon is chiral.
Alkyllithiums can be turned into chiral bases in quite a simple way—by complexation with
a chiral ligand. A widely used example is the tetracyclic diamine (–)-sparteine. Sparteine’s
structure looks complex, but it is a relatively widely available natural product which folds
around the lithium atom of an alkyllithium and places the base in a chiral environment.

One of the reasons this reaction is so useful is that the products happen to be derivatives of
the less readily available (R)-proline. But, as with chiral auxiliaries, if you use a chiral reagent
you need a full equivalent of the source of enantiomeric purity (here, (–)-sparteine) which can
get prohibitively expensive on a large scale. It is for this reason that the real pinnacles of
achievement in asymmetric synthesis make use of asymmetric catalysis, which we turn to next.

###### Asymmetric catalysis

If we want to create a new chiral centre in a molecule, our starting material must have pro**chirality—the ability to become chiral in one simple transformation. The most common**
prochiral units that give rise to new chiral centres are the trigonal carbon atoms of alkenes
and carbonyl groups, which become tetrahedral by addition reactions. In the last section you
saw a prochiral, tetrahedral CH2 group becoming a chiral organolithium by enantioselective
removal of one enantiotopic proton. Much more common are the reactions you saw in the
section before that, where in every case a prochiral alkene (we can count enolates as alkenes
for this purpose) reacted selectively on one face because of the infl uence of the chiral auxiliary, which made the faces of the alkene diastereotopic.

###### Catalytic asymmetric reduction of ketones

One of the simplest transformations you could imagine of a prochiral unit into a chiral one is
the reduction of a ketone. Although chiral auxiliary strategies have been used to make this
type of reaction asymmetric, conceptually the simplest way of getting the product as a single
enantiomer would be to use a chiral reducing agent—in other words, to attach the chiral
infl uence not to the substrate (as we did with chiral auxiliaries) but to the reagent. We need an
asymmetric version of NaBH4.

- The fact that the reactions
are catalytic in the heterocycle
means that relatively little is
needed. Note the distinction
from chiral auxiliaries here:
although auxiliaries are
recoverable, they always have to
be used in stoichiometric
quantities and recovery is
usually a separate step. Later in
the chapter you will see catalytic
reactions that use 1000 times
less catalyst than this one.


One of the more widely used solutions to this challenge is the chiral borohydride analogue
invented by Itsuno in Japan and developed by Corey, Bakshi, and Shibata. It is based on a
stable boron heterocycle made from an amino alcohol derived from proline (see the box below
for the synthesis), and is known as the CBS catalyst after its developers. The active reducing
agent is generated when the heterocycle forms a complex with borane. Only catalytic amounts
(usually about 10%) of the boron heterocycle are needed because borane is suffi ciently reactive to reduce ketones only when complexed with the nitrogen atom. The rest of the borane
just waits until a molecule of catalyst becomes free.

catalyst brings together the borane (which complexes to its basic nitrogen atom) and the
carbonyl compound (which complexes to its Lewis-acidic boron atom). Complexation activates both partners towards reaction: donating electron density to the borane is essential to
persuade it to transfer hydride, and withdrawing electron density from the carbonyl group
makes it electrophilic enough to react with a weak hydride source. The hydride is delivered via
a six-membered cyclic transition state, with the enantioselectivity arising from the preference of
the larger of the ketone’s two substituents (RL ) for the pseudoequatorial position on this ring.

###### Making the CBS catalyst

To make the CBS heterocycle, (S)-proline has to be protected as its N-Cbz derivative (Chapter 23) and converted to its
methyl ester. Esters react with Grignard twice to give tertiary alcohols (Chapter 10), so PhMgBr followed by deprotection
gives the amino alcohol needed. Condensation with methylboronic acid (MeB(OH)2) gives the stable catalyst.

To make the other enantiomer, you would need the rather more expensive ‘unnatural’ (R)-proline, which you can make by the
method of p. 1114, but in such a case you might consider using one of the alternative reduction methods described below.

Until recently, the CBS reagent was one of the most commonly used asymmetric reducing
agents for ketones. But in the early years of the 21st century a new reaction has taken over that
role—one in which the job of bringing together the ketone and the reducing agent is taken by
an atom of ruthenium. The ruthenium is added as Ru(II) in a 16-electron complex (see p. 1116)
with an aromatic compound such as 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (known as mesitylene). A chiral
ligand is needed—the diamine derivative shown here is best. Only very small amounts (often
<< 1%) of the catalyst and ligand are required, which is a good thing as both are much more
expensive than the reagents in the CBS reduction. The reducing agent itself can be hydrogen
or, more conveniently, a more easily handled source of hydrogen atoms such as isopropanol
(which gets oxidized to acetone) or formic acid (which gets oxidized to carbon dioxide). Here’s
a typical example; we will explain how it works shortly.

This revolution in asymmetric
catalysis using chiral complexes
of transition metals was made
possible principally by the work
of Ryoji Noyori (who developed
the Ru- and Rh-catalysed reductions we describe in this chapter)
and of K. Barry Sharpless (who
developed the Os- and
Ti-catalysed oxidations). This
work won Noyori and Sharpless
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in
2001, along with William
Knowles (who was the fi rst to
apply metal-catalysed asymmetric
reactions to industrial targets).


You have met several reactions of ruthenium complexes, especially in Chapters 38 and
40, where you saw ruthenium carbenes catalysing the metathesis of alkenes. Ruthenium is
one of a select group of transition metals (Pd, Ru, Rh, Cu, Os, and Ti being the others)
which play an important role in asymmetric catalysis. The key to their success is the transition metal coordination chemistry we looked at in the last chapter: the metals can act as
coordination sites for substrates, and by using other ligands which are chiral and enantiomerically pure, the reactions they catalyse can be made to take place in an asymmetric
environment.
The ruthenium-catalysed reduction of ketones starts with coordination of the tosyl-diamine
ligand ((S,S)-N-toluenesulfonyl 1,2-phenylenediamine, or ‘TsDPEN’) to the ruthenium metal.
This is a 16-electron complex, and can be reduced by formic acid to an 18-electron ruthenium
hydride.

Now comes the reduction. Provided the ketone approaches the ruthenium complex in
the right orientation, with the smaller methyl group tucked in under the ruthenium and
the larger aryl group pointing away from the bulky ligands, the 18e complex can transfer
to the carbonyl group simultaneously H[−] from Ru and H[+] from the protonated nitrogen.
The chiral ligand means that the alcohol is formed as a single enantiomer, and the ruthenium catalyst is regenerated.

using hydrogenation with a

changed in little more than a
decade.


The reduction shown below is particularly important because it generates a late intermediate in the industrial synthesis of the anti-asthma drug montelukast (Singulair).
Several methods have been used, but in 2008 chemists at the Croatian pharmaceutical
company Pliva patented a method using the ruthenium catalyst with a derivative of
TsDPEN as a ligand to gives the product in 83% yield and 99.8% ee on a scale of several

###### Catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of alkenes

Reduction of a ketone can give a chiral secondary alcohol, but reduction of an alkene by
addition of hydrogen to one of its two enantiotopic faces can give all sorts of products,
creating either one or two chiral centres, depending on the substituents on the alkene. By
way of illustration (and explanation will follow soon) the alkene hydrogenation below
creates, in one step, the two chiral centres of a precursor to the anti-obesity drug taranabant. A single diastereoisomer is formed by syn addition of hydrogen, and a chiral ligand
ensures that one enantiomer is formed preferentially.

You have seen numerous hydrogenations of alkenes using hydrogen over a solid catalyst of
palladium supported on charcoal (‘heterogeneous hydrogenation’), but catalytic asymmetric
hydrogenation of alkenes uses a different type of catalyst—a soluble complex, often of Ru or
Rh with phosphine-containing ligands. The substrates for asymmetric alkene hydrogenation
are also more limited than those for hydrogenation with Pd/C because they must carry a functional group close to the alkene, allowing coordination to the transition metal catalyst. In the
example above, that functional group is the amide directly adjacent to the alkene.
The inspiration for these catalysts came from the work of Wilkinson in London in the 1960s,
who showed that RhCl(PPh3)3 (known as Wilkinson’s catalyst) promoted homogeneous hydrogenation of alkenes (i.e. during the reaction there is only one, solution, phase). Wilkinson’s
catalyst is a 16-electron complex of Rh(I), and it works as a catalyst because it can easily lose
one of the phosphine ligands to form a 14-electron complex. This undergoes addition of H2,
giving a 16-electron Ru(III) complex.

The complex is still coordinatively unsaturated, so an alkene can form a π complex with a

by reductive elimination, gives back the 14-electron Rh complex and the reduced alkane.

The conceptual advance which allows this sort of hydrogenation to become asymmetric is
the replacement of the two achiral triphenylphosphine ligands of Wilkinson’s catalyst with
chiral phosphine ligands. Notice that two of the triphenylphosphines remain coordinated
through the whole reaction mechanism, so by doing this we can ensure that the Rh always
remains in a chiral environment.
The usual solution is to use one chiral molecule containing two phosphorus atoms, and the
most important of these is BINAP. BINAP is a chelating diphosphine: the metal sits between
the two phosphorus atoms, fi rmly anchored in a chiral environment. The chirality here is of
an unusual sort, since BINAP, which you met in Chapter 14 (p. 319), has no chiral centres. It
is one of the class of chiral molecules, known as atropisomers, whose chirality arises from the
inability of the bond between the two naphthalene rings to rotate.
Incorporating (S)- or (R)-BINAP into a hydrogenation with Rh can lead to high enantiomeric
excesses in the products because during the migratory insertion step the complex is forced to
transfer hydrogen to only one of the two possible enantiotopic faces of the alkene. As we
remarked before, asymmetric hydrogenations require a functional group which can coordinate to the metal, and with Rh the best substrates are N-acyl enamines. Those of the type
shown below give excellent results, and usefully with (S)-BINAP the products are protected
amino acids of the opposite enantiomeric series to those found in nature.

this reaction is too complicated
for us to examine here.
Unusually, it involves two
diastereoisomeric complexes, of
which the more reactive is the
one which is less favoured.

It is even economical for the more expensive of the natural amino acids to be made synthetically by this type of reaction rather than isolated from natural sources—phenylalanine,
which is of industrial importance as a component of the artifi cial sweetener aspartame
(NutraSweet), is manufactured using enantioselective hydrogenation.
Noyori found that using ruthenium instead of rhodium broadens greatly the scope of the
substrates that will undergo asymmetric hydrogenation. They still need a functional group—
usually the OH group of an alcohol or a carboxylic acid—to allow coordination to the metal,
but the alkene itself can be a simple allylic alcohol or unsaturated acid derivative. BINAP is
again a good ligand, and of course by choosing which enantiomer of BINAP you use you can
choose which enantiomer of the product you get.

Two important industrial asymmetric syntheses which routinely use this chemistry are the

Reduction of unsaturated carboxylic acids gives products that you might alternatively think
of making by auxiliary-controlled alkylation methods. When the NutraSweet company
needed this chiral branched carboxylic acid as a single enantiomer, they initially used the
auxiliary methods of p. 1110 to make a small amount, but they found that ruthenium-catalysed hydrogenation was greatly to be preferred on a large scale: just 22 g of the ruthenium(S)-BINAP complex is needed to produce 50 kg of product with 90% ee.

In the last 20 years, the variety of ligands available for rhodium and ruthenium-catalysed
hydrogenations has increased to the point where the right combination of metal and ligand
will reduce almost any unsaturated carboxylic acid derivative in high enantiomeric excess.

###### Resolution of BINAP

BINAP is not derived from a natural product, and has to be synthesized in the laboratory and resolved using a naturally
derived resolving agent. The scheme shows one method by which enantiomerically pure BINAP may be made—the resolution step is unusual because it relies on formation of a molecular complex, not a salt. The bis phosphine oxide of
(S)-BINAP co-crystallizes with di-O-benzoyl-L-tartrate, leaving the (R)-phosphine oxide in solution. Base releases the pure
(R)-phosphine oxide that is resolved, which is then reduced to the phosphine with trichlorosilane.

K. B. Sharpless (1941–) studied
at Stanford and was fi rst
appointed at MIT but is now at
the Scripps Institute in
California. His undoubted claim
to fame rests on the invention
of no fewer than three reactions
of immense signifi cance: asymmetric epoxidation (AE) and
asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD)
are discussed in this chapter.
The third reaction, asymmetric
aminohydroxylation (AA), has
still to reach the perfection of
the fi rst two.


###### Asymmetric epoxidation

Asymmetric hydrogenation of an alkene can create two new chiral centres, but introduces no
new functionality as it does so. Asymmetric oxidation of an alkene is different: it can create
two new chiral centres and two new functional groups at the same time. We will now look at
two examples of asymmetric oxidation, both products of the laboratories of Professor Barry
Sharpless.
The fi rst of Sharpless’s reactions is an oxidation of alkenes by asymmetric epoxidation. You
met vanadium as a transition-metal catalyst for epoxidation with t-butyl hydroperoxide in
Chapter 32, and this new reaction makes use of titanium, as titanium tetraisopropoxide,
Ti(Oi-Pr)4, to do the same thing. Sharpless and his co-worker Tsutomu Katsuki surmised that
by adding a chiral ligand to the titanium catalyst they might be able to make the reaction
asymmetric. The ligand that works best is diethyl tartrate, and one example of the reaction is
shown below.

Transition-metal-catalysed epoxidations work only on allylic alcohols, so this is a limitation
of the method, but otherwise there are few restrictions on what can be epoxidized enantioselectively, and when this reaction was discovered in 1981 it was by far the best asymmetric
reaction known. Because of its importance, a lot of work went into discovering exactly how
the reaction worked, and the scheme below shows what is believed to be the active complex,
formed from two titanium atoms bridged by two tartrate ligands (shown in orange). Each
titanium atom retains two of its isopropoxide ligands and is coordinated to one of the carbonyl groups of the tartrate ligand. The reaction works best if the titanium and tartrate are left
to stir for a while so that these dimers can form cleanly. When the oxidizing agent (t-BuOOH,
shown in green) is added to the mixture, it displaces one of the remaining isopropoxide
ligands and one of the tartrate carbonyl groups.

For this oxidizing complex to react with an allylic alcohol, the alcohol must become
co ordinated to the titanium too, displacing a further isopropoxide ligand. Because of the shape


-----

of the complex the reactive oxygen atom of the bound hydroperoxide has to be delivered to the
lower face of the alkene (as drawn), and the epoxide is formed in high enantiomeric excess.
Displacement of the product by another molecule of hydroperoxide starts the cycle again.

Different allylic alcohols coordinate in the same way to the titanium and reliably present
the same enantiotopic face to the bound oxidizing agent, and the preference for oxidation
with L-(+)-DET is shown in the schematic diagram below. Tartrate is ideal as a chiral ligand
because it is available relatively cheaply as either enantiomer. L-tartrate is extracted from
grapes; D-(–)-tartrate is rarer and more expensive, but still cheap by the standards of some of
the bisphosphine ligands used in the last section. By using D-(–)-tartrate it is, of course, possible to produce the other enantiomer of the epoxide equally selectively.

Sharpless also found that this reaction works with only a catalytic amount of titanium–
tartrate complex because the reaction products can be displaced from the metal centre by
more of the two reagents. The catalytic version of the asymmetric epoxidation is well suited
to industrial exploitation, and the American company J. T. Baker has employed it to make
synthetic disparlure, the pheromone of the gypsy moth, by oxidation of the epoxy alcohol
to an aldehyde with pyridinium dichromate (PDC) (p. 543), Wittig reaction (p. 689), and
hydrogenation.

Not many target molecules are themselves epoxides, but the great thing about the epoxide
products is that they are highly versatile—they react with many types of nucleophiles to give
1,2-disubstituted products. You met the chiral beta-blocker drug propranolol in Chapter 28,
and its 1,2,3-substitution pattern makes it a good candidate for synthesis using asymmetric
epoxidation.

Unfortunately, the obvious starting material, allyl alcohol itself, gives an epoxide that is
hard to handle, so Sharpless, who carried out this synthesis of propranolol, used this siliconsubstituted allylic alcohol instead. The hydroxyl group was mesylated and displaced with
1-naphthoxide and, after treatment with fl uoride to remove the silicon, the epoxide was
opened with isopropylamine.

Chemists at the drug company Wyeth needed the amine shown in the margin. The
1,2,3-functional group pattern led them to think of using the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation, and epoxidation of a fl uorinated allylic alcohol using D-(–)-diisopropyl tartrate (DIPT)
gave them the enantiomer they wanted with slightly better selectivity than diethyl tartrate.
The benzylic end of the epoxide is more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution, and in the
presence of Ti(Oi-Pr)4, this time simply acting as a Lewis acid, the lithiated heterocycle opens
the epoxide with inversion of confi guration.

Finally, it’s necessary to bring in the amino group, and this can be done by tosylating the

- ‘Salen’ is an abbreviation of
salicylethylenediamine and
simpler salens had long been
used as tetradentate ligands for
coordination chemistry.


The Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation is reliable, but it works only for allylic alcohols.
There is an alternative, however, which works with simple alkenes. The method was developed by Eric Jacobsen and employs a manganese catalyst with a chiral ligand built from a
simple diamine. The diamine is not a natural compound and has to be made in enantiomeric form by resolution, but at least that means that both enantiomers are readily available. The diamine is condensed with a derivative of salicylaldehyde to make a bis-imine
known as a ‘salen’.

Mn(III) sits neatly in a tetracoordinate pocket in the ligand, and catalyses the epoxidation
of simple alkenes by sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl, ordinary domestic bleach. Best results are
obtained when the alkenes are cis (although an alternative range of ligands, developed by
Tsutomu Katsuki, work well with trans alkenes), and one of the most signifi cant applications
of the Jacobsen epoxidation is with indene, which gives an epoxide in 84% ee with <1% of the
catalyst. The mechanism of the reaction is complex and not fully understood, although it
probably involves a Mn(V) oxo species and may involve radical intermediates.

Together, the epoxidations of Sharpless, Jacobsen, and Katsuki, plus others we do not have
space to cover, provide valuable solutions to many synthetic problems—in particular because
epoxides are such useful reactive synthetic intermediates. But no epoxidation reaction is as
general as the oxidation reaction we cover next.

###### Asymmetric dihydroxylation

This alternative asymmetric oxidation really is probably the best asymmetric reaction of all.
It is an asymmetric version of the syn dihydroxylation of alkenes by osmium tetroxide. Here
is an example—although the concept is quite simple, the recipe for the reactions is complicated so we need to approach it step by step.


asymmetric dihydroxylation—the reaction:


catalytic OsO4


**OH**

The active reagent is based on osmium(VIII) and is used in just catalytic amounts. This
means that there has to be a stoichiometric quantity of another oxidant to reoxidize the
osmium after each catalytic cycle—K3Fe(CN)6 is most commonly used. Because OsO4 is volatile and toxic, the osmium is usually added as K2OsO2(OH)4, which forms OsO4 in the reaction
mixture. The ‘other additives’ include K2CO3 and methanesulfonamide (MeSO2NH2), which
increases the rate of the reaction by regenerating the catalyst at the end of each catalytic cycle.
Now for the chiral ligand. Tertiary amines are good ligands for osmium and increase the rate
of dihydroxylations: one of the reasons that NMO is used in the racemic version of the reaction
(see p. 442) is that the by-product, N-methylmorpholine, accelerates the reaction. Sharpless
chose some available chiral tertiary amines as ligands, and it turned out that the best ones are
based on the alkaloids dihydroquinidine and dihydroquinine, whose structures are shown
below. They coordinate to the osmium through the green nitrogen atom.

We can sum up the usual selectivity of the AD reaction with the diagram shown below.
With the substrate arranged as shown, with the largest (RL) and next largest (RM) groups bottom left and top right, respectively, DHQD-based ligands will direct OsO4 to dihydroxylate
from the top face of the alkene and DHQ-based ligands the bottom face.

The reason for this must come from the way in which the substrate interacts with the
osmium–ligand complex. However, the detailed mechanism of the asymmetric dihydroxylation is still far from clear-cut. What is known is that the ligand forms some sort of ‘chiral
pocket’, like an enzyme active site, with the osmium sitting at the bottom of it. Alkenes can
only approach the osmium if they are correctly aligned in the chiral pocket, and steric hindrance forces the alignment shown in the scheme above. The analogy with an enzyme active

Dihydroquinine and dihydroquinidine are not enantiomeric (although the chiral centres
ringed in orange are of opposite confi guration in each of the pairs, those ringed in brown
remain the same in both), but they act on the dihydroxylation as though they were.
Here, after all that introduction, is a real example, and probably the most remarkable of any
in this chapter. trans-Stilbene dihydroxylates more selectively than any other alkene, and this
particular example is one of the most enantioselective catalytic reactions ever invented.


-----

site goes even further, since it appears that part of the pocket is ‘attractive’ to aromatic or
strongly hydrophobic groups. This part appears to accommodate RL, part of the reason why
the selectivity in the dihydroxylation of trans-stilbene is so high.
The asymmetric dihydroxylation is much less fussy about the alkenes it will oxidize than
Sharpless’ asymmetric epoxidation. Osmium tetroxide itself is a remarkable reagent, since it
oxidizes more or less any sort of alkene, electron-rich or electron-poor, and the same is true of
the asymmetric dihydroxylation reagent. The following example illustrates both this and a
synthetic use for the diol product.



- You can account for this by
considering the mechanism of
the dihydroxylation reaction
(p. 905): it’s a cycloaddition, so
either the LUMO or the HOMO
of the alkene can be involved.

The chemists at Lilly in Spain who made this diol wanted to turn it into the protected amino
acid shown after the dotted arrow as part of the synthesis of an anti-HIV compound. The ease
with which diols can be made means that there are a number of reliable methods for transforming them into derivatives which undergo the sort of substitution needed. The one used
here was to make the diol into a cyclic sulfate using sulfuryl chloride, SO2Cl2. Cyclic sulfates
behave like epoxides, and this one opens easily with azide at the more reactive position adjacent to the carbonyl group. Hydrolysis of the remaining sulfate ester, hydrogenation of the
azide to the amine, and protection with Boc gave the target compound.



- We explained in Chapter 15
that SN2 reactions adjacent to
carbonyl groups are very fast.
The regioselectivity of the ring
opening of a cyclic sulfate, like
that of an epoxide, is directed
by the competition between
relative rates of two nucleophilic
substitution reactions. Benzylic
and carbonyl-substituted
positions usually open faster.
There is more discussion of the
regioselectivity of epoxide

An alternative way of achieving the same transformation to the cyclic sulfate is to use thionyl
chloride (SOCl2) to give a sulfite, followed by ruthenium-catalysed oxidation to the sulfate.
Diols can even be converted with retention of stereochemistry directly to epoxides.
Treatment of a diol with trimethyl orthoacetate and acetyl bromide gives fi rstly the cyclic
orthoester, which opens with bromide to a regioisomeric mixture of the bromoacetates. The
regiochemistry is irrelevant because treatment with base hydrolyses the ester and closes both
of the resulting bromoalcohols to the same epoxide.

It’s no surprise that when chemists from Bristol Myers Squibb needed the epoxide below,
they turned to asymmetric dihydroxylation rather than either of the epoxidation methods we
have shown you. Sharpless epoxidation works only with allylic alcohols, and Jacobsen epoxidation performs poorly here, giving only 70–74% ee (mainly because the substrate is not a cis
alkene). However, asymmetric dihydroxylation saves the day with 98% ee and around 90%
yield, and a variant of the reaction we have just shown you gives the epoxide, also in 90%
yield—well worth the extra step.

- In this section we will not
consider the detailed
mechanisms by which the
stereochemistry of the ligand
controls the stereochemistry of
the product: in many cases this
is not known anyway. We simply
want to show you how the idea
of ligand-accelerated catalysis
has led to the discovery of new
asymmetric reactions.


Asymmetric dihydroxylation is such a good reaction not just because of the careful way in
which the ligands have been designed. It is a good reaction for a more fundamental reason:
the reaction on which it is based (osmium-catalysed dihydroxylation) works only very poorly
in the absence of the amine ligand. The chiral amine ligands don’t just provide a chiral environment, they accelerate the reaction at the same time. This is what we mean by ‘ligand
accelerated catalysis’.

this should be fast:

**(R)-product + (S)-product**

racemic 'background' reaction

reduce ee of product

In any asymmetric reaction, we want the reagents to combine with one another only in the
presence of the asymmetric infl uence provided by the chiral ligands. If the reaction works
anyway, even without the chiral ligands, we have an uphill struggle because the reagents are
quite capable of producing racemic product on their own. Racemic ‘background’ reactions are
the reason why many of the reactions you are familiar with because they work so well racemically—addition of Grignard reagents to aldehydes, for example—don’t really have good asymmetric versions. In the next section you will meet some more examples of reactions which are
signifi cantly accelerated by the presence of a chiral ligand.

###### Asymmetric formation of carbon–carbon bonds

One of the fi rst reactions you met in this book (Chapters 6 and 9) was the addition of an
organo metallic reagent to an aldehyde or a ketone. If the products of such an addition are
chiral they are of course racemic. How might we make such a reaction enantioselective? One
way would be to exploit the idea of ligand-accelerated catalysis and use a reaction which really
doesn’t work very well in the racemic series.
This is the case when the organometallic reagent is a dialkylzinc. Diethylzinc is commercially
available as a solution in toluene or hexane, but it reacts only very slowly with an aldehyde


-----

if the two are just left to stir together. However, if a chiral amino alcohol is added, the reaction
becomes much faster. The amino alcohol forms a zinc alkoxide in the reaction mixture, and the
coordination of this anionic chiral ligand to zinc both accelerates the transfer of zinc’s alkyl
groups to the aldehyde and makes that transfer enantioselective.

###### Asymmetric conjugate addition

In Chapter 22 we discussed the fact that copper promotes conjugate addition to electrondefi cient double bonds. We can again exploit the low reactivity of organozinc compounds
with carbonyl compounds, and with alkenes, if we add a catalytic amount of copper and a
chiral phosphorus-containing ligand based on the atropisomeric binaphthyl structure you
saw in BINAP. The organozinc has to transmetallate to the organocopper in order to react, and
the copper always remains bound to the chiral ligand. Conjugate addition can only take place
in a chiral environment, and good ees result.

It will not have escaped your notice that most of the reactions we have presented in this chapter have made use of metals. Metals have labile coordination sites that can carry chiral ligands
at the same time as they allow substrates and reagents to meet together in a chiral environment and then let the products dissociate so that the catalytic cycle can proceed. But in the
early years of the 21st century, several chemists around the world realized that it is not always
necessary to use a metal to initiate high levels of enantioselectivity in catalytic reactions.
Simple chiral and enantiomerically pure organic molecules, many of them amines, can also
react reversibly with substrates, providing a chiral environment and simultaneously activating them towards enantio selective attack.
Here is an example, which picks up where we left off: a catalytic enantioselective conjugate
addition. As you know from Chapter 11, aldehydes and ketones react with secondary amines
to form enamines, via iminium ions. But this unsaturated aldehyde can’t form an enamine
because the iminium ion that is generated by condensation with the cyclic secondary amine


-----

cannot lose a proton. The iminium ion is the end of the line for this condensation: it is very
reactive towards attack by water (which would reversibly regenerate starting materials), but
also towards attack by other nucleophiles. We have just what we want for good asymmetric
catalysis—an intermediate species that is reactive, chiral, and enantiomerically pure.

If this condensation is done in the presence of a weak nucleophile—strong enough to attack
the positively charged iminium ion but not strong enough to attack the aldehyde itself—an
addition reaction takes place. A pyrrole will do: pyrroles react well with cations. The phenyl
ring highlighted in green hangs over the front of the molecule so the pyrrole has no choice
but to attack diastereoselectively, from behind. The product is an enamine, which in the acid
conditions of the reaction is hydrolysed by the water generated in the initial condensation,
revealing the aldehyde in enantiomerically enriched form (93% ee) and regenerating the
secondary amine catalyst.

This catalyst and strategy were invented by the Glaswegian chemist David MacMillan at the
California Institute of Technology (now at Princeton in New Jersey) and given the name
‘organocatalysis’. Organocatalysis makes use of small organic molecules to achieve catalytic
asymmetric transformations, and can be distinguished from the more widespread methods of
catalysis which typically use metals. We’ll introduce another type of organocatalysis towards
the end of the chapter, but before we move on it’s worth looking at this amine catalyst and the
way it works in a little more detail.
The geminal dimethyl group highlighted in orange above is also important to the functioning of the catalyst. Without it, there is clearly a danger that the pyrrole will add directly to the
C=N bond of the iminium ion, a reaction that would kill the catalyst because the product is
an amine and not an enamine. The methyl groups on both faces of the iminium C=N bond
stop this happening. The other thing it ensures is the geometry of the iminium C=N bond.
This bond is trans so that the alkene can keep away from the quaternary carbon bearing the
two orange groups; the benzyl group with the green phenyl may be bigger in terms of total
number of atoms, but there is more space for the alkene on that side because the nearest carbon also carries just an H atom. Why is the geometry of the imine important? Well, if any of
it were cis, it would present the other face to the pyrrole and would be likely to give the opposite enantiomer of product.
Catalysts aren’t used in such great quantities as chiral auxiliaries, and so in general their
synthesis does not need to be quite so direct. Nonetheless as you can see from the examples
here, organocatalysts are still generally used in much greater quantities (10–20 mol%) than
some of the best metal catalysts. In this case you should be able to spot that the left-hand

portion of the cyclic amine is a derivative of L-phenylalanine. Condensation of its N-methyl

Here’s a related catalyst—as with the Rh- and Ru-catalysed reactions, fi ne tuning of the
catalyst is important—being used in the synthesis of an important pharmaceutical compound, a COX-2 inhibitor. This time the nucleophile is an indole reacting characteristically

###### Asymmetric aldol reactions


**Br**


You saw in Chapter 33 that it is possible to use aldol reactions to create two new chiral centres
in a single step, and that the relative stereochemistry of the two chiral centres depends in
many cases on the geometry of the enolate used to do the aldol reaction. The power of an
_asymmetric aldol reaction is easy to see: it creates two new chiral centres with control over_
their absolute stereochemistry, and also constructs a new C–C bond. What is more, the products of aldol reactions are very common features in a huge number of natural products known
as polyketides—as you will see in the next chapter, polyketides are made by living things
using a series of successive enzyme-controlled aldol reactions.

###### Chiral auxiliary-controlled aldol reactions: the Evans aldol

An aldol reaction is the addition of an enolate to an electrophile, where the electrophile is
an aldehyde or a ketone. You have already seen earlier in this chapter how enolates can be
used to make new C–C bonds enantioselectively when we explained how to control enolate
alkylation with Evans’ chiral auxiliaries. Evans’ auxiliaries also provide one of the most
straightforward ways of carrying out asymmetric aldol reactions, and we will start with an
example before explaining how asymmetric aldol reactions can be done using catalytic
methods.
This aldol reaction is carried out using a base (triethylamine) and dibutylboron trifl ate plus
benzaldehyde. The aldol product is formed with outstandingly good selectivity and in high
yield, and all that remains is to remove the auxiliary with base and isolate the hydroxy-acid
as a single diastereoisomer and a single enantiomer.

Aldol reactions using the lithium enolate of the acylated auxiliary shown here fail to give
good selectivities, so instead we use the boron enolate. The combination of triethylamine and
the boron trifl ate form the stable boron enolate, whch has to be cis because the size of the
auxiliary prevents the trans enolate forming. Boron has an empty p orbital, and donation into
this orbital from the oxygen of the carbonyl group stabilizes the enolate.

Now the aldehyde is added. If the reaction is to take place, the aldehyde must coordinate to
the boron because boron enolates aren’t reactive enough to attack aldehydes unless they are
activated by coordination to a Lewis acid. However, the aldehyde can’t simply coordinate to
the boron atom of the enolate because then the boron will end up with fi ve bonds, which is
impossible for a fi rst-row element. So, if the reaction is to continue, the boron has to let go of
the auxiliary’s carbonyl group and coordinate to the aldehyde instead.
At this stage something rather remarkable happens: now that the boron is no longer holding
the two oxygen atoms of the enolate close together, repulsion between them (they are both
electron-rich atoms) forces the auxiliary part of the enolate to swing round through 180° and
end up pointing in the opposite direction. This is highly signifi cant for what happens next
because you can see from the last structure in the scheme above that this rotation ends up
swinging the isopropyl group of the auxiliary round to the underside of the enolate and therefore forcing the auxiliary to react from the front instead of the back.
The diagrams below continue the story. The aldehyde has to attack the front face of the
auxiliary, but it also has to do so through what we termed in Chapter 33 a ‘Zimmerman–
Traxler transition state’—a six-membered, chair-like cyclic structure which allows the enolate
to attack the aldehyde while simultaneously transferring the metal (here the boron) from the
enolate oxygen to the new hydroxyl group.

All the usual advantages and disadvantages of chiral auxiliaries apply here: the products are
formed in very high selectivity and can be purifi ed to high ee, but the extra steps required to
introduce and remove the auxiliary may compromise the overall yield and effi ciency of the
reaction. Nonetheless, using this method and many others like it, it has now become possible
routinely to make polyketide natural products by successive aldol reactons, mimicking
nature’s approach to these compounds. In a spectacular demonstration of the power of synthetic chemistry to outperform natural sources, chemists at the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis made 60 g of the anticancer compound discodermolide by a synthetic route,
including fi ve aldol reactions. Four of these, shown by black C–C bonds in the structure
below, used the aldol or alkylation reactions controlled by Evans’ oxazolidinone chiral auxiliaries. To obtain the same quantity from the natural source, the sponge Discodermia, is impossible: the sponge produces minuscule amounts of discodermolide and can be harvested only
by using manned submersible vehicles, at some cost to the marine environment.

###### Aldol reactions catalysed by proline

A variety of catalytic ways of doing asymmetric aldol reactions have also been invented, but
space prevents us discussing all but one. This one we highlight fi rstly because it illustrates the
use of a supremely simple biologically derived compound to catalyse a complex reaction, and
secondly because this discovery was part of the revolution in catalytic thinking which
launched the fi eld of organocatalysis in the early years of the 21st century.
The catalyst we will use is the amino acid L-proline—no derivatization or protection required.
It was actually back in 1971 that it was fi rst noted that L-proline will catalyse asymmetric aldols,
but until the year 2000 examples were limited to this one cyclization. Treatment of a triketone
with proline leads to selective cyclization onto one of the two enantiotopic carbonyl groups. A
molecule of proline must condense with the least hindered ketone, and in this case an enamine
(rather than an iminium ion) can form. The chiral enamine can select to react with only one of
the two other carbonyl groups, and it turns out that it chooses with rather high selectivity the
one coloured green in the scheme below. Cyclization, in the manner of a Robinson annelation,
and hydrolysis of the resulting iminium ion follow on, releasing the molecule of L-proline to
start another catalytic cycle. The isolated product is the bicyclic ketone, in 93% ee.

This remained an oddity of a reaction until 2000, when chemists at the Scripps Institute in
California, and then others around the world, took the simple expedient of adding L-proline
to many other aldol reactions, with considerable success. With care, excellent results can be
obtained. Here is an example.

large excess

You will remember from Chapter 26 that crossed aldol reactions between enolizable partners, like these, usually need one of the reagents to be converted to an enolate equivalent to
ensure selective reaction. Here, the acetone is in excess, but the components are just stirred
together at room temperature in DMSO! The key to success is that one of the two components
must be more able to form a reactive enamine with proline than the other. In the case above,
the acetone-derived enamine is favoured because (1) enamine formation is reversible, (2) the
acetone is in excess, and (3) the enamine from acetone is less hindered and more reactive than
the enamine that would arise from the aldehyde.



- It has an odd name too: the
cyclization is sometimes called
the Hajos–Parrish–Eder–Sauer–
Wiechert reaction, after its
discoverers, but only by those
who want to impress their
friends.

In the aldol reaction itself, proline’s carboxyl group has a key role to play because it can
participate in a hydrogen bond that organizes the six-membered transition state in such a way
that only one of the possible enantiomeric products can form. The diagram below shows how.
Water generated in the initial condensation hydrolyses the iminium product of the aldol and
regenerates the proline catalyst.

Organocatalytic aldol reactions also work well with hydroxylated ketones—the reaction

the hydroxyl group has to be equatorial on the six-membered transition state. You should be
able to work out from this that the anti aldol has to form.

###### Enzymes as catalysts


**OH**

_anti aldol product_


We pointed out at the beginning of the chapter that all enantiomeric purity must ultimately
derive from nature. We have almost come full circle: the reactions we have just been looking
at use one of nature’s protein building blocks, L-proline, directly as a catalyst. Even more
intriguingly, the reaction just above, which forms a ketodiol, is extremely reminiscent of the
aldol reactions which nature uses to build carbohydrates, as you will see in the next chapter.
Yet nature does not use single amino acids to catalyse asymmetric reactions, it uses enzymes.
Enzymes are vastly more effi cient than L-proline and catalyse a much wider range of reactions, but while they are also much more complicated, their reactivity derives ultimately from
the amino acids they are made up of.
Life uses enzymes to catalyse asymmetric reactions, so the question is—can chemists? The
answer is yes, and there are many enzymes that can be produced in quantities large enough
to be used in the catalytic synthesis of enantiomerically pure molecules. This fi eld—known as
biocatalysis—melds ideas in chemistry and biology, and we do not have the space here to
discuss it in detail. We leave you with just one example: the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol with an enzyme known as a ketoreductase.

substrate—benzoyloxyacetone—before, but the reaction works. In fact this sort of reaction

Many other groups of enzymes behave similarly: they have evolved to take part in particular biochemical pathways, but they are suffi ciently promiscuous that they will happily accept
alternative substrates and provide chemically useful products from them. Enzymes are catalysts, like any other. In the next chapter, we take a more detailed look at those biochemical
pathways and discuss the organic chemistry of life.

Humans produce neither of
these, but we do make steroids,
as do other animals (and a few
plants). All of these molecules
are the products of secondary
metabolism.

###### Primary metabolism

Life runs on chemistry, and the chemical side of biology is fascinating for that reason alone.
It is humbling to realize that the same molecules are present in all living things, from the
simplest single-cell creatures to ourselves. Nucleic acids contain the genetic information of
every organism, and they control the synthesis of proteins. Proteins are partly structural—as
in connective tissue—and partly functional—as in enzymes, the catalysts for biological reactions. Sugars and lipids used to be thought of as the poor relations of the other two, storing
energy and building membranes, but it is now clear that they also have a vital part to play in
recognition and transport.
The chemistry common to all living things is known as primary metabolism and the chart
overleaf shows the molecules of primary metabolism and the connections between them, and
needs some explanation. It shows a simplifi ed relationship between the key structures
(emphasized in large black type). It shows their origins—from CO2 in the fi rst instance—and
picks out some important intermediates. Glucose, pyruvic acid, citric acid, acetyl coenzyme A
(acetyl CoA), and ribose are players on the centre stage of metabolism and are built into many

###### Life begins with nucleic acids

Nucleic acids store genetic information. They are polymers whose building blocks (monomers) are the nucleotides, themselves made of three parts—a heterocyclic base, a sugar, and a
phosphate ester. In the example below, adenine is the base (shown in black), adenosine is the
nucleoside (base and sugar), and the nucleotide is the whole molecule (base + sugar + phosphate). This nucleotide is called AMP—adenosine monophosphate. Phosphates are key compounds in nature because they form useful stable linkages between molecules and can also be
built up into reactive molecules by simply multiplying the number of phosphate residues. The
most important of these nucleotides is also one of the most important molecules in nature—
adenosine triphosphate or ATP.


###### Nucleosides and nucleotides

A nucleoside differs from a
nucleotide in lacking the
phosphate—a nucleoside is
just a base and a sugar.

- You met pyrimidines in
Chapter 29 and learned how to
make them in Chapter 30, but
the purine ring system may be
new to you. Make sure you can
fi nd the six (or ten) electrons
making these compounds
aromatic. You may need to draw
delocalized structures, especially
for U, T, and G.


ATP is a highly reactive molecule because phosphates are stable anions and good leaving
groups. It can be attacked by hard nucleophiles at a phosphate group (usually the end one) or
by soft nucleophiles at the CH2 group on the sugar. When a new reaction is initiated in nature,
very often the fi rst step is a reaction with ATP to make the compound more reactive. This is
rather like our use of TsCl to make alcohols more reactive or converting acids to acid chlorides
to make them more reactive.

###### There are fi ve heterocyclic bases in DNA and RNA

Nucleic acids are made up of a selection of fi ve bases, two sugars, and the phosphate group.
The bases are monocyclic pyrimidines or bicyclic purines and are all aromatic.

 - There are only two purine bases found in nucleic acids: adenine (A), which we have
already met, and guanine (G)

 - The three pyrimidine bases are simpler: uracil (U), thymine (T), and cytosine (C).
Cytosine is found in DNA and RNA, uracil in RNA only, and thymine in DNA only.

The coloured parts of the molecules below emphasize the characteristic features of the bases.

###### The stimulants in tea and coffee are methylated purines

An important stimulant for many is a fully methylated purine present in tea and coffee—
caffeine. Caffeine is a crystalline substance easily extracted from coffee or tea with organic
solvents. It is extracted industrially with supercritical CO2 (or, if you prefer, ‘nature’s effervescence’) to make decaffeinated tea and coffee.
If we, as chemists, were to add those methyl groups we would choose to use a reagent such
as methyl iodide, but nature uses a much more complicated molecule. There is a great deal of
methylating going on in living things—and the methyl groups are usually added by
(S)-adenosyl methionine (or SAM), formed by reaction of methionine with ATP. This is a good
reaction because sulfur is a good soft nucleophile, triphosphate is a good leaving group, and
substitution at primary carbon is easy.

SAM is a sulfonium salt and could be attacked by nucleophiles at three different carbon
atoms. Two are primary centres—good for SN2 reactions—but the third is the methyl group,
which is even better. Many nucleophiles attack SAM in this way. In the coffee plant, theobromine (a purine also found in cocoa) is converted into caffeine with a molecule of SAM. The
methylation occurs on nitrogen partly because this preserves both the aromatic ring and the
amide functionality and also because the enzyme involved brings the two molecules together
in the right orientation for N-methylation.

At this point we should just point out something that it’s easy to forget: there is only one
_chemistry. There is no magic in biological chemistry, and nature uses the same chemical princi-_
ples as we do in the chemical laboratory. All the mechanisms that you have studied so far will
help you to draw mechanisms for biological reactions and most reactions that you have met
have their counterparts in nature. The difference is that nature is very, very good at chemistry,
and we humans are only just learning. We still do much more sophisticated reactions inside our
bodies without thinking about them than we can do outside our bodies with all the most powerful ideas available to us in the 21st century.

One of the most important discoveries of modern science was the elucidation of the structures of DNA and RNA as the famous double helix
by Watson and Crick in 1953. They realized that the basic structure of
base–sugar–phosphate was ideal for a three-dimensional coil. The
structure of a small part of DNA is shown on the right. Notice that the
2′ (pronounced ‘two prime’) position on the ribose ring is vacant.
There is no hydroxyl group there: that is why it is called deoxyribonucleic acid. The nucleotides link the two remaining OH groups on the
ribose ring and these are called the 3′- and 5′-positions. This piece of
DNA has three nucleotides (adenine, adenine, and thymine) and so
would be called –AAT– for short.


link to next
nucleotide


Each polymeric strand of DNA coils up into a helix and is bonded to another strand by
hydrogen bonds between the bases. Each base pairs up specifi cally with another base—
adenine with thymine (A–T) and guanine with cytosine (G–C)—like this.

There is quite a lot to notice about these structures. Each purine (A or G) is bonded specifi cally to one pyrimidine (T or C) by two or by three hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonds are
of two kinds: one links an amine to a carbonyl group (black in the diagram) and one links an
amine to an imine (green in the diagram). A purine has to pair with a pyrimidine because
only the combination of larger purine and smaller pyrimidine bridges the gap between the
nucleic acid coils. Look back at the green and orange parts of the structures on p. 1136 and you
will see that only one hydrogen bond pairing pattern can work. In this way, each nucleotide
reliably recognizes another and reliably pairs with its partner. The short strand of DNA above
(–AAT–) would pair reliably with –TTA–.

###### HIV and AIDS are treated with modifi ed nucleosides

Modifi ed nucleosides are among the best antiviral compounds. The anti-HIV drug AZT (zidovudine) is a slightly modifi ed DNA nucleoside (3′-azidothymidine). It has an azide at C3′ instead of
the hydroxyl group in the natural nucleoside. A more radically modifi ed nucleoside 3-TC (lamivudine) is active against AZT-resistant viruses. This drug is based on cytosine with the sugar
replaced by a different heterocycle, although it is recognizably similar, especially in the stereochemistry. Acyclovir (Zovirax), the cold sore (herpes) treatment, is a modifi ed guanosine in
which only a ghost of the sugar remains. There is no ring at all and no stereochemistry.

###### Cyclic nucleosides and stereochemistry

DNA is more stable than RNA because its sugars lack the 2′ hydroxyl groups. In ribonucleic
acids, the fact that the 2′- and 3′-OH groups are on the same side of the ring makes alkaline
hydrolysis exceptionally rapid by intramolecular nucleophilic catalysis.

The base removes a proton from the 2′-OH group, which cyclizes on to the phosphate link—
possible only if the ring fusion is _cis. The next reaction involves breakdown of the penta-_
covalent phosphorus intermediate to give a cyclic phosphate. One nucleoside is released by
this reaction and the second follows when the cyclic phosphate is itself cleaved by base.
Another cyclic phosphate that can be formed from a nucleotide is important as a biological
messenger that helps to control such processes as blood clotting and acid secretion in the
stomach. It is cyclic AMP (cAMP), formed enzymatically from ATP by nucleophilic displacement of pyrophosphate by the 3′-OH group.

###### Proteins are made of amino acids

DNA encodes the information needed to make proteins in the form of triplets of bases
(codons), for example thymine–adenine–cytosine (TAC) in the diagram below. As RNA is
synthesized from DNA, these are turned into complementary codons (in the example below,
AUG) by pairing up the bases as shown on p. 1138. This RNA forms the instructions for protein synthesis by the ribosome—perhaps the most elaborate molecular structure in the known
universe. Each codon of the RNA chain tells the ribosome to add a specifi c amino acid to the
growing protein. For example, the codon AUG indicates methionine, which we met as a component of SAM. Methionine is a typical amino acid of the kind present in proteins, but is also
the starter unit of all proteins.

###### Amino acids combine to form peptides and proteins

In nature, the amino acids are combined to give proteins with hundreds or even thousands of
amino acids in each one. Small assemblies of amino acids are known as peptides and the
amide bond that links them is called a peptide bond.
An important tripeptide is glutathione, present in the tissues of both animals and plants.
Glutathione is the ‘universal thiol’ that removes dangerous oxidizing agents by allowing itself
to be oxidized to a disulfi de. Glutathione is, however, not quite a typical tripeptide. The lefthand amino acid is normal glutamic acid but it is joined to the next amino acid through its
γ-CO2H group instead of the more normal α-CO2H group. The middle amino acid is the vital
one for the function—cysteine with a free SH group. The C-terminal acid is glycine.

Glutathione also detoxifi es some of the compounds we described earlier in this book as

as a nucleophile, inactivating the electrophiles. Covalently bound to glutathione they are
harmless and can be excreted. More glutathione will be synthesized from glutamic acid,
cysteine, and glycine to replace that which is lost.

angiotensin I

no effect on blood pressure


Some short peptides, of around ten amino acids, are hormones. Angiotensin II, for example,
is a peptide that causes blood pressure to rise—a very necessary thing in some situations but
too much and too often leads to heart attacks and strokes.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is the zinc-dependent enzyme that cleaves two amino
acids from the end of angiotensin I to give angiotensin II, and ACE inhibitors are used as treatment for high blood pressure because they inhibit this enzyme. Lisinopril is an example: it is a
dipeptide mimic, having two natural amino acids and something else. The ‘something else’ is
the left-hand part of the molecule, linked to the dipeptide (Lys–Pro) through an amine and not

by an amide bond. This stops enzymes from hydrolysing the molecule. Lisinopril binds to ACE
because it is like a natural dipeptide but it inhibits it because it is not a natural dipeptide. Many
people are alive today because of this simple deception practised on an enzyme.

###### Structural proteins must be tough and fl exible

In contrast with the functional enzymes, proteins such as collagen are purely structural.
Collagen is the tough protein of tendons and connective tissue, and is present in skin, bone,
and teeth. It contains large amounts of glycine (every third amino acid is glycine), proline,
and hydroxyproline (again about a third of the amino acids are either Pro or Hyp).
Hydroxyproline is a specialized amino acid that appears almost nowhere else and, along
with proline, it establishes a very strong triply coiled structure for collagen. The glycine is
necessary as there is no room in the triple coil for any larger amino acid. Functionalized
amino acids are rare in collagen.

###### Hydroxyproline and scurvy

Hydroxyproline is a very unusual amino acid. It is not incorporated into the growing protein chain when collagen is
synthesized—instead the collagen molecule is assembled with Pro where Hyp is need. Once the protein is complete,
some of the proline residues are oxidized to hydroxyproline. This oxidation requires vitamin C, and without it collagen
cannot be formed. This is why vitamin C defi ciency causes scurvy—the symptoms of scurvy suffered by 18th-century
sailors (loose teeth, sores, and blisters) were caused by the inability to make collagen.

###### Antiobiotics exploit the special chemistry of bacteria

We have repeatedly emphasized that all life has very similar chemistry. From the biochemical
point of view the most important division is that separating _prokaryotes from_ _eukaryotes._
Prokaryotes, which include bacteria, evolved fi rst and have simple cells with no nucleus.
Eukaryotes, which include plants, mammals, and all other multicellular creatures, evolved
later and have more complex cells, including nuclei. Even then, much of the biochemistry on
both sides of the divide is the same.
When medicinal chemists are looking for ways to attack bacteria, one approach is to interfere with chemistry carried out by prokaryotes but not by us. The most famous of these attacks
is aimed at the construction of the cell walls of some bacteria that contain ‘unnatural’ (R)- (or

D-) amino acids. Bacterial cell walls are made from glycopeptides of an unusual kind.
Polysaccharide chains are cross-linked with short peptides containing (R)-alanine (D-Ala).
Before they are linked up, one chain ends with a glycine molecule and the other with D-Ala–

D-Ala. In the fi nal step in the cell wall synthesis, the glycine attacks the D-Ala–D-Ala sequence
to form a new peptide bond by displacing one D-Ala residue.



- The reason bacteria have
evolved to use these ‘unnatural’

D-amino acids in their cell walls
is to protect them against the
enzymes in animals and plants,
which cannot digest proteins
containing D-amino acids.

β-lactam in black


The antibiotic penicillin works by interfering with this step—although this was not even
suspected when penicillin was discovered. Penicillin inhibits the enzyme that catalyses the

D-Ala transfer in a very specifi c way. It fi rst binds specifi cally to the enzyme (so it must be a
mimic of the natural substrate) and it then reacts with the enzyme and inactivates it by blocking a vital OH group at the active site. If we emphasize the peptide nature of penicillin and
compare it with D-Ala–D-Ala, the mimicry may become clearer.

Penicillin imitates D-Ala and binds to the active site of the enzyme, encouraging the OH
group of a serine residue to attack the reactive strained β-lactam. This same OH group of the
same serine residue would normally be the catalyst for the D-Ala–D-Ala cleavage used in the
building of the bacterial cell wall. The reaction with penicillin ‘protects’ the serine and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme. The bacterial cell walls cannot be completed, and the bacterial
cells literally burst under the pressure of their contents. Penicillin does not kill bacteria whose
cell walls are already complete but it does prevent new bacteria being formed.

###### Sugars—just energy sources?

Sugars are the building blocks of carbohydrates. They used to be thought of as essential but rather
dull molecules whose function was principally the (admittedly useful) storage of energy. In fact
they have much more interesting and varied roles than that. We have already noted that ribose
plays an intimate role in DNA and RNA structure and function. Sugars are also often found in
intimate association with proteins and are involved in recognition and adhesion processes.
Here are two examples. How does a sperm recognize the egg and penetrate its wall?
Recognition of a carbohydrate attached to the membrane of the egg was the fi rst event in all
of our lives. And how does a virus get inside a cell? Here again, the recognition process involves
specifi c carbohydrates. One of the ways in which AIDS is being tackled with some success is
by a combination of the antiviral drugs we met earlier in this chapter with HIV protease
inhibitor drugs, which aim to prevent recognition and penetration of cells by HIV.

###### Sugars normally exist in cyclic forms with much stereochemistry

The most important sugar is glucose. It has a saturated six-membered ring containing oxygen
and it is best drawn in a chair conformation with nearly all the substituents equatorial. It can
also be drawn as a fl at confi gurational diagram. We have already met one sugar in this chapter, ribose, because it was part of the structure of nucleic acids. This sugar is a fi ve-membered
saturated oxygen heterocycle with many OH groups. Indeed, you can defi ne a sugar as
an oxygen heterocycle with every carbon atom bearing an oxygen-based functional group—
usually OH, but alternatively C=O.

The drawings of glucose and ribose show a number of stereogenic centres, with one centre
undefi ned—an OH group shown with a wavy bond. This is because one centre in both sugars
is a hemiacetal and therefore the molecule is in equilibrium with an open-chain hydroxyaldehyde. For glucose, the open-chain form is this.

When the ring closes again, any of the OH groups could cyclize on to the aldehyde but there
is no real competition—the six-membered ring is more stable than any of the alternatives
(which could have three-, four-, fi ve-, or seven-membered rings—check for yourself). However,
with ribose there is a reasonable alternative.

ribo-furanose open-chain (aldehyde) form ribo-pyranose

The most important sugars may exist in an open-chain form, as a fi ve-membered oxygen
heterocycle (called a furanose, after the fi ve-membered aromatic compound furan) or a sixmembered oxygen heterocycle (called a pyranose, after the six-membered pyran). Glucose prefers the pyranose structure; ribose prefers the furanose structure.

###### Sugars can be fi xed in one shape by acetal formation

The simplest way to fi x glucose in the pyranose form is to trap it as an acetal. Acid-catalysed
condensation with an alcohol, methanol, for example, gives an acetal and, remarkably, the
acetal has an axial OR group. Acetal formation is under thermodynamic control (Chapter 11)
so the axial compound must be the more stable. This is because of the anomeric effect—socalled because this C atom is called the anomeric position and the acetal diastereoisomers are
called anomers. The effect is a bonding interaction between the axial lone pair on the oxygen
atom in the ring and the σ* orbital of the OMe group.

The formation of acetals allows a remarkable degree of control over the chemistry of sugars.
Apart from the simple glucoside acetal we have just seen, there are three important acetals
worth understanding because of the way in which they illustrate stereoelectronic effects—the
interplay of stereochemistry and mechanism. If we make an acetal from methyl glucoside and
benzaldehyde, we get a single compound as a single stereoisomer.

The new acetal could have been formed between any of the adjacent OH groups in the starting material but it chose the only pair (the black OH groups) which give a six-membered ring.
The stereochemistry of glucose is such that the new six-membered ring is trans-fused to the
old so that a beautifully stable all-chair bicyclic structure results, with the phenyl group in an
equatorial position in the new chair acetal ring. Acetal formation is under thermodynamic
control and this product is the most stable possible acetal.
Acetal formation from sugars and acetone shows quite different selectivity. For a start, cyclic
acetals of acetone prefer to be fi ve- rather than six-membered rings. In a six-membered ring,
one of the acetone’s methyl groups would have to be axial, so the fi ve-membered ring is preferred. A 5,5 or 5,6 ring fusion is more stable if it is cis, and so acetone acetals (acetonides) form
preferentially from cis 1,2-diols. Glucose has no neighbouring cis hydroxyls in the pyranose
form, but in the furanose form it can have two pairs. Formation of an acetal with acetone fi xes
glucose in the furanose form. This is all summarized in the scheme below.

- The most important
N-glycosides are, of course, the
nucleotides, which we have
already described in some detail.


The open-chain form of glucose is in equilibrium with both the pyranose and the furanose
forms through reversible hemiacetal formation using the black and green OH groups, respectively. Normally, the pyranose form is preferred, but the furanose form can form a double
acetal with acetone, one acetal having two cis-fused fi ve-membered rings and the other being
on the side chain. This double acetal is the product isolated from the reaction.
If we want to fi x glucose in the open-chain form, we must make an ‘acetal’ of quite a different kind using a thiol (RSH) instead of an alcohol, an aldehyde, or a ketone. The thiol combines with the aldehyde group of the open-chain form to give a stable dithioacetal. The
dithioacetal is evidently more stable than the alternative hemiacetals or monothioacetals that
could be formed from the pyranose or furanose forms.

###### Glycosides in nature

Many alcohols, thiols, and amines occur in nature as glycosides, that is as O-, S-, or N-acetals
at the anomeric position of glucose. The purpose of attaching these compounds to glucose is
often to improve solubility or transport across membranes—to expel a toxin from the cell, for
example. Sometimes glucose is attached in order to stabilize the compound so that glucose
appears as nature’s protecting group, rather as a chemist might use a THP group (Chapter 23).

_O-Glycosides occur in immense variety with glucose and other sugars being joined to the_
OH groups of alcohols and phenols to form acetals. The stereochemistry of these compounds
is usually described by the Greek letters α and β. If the OR bond is down, it’s an α-glycoside; if
up, a β-glycoside. An attractive example is the pigment of red roses, which is an interesting
aromatic oxygen heterocycle (an anthocyanidin). Two of the phenolic OH groups are present
as β-glycosides.


###### α- and β-glycosides

It is easy to remember which is
which, as long as you accept
that people who devise nomenclature must be maliciously foolish. Just as E means trans and Z
means cis (each letter has the

α means below and β means

It’s often proposed that there are special benefi ts to health in eating broccoli and brussels sprouts because of the sulfur-containing antioxidants they contain. These compounds
are unstable isothiocyanates. They are not usually present in the plant; damage—by cutting or cooking, for example—induces a glycosidase (an enzyme which hydrolyses glycosides) to releases the sulfur compound from its glucose protection. A simple example is
sinigrin. The S-glycosides of the sinigrin group start to hydrolyse in the same way. The
sulfur atom is the better leaving group when it leaves as an anion (though worse than
oxygen when the hydrolysis occurs in acidic conditions) and the anion is additionally
stabilized by conjugation.

The next step is surprising. A rearrangement occurs, rather similar to the Beckmann
re arrangement, in which the alkyl group migrates from carbon to nitrogen and an isothiocyanate (R–N=C=S) is formed. Sinigrin occurs in mustard and horseradish, and it is the
release of the allyl isothiocyanate that gives these their ‘hot’ taste. When mustard powder is
mixed with water, the hot taste develops over some minutes as sinigrin is hydrolysed to the
isothiocyanate.
The S-glycoside in broccoli and brussels sprouts that is proposed to offer protection from
cancer is somewhat similar but has one more carbon atom in the chain and contains a sulfoxide group as well. Hydrolysis of the S-glycoside is followed by the same rearrangement, producing a molecule called sulforaphane. Sulforaphane protects against cancer-causing oxidants
by inducing the formation of a reductive enzyme.

###### Most sugars are embedded in complex carbohydrates

The most familiar of all sugars is sucrose—the mixed acetal formed from glucose and fructose.
Sucrose is of course sweet, and is easily metabolized into fats. But if three of the OH groups in
sucrose are replaced by chlorine atoms, a compound 600 times as sweet is produced: less of it
is needed to get the same sweet taste and the chlorines reduce the rate of metabolism so that
much less fat is made. This is the compound sucralose, discovered by chemists at Tate & Lyle
and now used to sweeten soft drinks.

10[15] kg per year of cellulose is
literally an astronomical amount:
it’s about the mass of one of the
moons of Mars, Deimos. Our
moon weighs 10[22] kg.


Sucrose is a disaccharide—two simple sugars linked by an acetal. In general, saccharides
have the same relationship to sugars as peptides and proteins have to amino acids. One of the
most abundant compounds in nature is a saccharide: cellulose, the structural material of
plants. It is a glucose polymer and is produced in simply enormous quantities (about 10[15] kg
per year). Each glucose molecule is joined to the next through an acetal formed by attack of
the C4 hydroxyl group of one glucose molecule on the anomeric carbon atom of the next.
Here is that basic arrangement.

Notice that the anomeric bonds are all equatorial. This means that the cellulose molecule is

The polymer is also coiled to increase stability still further. All this makes cellulose very
diffi cult to hydrolyse, and humans cannot digest cellulose as we do not have the necessary
enzymes. Other mammals have evolved devices such as multiple stomachs (in ruminants,
such as cattle) to enable them to degrade cellulose.

###### Amino sugars add versatility to saccharides

Amino sugars are carbohydrates into which nitrogen is incorporated. These molecules
allow proteins and sugars to combine and produce structures of remarkable variety and
beauty. The most common amino sugars are N-acetyl glucosamine and N-acetyl galactosamine, which differ only in stereochemistry. The hard outer skeletons of insects and crustaceans contain chitin, a polymer very like cellulose but made of acetyl glucosamine instead
of glucose itself. It coils up in a similar way and provides the toughness of crab shells and
beetle cases.

Cell membranes must not be so impermeable as they need to allow the passage of water
and complex molecules. These membranes contain _glycoproteins—proteins with amino_
sugar residues attached to asparagine, serine, or threonine in the protein. The attachment is
at the anomeric position so that these compounds are O- or N-glycosides of the amino sugars. The structure below shows N-acetyl galactosamine attached to an asparagine residue as
an N-glycoside.

###### Lipids

Lipids (fats) are the principal components of cell membranes. Along with cholesterol, also a
component of the cell membrane, they have acquired a bad name, but they are nonetheless
essential to the function of membranes as selective barriers to the movement of molecules.
The most common types of lipids are esters of glycerol. Glycerol is just propane-1,2,3-triol
but it has interesting stereochemistry. It is not chiral as it has a plane of symmetry, but the
two primary OH groups are enantiotopic. If one of them is modifi ed—by esterifi cation, for

example—the molecule becomes chiral. Natural glycerol 3-phosphate is such an ester and it
is optically active.
A typical lipid in foodstuffs is the triester formed from glycerol and oleic acid, which is the
most abundant lipid in olive oil. Oleic acid is a mono-unsaturated fatty acid—it has one _Z_
double bond in the middle of the C18 chain. This bond gives the molecule a marked kink in the
middle. The compound actually present in olive oil is the triester, also kinked.

###### Oil and water do not mix

The lipid has, more or less, the conformation shown in the diagram with all the polar ester
groups at one end and the hydrocarbon chains bunched together in a non-polar region. Oil
and water do not mix, it is said, but triglyceride lipids associate with water in a special way. A
drop of oil spreads out on water in a very thin layer. It does so because the ester groups sit
inside the water and the hydrocarbon side chains stick out of the water and associate with
each other.

###### Mechanisms in biological chemistry

Nature uses the same chemistry as we do in the laboratory, and to do that chemistry she needs
reagents. Chemists are free to use temperatures typically ranging 100 °C either side of 20 °C, any
solvents they choose, inert or reactive atmospheres, and so on. Not so nature: all nature’s reagents must work at ambient temperature in the presence of water and in the presence of a reactive gas, oxygen. In this section we will survey some of nature’s solutions to these challenges.

###### Nature’s NaBH4 is a nucleotide: NADH or NADPH

You met nucleotides, and their role in the structure of nucleic acids, earlier in this chapter.
Nature also uses nucleotides as reagents. Here is the structure of AMP, just to remind you of a
structure you met before, side by side with a pyridine-containing nucleotide.

These two nucleotides can combine together as a pyrophosphate to give a dinucleotide called
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD (or NAD[+]—note the positively charged pyridinium). Notice that the link is not at all the same as in the nucleic acids. The latter are joined by
one phosphate that links the 3′ and 5′ positions. Here we have a pyrophosphate link between
the two 5′ positions.

The positively charged pyridinium ring is the part of the molecule which does all the work
and from now on we will draw only the reactive part for clarity. NAD[+] is one of nature’s most
important oxidizing agents. Some biochemical pathway reactions use NADP instead, but this
differs only in having an extra phosphate group on the adenosine portion so the same part
structure will do for both. NAD[+] and NADP both work by accepting a hydrogen atom and a
pair of electrons from another compound. The reduced compounds are called NADH and
NADPH.

The names of enzymes are usually chosen to tell us where they

addition) of hydrogen.

The reduction of NAD[+] (and NADP) is reversible, and NADH is itself a reducing agent. We
will fi rst look at one of its reactions: a typical reduction of a ketone. The ketone is pyruvic acid
and the reduction product is lactic acid—both important metabolites. The reaction is catalysed by an alcohol dehydrogenase.

This is a reaction that would also work in the laboratory with NaBH4 as the reducing agent,
but there is a big difference. The product from the NaBH4 reaction must be racemic—the starting material, reagent, and solvent are all achiral.

are not clear about the terms
‘enantiotopic’ and ‘prochiral’
re-read Chapters 31 and 33. If you
are not clear about what
enantiomers are, you must re-read
Chapter 14 now.


But the product from the enzymatic reaction is optically active. The two faces of pyruvic
acid’s carbonyl group are enantiotopic and, by controlling the addition so that it occurs from
one face only, the enzyme-catalysed reaction gives a single enantiomer of lactic acid.

###### Reductive amination in nature

One of the best methods for making amines in the laboratory is reductive amination, in
which an imine (formed from a carbonyl compound and an amine) is reduced to a saturated
amine. Common reducing agents include NaCNBH3 and hydrogen with a catalyst.

This reaction, of course, produces racemic amines. But nature transforms this simple reaction into an enantioselective and reversible one that is beautiful in its simplicity. The reagents
are a pair of substituted pyridines called pyridoxamine and pyridoxal, and the enzyme is an
aminotransferase.

The mechanism of the amination starts with the formation of an imine from the black
amino group and the green carbonyl. Removal of the now very acidic proton between the
protonated pyridine and the conjugated imino-carboxylic acid gives a dihydropyridine,
which rearomatizes by protonation next to the carboxylic acid. This step is enantioselective,
with the proton being delivered from the enzyme. Finally, hydrolysis of the new imine gives
pyridoxal and a single enantiomer of the amino acid.

###### Nature’s enolate equivalents: lysine enamines and coenzyme A

Nature breaks down glucose to produce energy, and in doing so produces smaller molecules
which enter the citric acid cycle and are converted ultimately to carbon dioxide. In the other
direction, the six-carbon sugar fructose can be made from two three-carbon fragments. The
key reaction in both cases is the step in which the C–C bond linking the two C3 sugars is
formed or broken. The C3 sugars are glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone, both as their
phosphate esters, and the reaction between then is an aldol condensation. The enol of dihydr o xyacetone phosphate attacks the electrophilic aldehyde carbonyl group of glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate, catalysed by an enzyme named aldolase. The product is a ketohexose (i.e. a sixcarbon sugar with a ketone carbonyl group), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.

Proton transfers allow this imine to be converted into an enamine, which acts as the nucleophile in the aldol reaction. Stereochemical control (it’s a syn aldol) comes from the way in
which the two molecules are held by the enzyme as they combine. The product is the imine,
which is hydrolysed to the open-chain form of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.

Many other reactions in nature use enamines, mostly those formed from lysine. However, a
more common enol equivalent is based on thiol esters derived from coenzyme A. Coenzyme A
is an adenine nucleotide at one end, linked by a 5′-pyrophosphate to pantothenic acid, a compound that looks rather like a tripeptide, and then to an amino thiol. Here is the structure
broken down into its parts.


**NH2**

**N**



- Compare this structure with
that of NAD—the adenine
nucleotide is the same, as is the
5′- pyrophosphate link. The
difference is at the other end of
that link where we fi nd this
new tripeptide-like molecule
and not another nucleotide.
There is also a 3′-phosphate on
the ribose ring not present in
NAD (and note that while NADP
contains a phosphorylated
ribose, its phosphate is on the
2′ hydroxyl group!).


By now you will realize that most of this molecule is there to allow interaction with the various enzymes that catalyse the reactions of coenzyme A. Coenzyme A is conveniently abbreviated in structures to CoASH, where the SH is the vital thiol functional group, and all the


the business end pantothenic acid pyrophosphate adenine
of CoA—a thiol

reactions we will be interested in are those of esters of CoASH. These are thiol esters, as opposed
to normal alcohol esters, and the difference is worth a few comments.
Thiol esters are less conjugated than ordinary esters, and ester hydrolysis occurs more rapidly with thiol esters than with ordinary esters because in the rate-determining step (nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group) there is less conjugation to destroy. The thiolate is also a
better leaving group.

Another reaction that goes better with thiol esters than with ordinary esters is enolization.
This is an equilibrium reaction and the enol has lost the conjugation present in the ester.
Again, a thiol ester has less to lose so is more enolized, and it is the enolization of thiolesters
of coenzyme A that we are now going to discuss.
We mentioned the citric acid cycle earlier but we have not so far discussed the chemistry
involved. The citric acid cycle allows metabolism to shunt carbon atoms between small molecules, and the key step is the synthesis of citric acid from oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA. The
reaction is essentially an aldol reaction between the enol of an acetate ester and an electrophilic ketone, and the enzyme which catalyses the reaction is known as citrate synthase.

The mechanism shows the enol of acetyl CoA attacking the reactive ketone. In nature all
these reactions are catalysed by the enzyme. In the C–C bond-forming step, one histidine residue removes the enol proton and another histidine, in its protonated form, is placed to donate
a proton to the oxygen atom of the ketone. You should see now why histidine is so useful to
enzymes: its imidazole ring means it can act either as an acid or as a base at neutral pH.

Even the hydrolysis of the reactive thiol ester is catalysed by the enzyme and histidine again
functions as a proton donor, with the hydrolysis, like the enolization, being enhanced by the
thiol ester.
The two enol equivalents that we have met so far are quite general: lysine enamines can be
used for any aldehyde or ketone and CoA thiol esters for any ester. Another class of enol
equivalent—the enol ester—has just one representative but it is a most important one.

###### Phosphoenolpyruvate

Pyruvic acid is an important metabolite in its own right, as we shall see shortly. It is the simplest
α-keto-acid (2-oxopropanoic acid). Having the two carbonyl groups adjacent makes them more
reactive: the ketone is more electrophilic and enolizes more readily, and the acid is stronger.
Nature uses the enol phosphate of pyruvic acid (phosphoenolpyruvate or PEP) as an important reagent. We might imagine making this compound by fi rst forming the enol and then
esterifying on oxygen by some phosphorylating agent such as ATP.

Now, in fact, this reaction does occur in nature as part of the glycolysis pathway, but it occurs
almost entirely in reverse. PEP is used as a way to make ATP from ADP during the oxidation of
energy-storing sugars. An enol is a better leaving group than an ordinary alcohol, especially if
it can be protonated at carbon. The reverse reaction might look like this.

PEP is also used as an enol in the making of carbon–carbon bonds when the electrophile is

answer is by dehydration. The phosphate is already in place when the dehydration occurs,
catalysed by the enzyme enolase.

You saw in Chapter 17 how simple OH groups can be lost in dehydration reactions. Either
the OH group was protonated by strong acid (this is not an option in living things) or an
enol or enolate pushed the OH group out in an E1cB-like mechanism. This must be the case
here as the better leaving group (phosphate) is ignored and the worse leaving group (OH)
expelled.

###### The shikimic acid pathway

The shikimic acid pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of a large number of aromatic
compounds, particularly in plants. Most important for many mammals is the fact that plants
manufacture the aromatic amino acids Phe (phenylalanine), Tyr (tyrosine), and Trp (tryptophan). These are ‘essential’ amino acids for humans—we have to have them in our diet as we
cannot make them ourselves.
So how do plants make aromatic rings? A clue to the chemistry involved comes from the
structure of caffeyl quinic acid, a compound that forms about 13% of the soluble solids from
coffee beans. A substantial proportion of instant coffee is caffeyl quinic acid.

This ester has two six-membered rings—one aromatic and one saturated. You might
imagine making an aromatic ring by the dehydration (losing three molecules of water)
of a cyclohexane triol and the saturated ring in caffeyl quinic acid looks a good candidate.
It is now known that both rings (shown in black) come from the same intermediate,
shikimic acid.
This key intermediate has given its name to nature’s general route to aromatic compounds
and many other related six-membered ring compounds: the shikimic acid pathway. This pathway contains some of the most interesting reactions (from a chemist’s point of view) in biology. It starts with an aldol reaction between phosphoenol pyruvate as the nucleophilic enol
component and the C4 sugar erythrose 4-phosphate as the electrophilic aldehyde.

Hydrolysis of the phosphate releases the aldol product, a C7 α-keto-acid with one new stereogenic centre, which is in equilibrium with a hemiacetal, just like a sugar. This intermediate
has the right number of carbon atoms for shikimic acid and the next stage is a cyclization. If
we redraw the uncyclized C7 α-keto-acid in the right shape for cyclization we can see what is
needed. The green arrow shows which bond needs to be formed. This bond could be formed
by another aldol reaction, and there is an obvious route to the required enol by elimination
of phosphate. However, this would require the removal of a proton (green in the diagram) that
is not at all acidic.

The problem can be avoided if the hydroxyl group at C5 is fi rst oxidized to a ketone (using
NAD[+] as the oxidant). Then the green proton is much more acidic, and the elimination
becomes an E1cB reaction, similar to the one in the synthesis of PEP. True, the ketone must be
reduced back to the alcohol afterwards but nature can deal with that easily. There are obviously several more steps to get to shikimic acid but all the C–C bonds are in place, the most
signifi cant of them being formed by aldol reactions.

###### Natural products


Organic chemists mean something particular by the phrase ‘natural products’. Of course, all
the compounds we have so far discussed are natural and their chemistry is common to most
living things. But living things also make chemicals by the processes of secondary metabolism that are found in few, if any, other organisms. The fl avouring principles of herbs and
fruit, the antibiotics from moulds and the toxic alkaloids in plants are all examples. These
compounds are what we mean by ‘natural products’, especially if they are useful to humans.
Natural products often seem to have little value to the organism itself, and are
made by the processes of secondary metabolism. They are classifi ed by the way
they are made into terpenes and steroids, alkaloids, and polyketides.

###### Alkaloids are made by amino acid metabolism

Alkaloids were known in ancient times because they are easy to extract from plants
and some of them have powerful and deadly effects. Any plant contains thousands
of chemical compounds, but some plants, like the deadly nightshade, can be mashed
up and extracted with aqueous acid to give a few compounds soluble in that medium,
which precipitate on neutralization. These compounds were seen to be ‘like alkali’
and in 1819 Meissner, the apothecary from Halle, named them ‘alkaloids’. Lucrezia
Borgia already knew all about this and put the deadly nightshade extract atropine
in her eyes (to make her look beautiful: atropine dilates the pupils) and in the drinks
of her political adversaries to avoid any trouble in the future. Now, we would simply
say that they are basic because they are amines. Below is a selection with the basic
amino groups marked in black. Natural products are often named by a combination
of the name of the organism from which they are isolated and a chemical part name.
These compounds are all amines so all their names end in ‘-ine’. They appear very
diverse in structure but all are made in nature from amino acids.

###### Pyrrolidine alkaloids are made from the amino acid ornithine

Pyrrolidine is the simple fi ve-membered cyclic amine and pyrrolidine alkaloids such as nicotine contain this ring. All are made in nature from ornithine. Ornithine is an amino acid not
usually found in proteins (it’s one carbon atom shorter than lysine) but most organisms use it,
often in the excretion of toxic substances. If birds are fed benzoic acid (PhCO2H) they excrete
dibenzoyl ornithine. When dead animals decay, the decarboxylation of ornithine leads to
putrescine, the smell of rotten meat.

Biosynthetic pathways are usually worked out by isotopic labelling of potential precursors
and in the schemes below the isotopically labelled atom is shown with a coloured blob. Some
plants—notably the coca plant—produce the simple pyrrolidine alkaloid hygrine, which we
will take as an illustration. If ornithine is made with a [14]C label at its α position and fed to the
plant, labelled hygrine is isolated. If each amino group in ornithine is labelled in turn with [15]N,
the α amino group is lost but the γ amino group is retained.

Further labelling experiments along these lines showed that the CO2H group as well as
the α amino group was lost from ornithine and that the rest of the molecule makes the
pyrrolidine ring. The three-carbon side chain in hygrine comes from acetate, or rather
from acetyl CoA, and the N-methyl group comes from (S)-adenosyl methionine (SAM, see
p. 1136).
Labelling studies such as these tell us the origin of the atoms in the natural product, and we
can now work through the biosynthesis—how the molecule is put together from those precursors. The fi rst step is a pyridoxal-catalysed decarboxylation of ornithine.

The rest of the hygrine structure comes from two molecules of acetyl CoA. We saw earlier in
this chapter that the thiol ester is a good electrophile and also enolizes easily. We need both
reactivities now in a Claisen ester condensation of acetyl CoA. The new keto-ester is very like
the acetoacetates we used in Chapter 25 to make stable enolates and the CoA thiol ester will
exist mainly as its enol, stabilized by conjugation.

The cell has a good stock of acetyl CoA and its condensation product, and as soon as the
iminium ion above is generated, it is attacked by the acetoacetyl CoA. All that remains to
form hygrine is the hydrolysis of the CoA thiol ester and decarboxylation of the keto-acid.
This is standard chemistry, but you should ensure that you can draw the mechanisms for
these steps.

###### Benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids are made from tyrosine

The benzyl isoquinolines are another family of alkaloids of rather different structure. They all
have a benzyl group attached to position 2 of an isoquinoline ring. Usually the alkaloids are
oxygenated on the benzene ring and many are found in opium poppies (Papaver somniferum).
For all these reasons papaverine is an ideal example.

###### Fatty acids and other polyketides are made from acetyl CoA

In the last part of this chapter we will show how nature can take a very simple molecule—
acetyl CoA—and build it up into an amazing variety of structures. There are two main pathways from acetyl CoA through malonyl CoA and mevalonic acid and each gives rise to two
important series of natural products. Malonyl CoA leads to fatty acids and polyketides while
mevalonic acid gives terpenes and steroids. We start with the simplest, the fatty acids. The list
below shows just a few of the fatty acids that exist: all are present in a typical diet and you’ll

Fatty acids have some important features which you should note:

 - They have straight chains with no branching.

 - They have even numbers of carbon atoms.

 - They may be saturated with no double bonds in the chain or they may have one or
more C=C double bonds in the chain, in which case they are usually cis (Z) alkenes.
If there is more than one C=C double bond, they are not conjugated (either with the
CO2H group or with each other)—there is normally one saturated carbon atom
between them.

Palmitic acid (C16 saturated) is the most common fatty acid in living things. Oleic acid (C18
mono-unsaturated) is the major fatty acid in olive oil. Arachidonic acid (C20 tetra-unsaturated)


-----

is a rare fatty acid, which is the precursor of the very important biological messengers the
prosta glandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes.
The prevalence of fatty acids with even numbers of carbon atoms suggests a two-carbon
building block, the most obvious being acetate. If labelled acetate is fed to plants, the fatty
acids emerge with labels on alternate carbons like this.

###### Malonyl CoA

Malonyl CoA is the thiol ester of
CoASH and malonic acid. It is
biosynthesized by acylation of
acetyl CoA with carbon dioxide.


The green blob might represent deuterium (as a CD3 group) and the black blob [13]C. In fact,
the reactions are more complex than this suggests as CO2 is also needed as well as CoA and it
turns out that only the fi rst two-carbon unit is put in as acetyl CoA. The remainder are added
as malonyl CoA. If labelled malonyl CoA is fed, the starter unit, as it is called, is not labelled.

**CoAS** **OH** biosynthesis **OH**


The fi rst stage in fatty acid biosynthesis is a condensation between acetyl CoA (the starter
unit) and malonyl CoA with the loss of CO2. This reaction could be drawn like this, with CO2
being lost as the new C–C bond is formed. When chemists use malonates, we like to make the

The next step is reduction of the ketone group. This NADPH reaction is typically stereoand chemoselective, although the stereochemistry is rather wasted here as the next step is a
de hydration, typical of what is now an aldol product, and occurring by an enzyme-catalysed
E1cB mechanism. The elimination is known to be a cis removal of H and OH, and the double
bond is exclusively trans (E). Finally in this cycle, the double bond is reduced using another
molecule of NADPH to give the saturated side chain.

###### What is so important about unsaturated fatty acids?

Mammals can insert a cis alkene into the chain, providing that it is no further away from the
carbonyl group than C9. We cannot synthesize linoleic or linolenic acids (see chart on p. 1161)
directly as they have alkenes at C12 and C15, so these acids must be present in our diet.


-----

But why are we so keen to have them? They are needed for the synthesis of arachidonic acid,
a C20 tetraenoic acid that is the precursor for some very interesting and important compounds.
This is the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid.

The fi nal product of this chain of events—arachidonic acid—is one of the eicosanoids, socalled because eicosa is Greek for twenty. The leukotrienes resemble arachidonic acid most
closely, the prostaglandins have a closed chain forming a fi ve-membered ring, and the thromboxanes resemble the prostaglandins but have a broken chain. All are C20 compounds with
the sites of the alkenes (C5, C8, C1 1, and C14) marked by functionality or some other structural feature.

asthma and arthritis.

###### Aromatic polyketides

Other starter units such as 4-hydroxycinamic acid, made from shikimic acid, can be used
to build up aromatic compounds. The addition of three malonyl CoA units gives a linear

###### Terpenes are volatile constituents of plants

Terpenes were originally named after turpentine, the volatile oil from pine trees used in oil
painting, whose major constituent is α-pinene. The term was rather vaguely used for all the
volatile oily compounds, insoluble in water and usually with resinous smells from plants. Oils
distilled from plants, which often contain perfumery or fl avouring materials, are called essential oils and these too contain terpenes. Examples include camphor from the camphor tree,
which is used to preserve clothes from moths, and humulene from hops, which helps to give
beer its fl avour.

**O**


α-pinene


camphor humulene


isoprene

3 isoprene units?


You will notice that they are all aliphatic compounds with a scattering of double bonds and
rings, few functional groups, and an abundance of methyl groups. A better defi nition (that is,
a biosynthetically based defi nition) arose when it was noticed that all these compounds have
5n carbon atoms. Pinene and camphor are C10 compounds while humulene is C15. It seemed
obvious that terpenes were made from a C5 precursor and the favourite candidate was isoprene (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) as all these structures can be drawn by joining together 2-, 3-,
or 4-isoprene skeletons end to end.


-----

In fact, this is not correct. Isoprene is not an intermediate, and the discovery of the true
pathway started when acetate was, rather surprisingly, found to be the original precursor for
all terpenes. The key intermediate is mevalonic acid, formed from three acetate units and usually isolated as its lactone.

The fi rst step is the Claisen ester condensation of two molecules of acetyl CoA, one acting as an enol and the other as an electrophilic acylating agent to give acetoacetyl CoA.

The third molecule of acetyl CoA also functions as a nucleophilic enol and attacks the keto

between the enol of a thiol ester and an electrophilic ketone.

We have drawn the product with stereochemistry even though it is not chiral. This is
because one of the two enantiotopic thiol esters is hydrolysed while this intermediate is still

The remaining thiol ester is more electrophilic than the acid and can be reduced by the
nucleophilic hydride from NADPH. Just as in LiBH4 reductions of esters (Chapter 23), the reaction does not stop at the aldehyde level, and two molecules of NADPH are used to make the
alcohol. This is mevalonic acid.

Mevalonic acid is indeed the true precursor of the terpenes but it is a C6 compound and so
it must lose a carbon atom to give the C5 precursor. The spare carbon atom becomes CO2 by
an elimination reaction. First, the primary alcohol is pyrophosphorylated with ATP; then the
CO2H group and the tertiary alcohol are lost in a concerted elimination.

So is isopentenyl pyrophosphate the C5 intermediate at last? Well, yes and no. There are
actually two closely related C5 intermediates, each of which has a specifi c and appropriate role
in terpene biosynthesis. Isopentenyl pyrophosphate is in equilibrium with dimethylallyl
pyrophosphate by a simple allylic proton transfer.

The two C5 intermediates now react with each other. The dimethylallyl pyrophosphate is
the better electrophile because it is allylic, and allylic compounds are good at both SN1 and
SN2 reactions (Chapter 15). Isopentenyl pyrophosphate is the better nucleophile because it
can react through an unhindered primary carbon atom to produce a tertiary cation—we can
draw the reaction like this:


**OPP**

better (allylic) electrophile better nucleophile stable tertiary cation


**OPP**


Although this idea reveals the thinking behind the reaction, in fact it does not go quite like
this. The product is one particular positional and geometrical isomer of an alkene and the
cation is not an intermediate. Indeed, the reaction is also stereospecifi c (discovered again by
proton labelling, but we will not give the rather complex details) and this too suggests a concerted process.

**OPP**

**OPP**


As soon as we start to make typical cyclic monoterpenes from geranyl pyrophosphate we
run into a snag. We cannot cyclize geranyl pyrophosphate because it has a trans double bond!
We could cyclize the cis compound (neryl pyrophosphate), and it used to be thought that this
was formed from the trans compound as an intermediate.

It is now known that nature gets round this problem without making neryl pyrophosphate.
An allylic rearrangement occurs to move the pyrophosphate group to the tertiary centre. This
is an unfavourable rearrangement thermodynamically and probably occurs via the allyl cation and is catalysed by Mg(II). There is no longer any geometry about the alkene. The molecule can now rotate freely about a single bond and cyclization can occur. Even if only a small
amount of the rearranged allylic pyrophosphate is present, that can rearrange and more can
isomerize.

More interesting compounds come from the cyclization of the fi rst formed cation. The

The elucidation of the ways in which organic chemistry underpins life, along with the use
of organic chemistry to construct in the laboratory the molecules used by nature, has been
one of the greatest scientifi c success stories of recent decades. In this chapter we have revealed
but a glimpse of the immense complexity of the world of biological organic chemistry; you
will fi nd an extended version of this discussion in the three chapters on the web, and a book
on biochemistry will fi ll in more detail. The beautiful molecular structures of nature and the
reactions used to make them have provided an example for organic chemists to follow—sometimes at a distance, but always in hot pursuit. The next and fi nal chapter of this book tells a
few stories of how such scientifi c inspiration is the key to the future of chemistry, not only for
its own sake, but also for the sake of the millions of people whose lives have been improved or
even saved by the ingenuity of chemists.

###### Science advances through interaction between disciplines

Just as the stonemasons who worked out how to build the great gothic cathedrals of the middle ages transformed architecture, the organic chemists who build molecules on a scale 10[10]
times smaller have transformed our expectations of everyday life. When we are ill, we expect
there to be a drug to treat us; when we need to mend something, we expect there to be a sealant, glue, or coating to solve our problem. We expect paints, plastics, and clothes of any colour. If an engineer needs a material with certain properties of strength and fl exibility, she
expects organic chemists to be able to make it. If a biologist needs a molecule to inhibit an
enzyme selectively, he expects organic chemists to be able to make it. In the future the same
will be true of plastics that conduct electricity or emit light, or drugs tailored to your own
individual genetic makeup. The creative art of organic chemistry has transformed our ability
to understand and manipulate the world on a molecular scale and above, and it has been able
to do this because of the collaboration between those who can make molecules and those who
can use them—between chemists, physicists, engineers, and materials scientists.
The most dramatic scientifi c developments involving organic chemistry at the beginning of
the 21st century are new methods in medicine from collaborations between organic chemists
and biologists. Progress is slow but secure across a whole range of diseases long thought
impregnable to treatment. That media favourite, ‘the cure for cancer’, is already not just ‘a
cure’ but hundreds of successful cures for the hundreds of diseases collectively called ‘cancer’.
At the turn of the twenty-fi rst century, it was the case that there was some chance of survival
for all known types of childhood cancer. The drug Glivec, launched in 2001, now essentially
cures 75% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. 5-Fluorouracil is a well-established
chemotherapy drug that slows down the progression of cancer. But in conjunction with
Avastin, which prevents tumours developing their own blood supply, it is much more effective against certain colon cancers. Avastin in conjunction with Taxol (launched in 1992)
increases Taxol’s effectiveness against breast cancer. Avastin was launched in 2004, and is
expected to be the world’s biggest selling drug by 2014.

Pacifi c yew tree that can be made at great expense in the laboratory, and for a while was produced by chemical modifi cation of a common precursor that can be harvested. It is now made
by fermentation using cultured yew tree cells. Avastin is at the other end of the scale of complexity: it is an antibody against a protein involved in blood vessel growth, and we have represented only its gross structure: a detailed structural diagram would be huge. The antibody was
induced in mice, its protein sequence was determined and then modifi ed using the techniques
of molecular biology which grew out of organic chemistry in the 1960s and 1970s, and it is
produced by expression of the modifi ed gene in bacteria. Which of this is chemistry, which is
biology, and which is medicine? There is no point deciding.

###### Chemistry vs viruses

We are going to spend most of this chapter discussing two medical developments, both
battles pitting chemists against viruses: one is partly won, and one has fortunately not yet
been fought. Like cancer, viruses are an insidious menace because they subvert the body’s
own biochemical machinery to cause harm, but since the middle of the last century, with
antibiotics being used to treat bacterial infections, the threat from infectious disease
seemed to be in retreat. So when AIDS (acquired immune defi ciency syndrome) fi rst came
into the news in the 1980s, medics struggled to explain the mysterious deaths from normally harmless diseases after the patient’s immune system had been weakened and eventually destroyed. But the cause was soon identifi ed by biologists as a new virus, HIV (human
immunodefi ciency virus), and antiviral drugs, notably AZT, were used with some success.
These drugs imitate natural nucleosides (AZT imitates deoxythymidine) and inhibit the
virus from copying its RNA into DNA inside human cells by inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme.
As is often the problem with antiviral (and anticancer) chemotherapy, the drugs also inhibit
the normal function of essential human enzymes and are very toxic. But biologists discovered
an alternative point of attack. An enzyme unique to the virus cuts up long proteins into small
pieces essential for the formation of new HIV particles. If this enzyme could be inhibited, no
new viruses would be formed and neither should the inhibitor interfere with human
biochemistry.
Blocking HIV protease inhibitors means mimicking the proteins they slice up, but real peptides are usually poor drugs because humans have their own peptidases which quickly cut up
ingested proteins by hydrolysis of the amide link. The solution is to make a drug which looks
like the peptide but can’t be hydrolysed because the C–N bond of the peptide has been
replaced by a C–C bond (green parts of the structures below).

This stops the drug being hydrolysed, but the drug also has to stop the viral protein being
hydrolysed. To get it to do this, medicinal chemists used another trick. Enzymes work by binding the transition state for a reaction, and while of course the chemists couldn’t make a transition state (it is by its nature unstable) they made a molecule with a suffi cient resemblance to
the tetrahedral intermediate for amide hydrolysis (black parts of molecules above) that the
protease is tricked into taking it into its active site, where it blocks the protease’s function.
The knowledge that only one of the two hydroxyl groups of the tetrahedral intermediate
was needed was acquired from an X-ray crystal structure showing how the enzyme binds the
substrate. Other structural information was also used to design the drugs: for example, HIV
protease is a dimeric enzyme and experience with this class of protease suggested correctly
that more or less symmetrically placed aromatic or heterocyclic rings would greatly improve
binding. Two successful protease inhibitors are shown below, with the active site binding portion in brown and the heterocyclic binding portions in green.

###### The synthesis of indinavir

Indinavir was a formidable synthetic target. It was probably the most complex compound
ever made in quantity by organic synthesis and the 3 g per day dose meant that huge quantities were required. The complexity largely arises from the stereochemistry. As with all chiral
new drugs, it is a single enantiomer: there are fi ve stereogenic centres, marked with coloured
circles on the diagram below, and their disposition means that three separate pieces of asymmetric synthesis must be devised.

The challenge with indinavir, as with any drug, is to make it effi ciently: high yields, few
steps. We can start by looking at some likely disconnections, summarized in the scheme
above. They are all disconnections of the sorts you met in Chapter 28, and they all correspond
to reliable reactions. These disconnections split the molecule into fi ve manageable fragments,
three of which contain stereogenic centres and will have to be made as single enantiomers.
One of the orange stereogenic centres would have to be made in the enolate alkylation step,
so this step will need to be diastereoselective.
Let’s take the three chiral fragments in turn. First, the simplest one: the central epoxide. The
reagent we need here will carry a leaving group, such as a tosylate, to allow it to alkylate the
piperazine to the left, and it can easily be made from an epoxyalcohol. This gives a very good
way of making this compound as a single enantiomer—a Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of
allyl alcohol.

Next, the piperazine fragment. This has two nucleophilic nitrogen atoms and they will both
need protecting with different protecting groups to allow them to be revealed one at a time.
It will also need to be made as a single enantiomer. In an early route to indinavir, this was
done by resolution, but enantioselective hydrogenation provides a better alternative. Starting
from a pyrazine derivative, a normal hydrogenation over palladium on charcoal could be
stopped at the tetrahydropyrazine stage. The two nitrogens in this compound have different
reactivities because one is conjugated with the amide while one is not (the curly arrows in the
margin show this). The more nucleophilic nitrogen—the one not conjugated with the amide—
was protected with benzyl chloroformate to give the Cbz derivative. Now the less reactive
nitrogen can be protected with a Boc group, using DMAP as a base.

You met asymmetric hydrogenation using BINAP complexes of rhodium in Chapter 41 as a
method for the synthesis of amino acids. The substrate and catalyst are slightly different here,
but the principle is the same: the chiral ligand, BINAP, directs addition of hydrogen across one
of the enantiotopic faces of the double bond with almost perfect enantioselectivity and in
very high yield. A further hydrogenation step allowed selective removal of the Cbz group,
preparing one of the two nitrogen atoms for alkylation.

indene. First, the double bond is epoxidized, not with m-CPBA but with the cheaper hydrogen peroxide in an acetonitrile/methanol mixture, which generates a peroxyimidic acid (the
C=N analogue of a peracid) as the active oxidant. Acid-catalysed opening of the epoxide
leads to a cation, which takes part in a reversible Ritter reaction with the acetonitrile solvent,
leading to a single diastereoisomer of a heterocyclic intermediate, which is hydrolysed to the
amino-alcohol.

The product is, of course, racemic but, as it is an amine, resolution with an acid should be
straightforward. Crystallization of its tartrate salt, for example, leads to the required single
enantiomer in 99.9% ee. With such cheap starting materials, resolution is just about acceptable, even though it wastes half the material. It would be better to oxidize the indene enantioselectively, and the solution here, as you saw in Chapter 41, is to use a Jacobsen epoxidation,
which gives the epoxide in 79% yield and 84% ee.

Only one, orange, stereogenic centre remains, and its stereoselective formation turns out to
be the most remarkable reaction of the whole synthesis. The centre is the one created in the
planned enolate alkylation step, shown in the margin. The obvious way to make this centre is
to make Y a chiral auxiliary, which would direct a diastereoselective alkylation before being
removed and replaced with the amino-alcohol portion.
But the Merck chemists noticed that amino alcohol itself, certainly once protected, has a
remarkable similarity to Evans’ oxazolidinone auxiliaries anyway, and it turns out that this
amino alcohol will function very successfully as a chiral auxiliary, which does not need to be
removed, avoiding waste and saving steps! The amino alcohol was acylated with the acyl
chloride, and the amide was protected as the nitrogen analogue of an acetonide by treating
with 2-methoxypropene (the methyl enol ether of acetone) and an acid catalyst. The enolate

The reason for the stereoselectivity is not altogether clear, but we would expect the bulky
nitrogen substituents to favour formation of the cis enolate. With the amino-alcohol portion
arranged as shown, the top face is more open to attack by electrophiles. The enolate also reacts
diastereoselectively with the epoxy-tosylate prepared earlier. The epoxide, being more electrophilic than the tosylate, is opened fi rst, giving an alkoxide, which closes again to give a new
epoxide. The absolute confi guration at the stereogenic centre within the epoxide was, of
course, already fi xed (by the earlier enantioselective Sharpless epoxidation).

Three of the fi ve fragments have now been assembled, and only the two amine alkylations
remain. The fi rst alkylation makes use of the epoxide to introduce the required 1,2-aminoalcohol functionality. The protected enantiomerically pure piperazine reacted with the epoxide, and the product was treated with acid to deprotect both the second piperazine nitrogen
and the gem-dimethyl group left over from the earlier chiral auxiliary step. The newly liberated secondary amine was alkylated with the reactive electrophile 3-chloromethyl pyridine,
and the fi nal product was crystallized as its sulfate salt.

###### The synthesis of oseltamivir

Our second example of the use of chemistry to save lives is more recent. Several times in the
last century major epidemics of infl uenza have caused deaths, sometimes running into millions. Virologists tell us that a global infl uenza pandemic is a constant danger, and a number
of times in recent years highly aggressive forms of the fl u virus have found their way from
other animals (often poultry or pigs) into the human population. Fortunately, at the time of
writing, none has caused more than a few thousand deaths, the most serious being the swine
fl u pandemic of 2009–10, which claimed the lives of 18,000 people, many of them in Mexico.


-----

To put this in context, the 1918 fl u epidemic, which was caused by the same strain (H1N1) of
virus, killed 50–100 million, 3% of the world’s population at the time.
Vaccination can prevent the spread of fl u, but infl uenza vaccines are slow to produce and
diffi cult to generalize because of the rate of mutation of the virus. So the fi rst line of defence
is a class of antiviral compounds known as neuraminidase inhibitors. Neuraminidase is an
enzyme used by the fl u virus that targets human cell-surface carbohydrates containing neuraminic acids and allows the virus to release itself from the host cell. Inhibition of this enzyme
prevents the new virus particles from spreading.
The drug oseltamivir (Tamifl u), developed by the companies Gilead and Roche, is a neuraminidase inhibitor. Like the HIV proteases described above, it has enough structural similarity with the enzyme’s substrate to bind to the enzyme, but once bound it blocks the
enzyme’s activity. No-one knows how much oseltamivir might be needed if ever a fl u pandemic took hold, but clearly the safest course of action is to stockpile the compound in readiness for such an event. The fi rst manufacturing route to oseltamivir made use of the natural
product (–)-quinic acid as a naturally derived starting material. Quinic acid is found in coffee
beans, but is not available in suffi cient quantities for widespread use.

oseltamivir (Tamiflu) neuraminic acid


A preferable starting material, and the one that for several years now has been used as the
source of the commercial drug, is (–)-shikimic acid. Shikimic acid is the plant metabolite that
provides the biochemical precursor to the aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. It is abundant in the spice star anise, grown in China, which can yield
3–7% of shikimic acid.
The similarity of both quinic and shikimic acid with the target drug is obvious; what is
perhaps remarkable is just how many steps it takes to get from one to the other. The majority
of these steps are concerned with the introduction of the two amino substituents with inversion of stereochemistry at the coloured stereogenic centres. Chiral pool syntheses often have
to take long convoluted routes to correct relatively minor ‘errors’ of structure and stereochemistry. Here this is simply the price we have to pay for a starting material that has the valuable
qualities of enantiomeric purity and the right hydrocarbon skeleton.
Oseltamivir is an ethyl ester, and esterifi cation comes fi rst, followed by selective protection
of the cis diol (the cis-6,5-ring system is more stable than the alternative trans) and conversion
of the remaining hydroxyl group to a methanesulfonate leaving group.

The dioxolane, which is crystalline and easily purifi ed, is then exchanged for the acetal derived

The reduction of the acetal is catalysed by a Lewis acid and goes via an oxonium ion,
which collects hydride from the mild reducing agent triethylsilane. Silanes react only
with cationic electrophiles. The oxonium ion could open either way, but this one is less
hindered and possibly allows the titanium some favourable interaction with the mesylate
substituent.

Two amino groups now need introducing with rather specifi c stereoselectivity, and the next
key intermediate is an aziridine, the nitrogen analogue of an epoxide. Azide is not completely
regioselective in opening this epoxide, but both regioisomers are formed with complete inversion of confi guration.
Azides may be reduced to amines with triphenylphosphine in what is known as the
Staudinger reaction. The probable mechanism involves attack of triphenylphosphine on the
azide and formation of a phosphinimine via a four-membered intermediate—notice the similarity with the Wittig reaction!

When the azide has an adjacent hydroxyl group, something more interesting happens: the
phosphinimine intermediate in the reaction is intercepted by the alcohol, which turns itself
into a leaving group. Extrusion of the stable phosphine oxide gives an aziridine, with inversion of stereochemistry as the nitrogen displaces the leaving group. Here is the result with the
major azide from the oseltamivir synthesis:

In this case, it doesn’t matter which azide you start with: triphenylphosphine converts them
both to the same aziridine. Like epoxides, aziridines open with nucleophiles under acid catalysis, and azide is used again to put in the second amino group by attack at the less hindered
end of the aziridine. To get the right amino group acetylated, the amide is formed before the
azide is reduced, this time with tributylphosphine. The drug is formulated as a stable phosphate salt by treatment with phosphoric acid.

This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, an effi cient synthesis, not least because there
are two uses of potentially explosive azides, and large amounts of waste are produced from the
phosphine steps. However, for several years it was the best route available, and Roche operated
it as a manufacturing process on a tonne scale. In the last few years, however, several modifi cations have been published, and among the most effi cient of the alternatives was one devised
in 2006 by the Nobel prize-winning chemist E. J. Corey. Corey’s route built on the fact that
oseltamivir is a cyclohexene, and as you saw in Chapter 34 cyclohexenes are made effi ciently
by a Diels–Alder reaction.

Corey’s research group combined the two very cheap reagents butadiene and trifl uoroethyl
acrylate in the fi rst step of their alternative synthesis: the cycloadduct already has the scaffold
of oseltamivir. Not starting with a natural product has its advantages and disadvantages: no
longer is supply limited by the world production of coffee beans or star anise, and no longer is
there a need to make do with a compound of the wrong relative stereochemistry, wasting valuable resources inverting stereogenic centres in the course of the synthesis. However, as you
know from Chapter 41, making an enantiomerically pure compound like oseltamivir _must_
involve a natural compound somewhere along the line. Diels–Alder reactions are catalysed by


-----

- We illustrated a chiral
auxiliary approach to asymmetric
Diels–Alder reactions in Chapter
41, but it was clearly better to
avoid the extra steps and
recycling involved in large-scale
synthesis with an auxiliary.


Lewis acids, and so by using a catalytic amount of the chiral Lewis acid (whose structure is
evidently based on that of the CBS catalyst) it was possible to induce the cycloaddition to proceed enantioselectively.
The product of the Diels–Alder reaction has the ester substituent in place, and the stereochemistry at the single chiral centre has to be used to control stereochemistry at new centres
in the molecule. We discussed strategies for doing this in Chapters 32 and 33, and in this case
the use of a tethered nucleophile (p. 847) allowed the fi rst amino group to be introduced with
the correct stereochemistry. Conversion of the ester to an amide followed by treatment with
iodine induced in the nitrogen equivalent of an iodolactonization (an iodolactamization),
placing the nitrogen syn to the ester and the iodide trans.

The next key intermediate is a diene, which is reached by an overall oxidation of the iodide:
protection of nitrogen and elimination of the iodide gives the only possible alkene. Radical
bromination with NBS followed by treatment with base in ethanol both hydrolyses the lactam and eliminates bromide to give the diene.

Now for the second nitrogen substituent. Bromination of the less electron defi cient end of
the diene with N-bromoacetamide in the presence of SnBr4 leads to an intermediate bromonium ion which is opened by the acetamide by-product at the more reactive end adjacent to
the alkene, giving a trans diaxial product.

Overall, Corey’s route uses just 12 steps, and gives a yield of 30%—about double that of

conditions or solvents (such as carbon tetrachloride) that are unsuitable for industrial use.
Advances are still being made, with even shorter routes being reported since 2006. In some
ways it would be best if this vital work were never made necessary, but across the world chemists are working in similar ways to relieve suffering, and potential suffering, caused by illness
and disease.

###### The future of organic chemistry

Not all organic chemists can be involved in such exciting projects as the launching of a lifesaving antiviral drug. Some most certainly have to be: resistant bacteria are fast catching up
with our current range of antibiotics, and it is teams of organic chemists, in conjunction with
biologists, who will be able to erect the next line of defence against these infections. But the
chemistry used in such frontline projects is often the product of work by chemists in other
institutions who had no idea that it would eventually be used to make a vital drug.
Take the millions of lives saved by the synthesis of indinavir, for example. This drug would
not have been possible had not the Sharpless and Jacobsen asymmetric epoxidations, the catalytic asymmetric reduction, and the stereoselective enolate alkylation, along with many of
the methods tried but not used in the fi nal synthesis, been invented and developed by organic
chemists in academic and industrial research laboratories. Some of the more famous names
involved, like Sharpless, Jacobsen, and Noyori, invented new methods, while others modifi ed
and optimized those methods, and still others applied the methods to new types of molecules. Yet all built on the work of other chemists.
We can delve deeper into one of the steps in the indinavir synthesis. In 1980 Giovanni
Casiraghi, a rather less famous chemist from the University of Parma, published a paper in the
_Journal of the Chemical Society about selective reactions between phenols and formaldehyde._
He and his colleagues made the modest discovery that controlled reactions to give salicylaldehydes could be achieved in toluene with SnCl4 as catalyst. The reaction is regioselective for the
_ortho isomer and the paper described the rather precise conditions needed to get a good yield._

The reaction was also successful for substituted salicylaldehydes. When Jacobsen came to
develop his asymmetric epoxidation, he chose salens as his catalysts, partly because they
could be made so easily from salicylaldehydes.
Jacobsen epoxidation turned out to be the best large-scale method for preparing the cisaminoindanol for the synthesis of indinavir. This process is very much the cornerstone of the
whole synthesis. It cannot have entered Casiraghi’s wildest dreams that his work might someday be useful in a matter of life and death. Neither did his four co-workers nor Jacobsen’s more
numerous co-workers see clearly the future applications of their work. By its very nature it is
impossible to predict the outcome or the applications of research. But one thing is certain:
good research and exciting discoveries come from a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of organic chemistry.
When Jacobsen’s epoxidation was fully described in 1998–99, the Casiraghi method was
abandoned in favour of an even older method discovered in the 1930s by Duff. The remarkable
Duff reaction uses hexamethylenetetramine, the oligomer of formaldehyde and ammonia, to
provide the extra carbon atom. The now otherwise unknown Duff worked at Birmingham
Technical College. Later in 1972, a William E. Smith, working in the GEC chemical laboratories

at Schenectady, New York, found how to make the Duff reaction more general and better yielding by using CF3CO2H as catalyst. Even so, this method gives a lower yield than the Casiraghi
method but it uses less toxic reagents (in particularly it avoids stoichiometric tin) and is more
suitable for large-scale work. When Duff was inventing his reaction or Smith was modifying
the conditions, asymmetric synthesis was not even a gleam in anyone’s eyes. It is impossible
even for the inventor to predict whether a discovery is important or not.
Where is organic chemistry going next? As we write this chapter, advances are being made
in reactions which would have seemed outlandish even just ten years ago. Work published in
the years since 2005 has shown, for example, that many reactions of cations can be made to
form single enantiomers of products even if they take place just in the vicinity of a chiral
anion. Reactions such as the one below, from 2008, promise to revolutionize, yet again, some
of the ways in which chemists make chiral compounds.

Finding drugs is a diffi cult job, and the number of new drugs launched each year is dropping
as it becomes harder and more expensive to advance beyond existing treatments and as
demands for more stringent safety rightly increase. But new drugs are made because...they
can be made! What about all those classes of molecules which have never been made, simply
because they have never been needed? Among them may well be molecules that will have all
the specifi c attributes we want a potential drug to exhibit. Techniques known as diversity orientated synthesis are now addressing this idea—how to make and study great families of fundamentally different but potentially revolutionary molecules simply and effi ciently. It’s too
early to tell, but the hope is that these techniques will provide breakthroughs in the fi ght
against disease by fi nding completely new ways to attack their causes.
Nature is a superb synthetic chemist, and organic chemists have spent the last century
exploring effi cient ways of building molecular structures more effi ciently than nature. Nature
builds molecules a certain way because there is no alternative—molecules can be biosynthesized only if the enzymes to make them exist; enzymes are only made from the same 20
amino acids; amino acids are built into proteins by the same ribosome. The ribosome is the
most complex and beautiful molecular structure in the known universe, but it can make only
proteins. Chemists, with the periodic table, a supply of raw materials, a laboratory, and their
ingenuity can make anything. Sometimes chemists use Nature’s enzymes to do a job, or even
force them to evolve to do a job better. By cloning useful enzymes in bacteria and forcing
them to mutate, high-speed evolution can be induced, and enzymes can be created which do
a job better, faster, or at a different temperature from their original ‘wild type’ ancestors.
More often chemists use reactions nature can never use—Rh, Ru, Pd, or phosphine ligands
for that matter have never been exploited by any known biological process. What molecules
chemists will make next, and how they make them, may determine the well-being of huge
numbers of people in the future, but we may well not know it until then.

That future is yours as you continue your studies in organic chemistry beyond the scope of
this book, and if you do you will want to read about modern work in more specialized areas.
Your university library should have a selection of books on related topics we have only touched
on, such as orbitals and chemical reactions, NMR spectroscopy, molecular modelling physical
organic chemistry, photochemistry, enzyme mechanisms, biosynthesis, organometallic
chemistry, asymmetric synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, and polymer and materials
chemistry. This book will equip you with enough fundamental organic chemistry to explore
these topics with understanding and enjoyment, and, perhaps, to discover what you want to
do for the rest of your life. All of the chemists mentioned in this chapter and throughout the
book began their careers as students of chemistry at universities somewhere in the world. You
have the good fortune to study chemistry at a time when more is understood about the subject than ever before, when information is easier to retrieve than ever before, and when
organic chemistry is more interrelated with other disciplines than ever before.
