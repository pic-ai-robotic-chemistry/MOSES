It was found that host 2 could form stable complexes with acetyl choline, thiaacetyl choline, N N N , , -trimethylbenzenammonium salt, pyridinium and 4,4'-bipyridinium salts in solution and/or in the solid state. The unsubstituted macrocycle 1 showed more significant complexation with the widely tested quaternary ammonium salts and N -heterocyclic salts,  and  exhibited  stronger  complexation  towards  the  guests  than  its  derivative 2 .  Moreover,  it  was  found  that  macrocycle 1 and  its derivative 2 could  also  complex  with  neutral  electron-deficient  tetracyanoquinodimethane  (TCNQ),  and  the  association  constants  were determined  to  be  2840± 94  and  1358± 46  M -1 ,  respectively.

[2]  Undoubtedly, macrocyclic  hosts  play  key  roles  in  host-guest  chemistry,  and the development of novel macrocyclic hosts with the capabilities of binding different kinds of substrates has always been one of the  most  important  topics  in  this  research  area. [3] Macrocyclic arenes including calixarenes, [4] resorcinarenes, [5] cyclotriveratrylenes, [6] pillararenes, [7] and their analogues [8]  have become  one  kind  of  the  most  extensively  studied  synthetic macrocyclic hosts for their potential applications in the fields of biology, [4c, 9] environment, [10] and materials science. [11] Moreover, various supramolecular assemblies such as rotaxanes, catenanes  and  vesicles  based  on  these  macrocyclic  arenes could also be constructed and applied in supramolecular catalysis, [12] sensors [13] and supramolecular polymers.

The unique rigid three-dimensional structures  enable  them  to  be  widely  applied  in  supramolecular chemistry, [16] synthetic molecular machines, [17] materials science [18] and other research areas. [19]  Recently, we reported a novel  macrocyclic  arene  named  2,6-helix[6]arene,  which  was composed of three chiral triptycene moieties, and had a hex nut- like structure with a helical chiral cavity and highly fixed conformation. [20] The crystal structure showed that the macrocycle had a large cavity which could be compared to that of pillar[6]arene, [21] β -cyclodextrin [22] or cucurbit[7]uril. [23] It  could be  deduced  that  this  macrocyclic  host with the large and electron-rich cavity would exhibit complexation properties towards  a  wide  range  of  guests,  especially  electron-deficient guests, which would be important in exploring functional applications  of  this  new  macrocyclic  host  and  its  derivatives. Herein,  we  report  the  complexation  properties  of  racemic  2,6helic[6]arene 1 and  its  hexamethyl-substituted  derivative rac2 (Figure  1)  in  details.  It  was  found  that  the  host rac2 showed significant complexation with quaternary ammonium salts and N -heterocyclic salts in both solution and  in the solid state. Moreover, we found that unsubstituted host rac1 exhibited even stronger complexation towards the widely tested guests (Figure 2)  than  its  derivative rac2 probably  due  to  the  extra  noncovalent interactions between host rac1 and the guests. Additionally, it was also found that rac1 and its derivative rac -2 could complex with TCNQ, and the association constants were determined to be 2840± 94 and 1358± 46 M -1 , respectively.",

[ 25 ] Therefore,  we  firstly  investigated  the complexation  ability  of  the  hexamethyl-substituted  macrocycle rac2 with acetyl choline G1 in solution by  H NMR spectroscopy. 1 As  shown  in  Figure  3 ， when  equivalent rac2 and  guest G1 were  mixed  in  1:1  ( v v / )  CDCl3/acetoned 6 (2.00  mM),  the 1 H NMR spectrum showed a distinctive difference from that of free rac2 and  guest G1 ,  which  demonstrated  the  formation  of  the complex.  The  proton  signals  of rac2 all  downfield  shifted  to some extent, but the signals of the trimethylamino proton Ha and the two methylene protons Hb and Hc were difficult to distinguish. Through gradually adding guest G1 into the solution of rac2 , the complexation-induced broadened signals of protons Ha, Hb, and Hc were assigned and found to exhibit significant upfield shifts, while the acetyl proton Hd of the guest showed a relatively small downfield shift (  δ = -0.05 ppm). These observations suggested that in the complexation between rac2 and G1 , the trimethylamino group of the guest was located inside the cavity of  the  macrocycle,  and  acetyl  group  might  be  outside  of  the cavity. Moreover, molar ratio plot based on the  1 H NMR titration data showed the complexation between rac2 and guest G1 was in a 1:1 mode. In the same tested conditions, rac2 with acetyl thiocholine G2 showed similar complexation behavior to that in complex rac2· G1 and  formed  1:1  complex rac2· G2 (Figure S40). According  to the 1 H  NMR  titration experiments,  the association  constants Ka of  complexes rac2· G1 and rac2· G2 were calculated to be (5.30± 0.59)× 10 2  and (1.67± 0.25)× 10 3  M -1 , respectively,  by  using  a  nonlinear  curve  fitting  method.

        "content": "From the ESPs of the free host rac1 as shown in Figure 9a and  9b,  it  was  found  that  the  benzene  rings  surrounding  the cavity of the host were electron-rich, while the ESPs of the free guests showed that the N atoms of G2 and G13 were electronpoor (Figure 9c and 9d). Therefore, it was easy to deduce that the N atoms of the guests would locate in the center of the cavity of  the  host  through  electrostatic  interaction  in  the  host-guest complexes. Moreover, the structures of the complexes rac1· G2 and rac1· G13 were also simulated in acetone (Figures S115). The  relative  Gibbs  free  energies  were  calculated  to  be  -26.56 and -18.13 kJ/mol, respectively, which were consistent with the experimental  results.  It  was  further  found  that  in  the  complex rac1· G2 , the Mulliken atomic charges of the host and the guest were  0.9084  and  0.0916,  respectively.  The  Mulliken  atomic charges  of  the  host  and  the  guest  in  the  complex rac1· G13 were  0.8760  and  0.1240,  respectively.  These  results  indicated that partial positive charges were transfered from the guests to the host in the formation of the complexes.\nFigure  9. ESPs mapped onto electron density isosurfaces (ρ = 0.01) for (a) top view and (b) side view of calculated structure of rac -1, (c) G2 and (d) G13 .\nComplexation  between  hosts rac1  and rac2  and TCNQ. TCNQ is a neutral electron-poor compound, so we also tested its complexation with hosts rac1 and rac2 . As shown in Figure 10b, when guest G18 was added into the CDCl3 solution of 1.0 equivalent rac2 , the NMR spectra showed that both complexed and  uncomplexed  signals  were  observed,  which  indicated  a slow-exchange  complexation.  Proton  Ha  of  the  guest  showed strikingly upfield shifted (  δ = -2.91 ppm), which might be due to the  strong  shielding  effect  of  the  macrocycle.  Besides, the proton signals of host rac2 were all shifted downfield. Moreover,",

The association  constant Ka of rac2· G18 was  further  calculated  to be 1358± 46 M -1  by the integration from a 1 : 1 mixture using the 1 H NMR single point method. [28]\nFigure 10.

The  results  showed  that  the  cross-peaks  were  detected between  the  proton  Ha  of G18 and  protons  H3  and  H4  in  the benzene  ring  of  the  host  (Figure  S114),  which  suggested  that guest G18 threaded the central cavity of host rac2 to form a 1:1 complex.  Under  the  same  tested  conditions,  it  was  also  found that  host rac1 with  guest G18 showed  similar  complexation behavior  to  that  of rac2· G18 (Figure  10d),  and  formed  a  1:1 complex rac1· G18 with the association constant of 2840± 94 M -1 , which  was  larger  than  that  of  complex rac2· G18 .  This  result might be ascribed to the multiple hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxy groups of host rac1 and guest G18 .",

Especially,  we  found  that  the  unsubstituted  2,6helic[6]arene rac -1 could show significant complexation with the widely  tested  quaternary  ammonium  salts  and N -heterocyclic salts,  and  exhibited  stronger  complexation  than  those  of  its hexamethyl-substituted  derivative.  Moreover,  it  was  found  that racemic  2,6-helic[6]arene 1 and  its  derivative 2 could  also complex with neutral electron-deficient TCNQ to form stable 1:1 complexes  with  the  association  constants of 2840± 94  and 1358± 46 M -1 ,  respectively.  Besides,  the  large  and  electron-rich cavity, fixed conformation and easily functionalization of the 2,6helic[6]arene, its complexation abilities towards different kinds of tested  guests  could  make  this  new  macrocyclic  host  find  wide applications in the design and construction of various supramolecular assemblies with specific structures and properties, which are underway in our group.",
