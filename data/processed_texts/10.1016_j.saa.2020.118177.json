        "content": "Aminoacids are one of the most important classes of building blocks for proteins and peptides [1]. The twenty natural amino acids are widely distributed in food, condiments, pharmaceutical preparations, and even metabolites in the human body [2,3]. As a consequence, the development of reliable methods for amino acid recognition and determination are of great signi /uniFB01 cance in food testing, nutritional analysis, medical diagnostics, and for numerous other /uniFB01 elds [4 -9]. To date, many methods, including high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [10], gas chromatography (GC) [11], capillary electrophoresis (CE) [12],and optical techniques [13,14], have been employed for the recognition and detection of the twenty natural amino acids. Among the optical techniques, the /uniFB02 uorescence approach is particular attractive given its excellent selectivity, fast response time, low detection limits, and the inexpensive instrumentation required [15]. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to develop an effective /uniFB02 uorescent probe system for the detection of speci /uniFB01 c amino acids.\nThe synthetic macrocyclic receptors, cucurbit[ n ]urils (abbreviated as Q[ n ]s, Fig. 1) comprise n glycoluril units bridged by 2 n methylene groups [16 -21],and possess hydrophobic cavities and carbonyl-laced portals.

In recent years, Q[ n ]s and derivatives thereof have been reported to encapsulate a number of speci /uniFB01 c amino acids, peptides and proteins [30 -39]. It is well recognized that the encapsulation or release of guests by hosts can bring about substantial alteration in the chemical and physical properties of the guests [40 -49]. For example, Chang and co-workers demonstrated that the /uniFB02 uorescence of palmatine (PAL) in aqueous solution was greatly enhanced when encapsulated by the cavity of Q[7] [50 -53]. The competitive reaction between target drugs and the PAL for the occupancy of Q[7] cavity can result in /uniFB02 uorescence quenching, and this can be utilized for the recognition of the different drugs. The studies of Chang prompted us to investigate whether the PAL probe could be encapsulated within the Q[7] cavity to form an inclusion complex, and then whether the Q[7]@PAL could be used to sense the binding of natural amino acids.\nIn the present work, we have studied the binding properties of Q[7] towards PAL using a number of techniques including 1 HNMRspectroscopy, UV -vis and /uniFB02 uorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and found that a 1:1 host-guest inclusion complex is formed, which displayed /uniFB02 uorescence of moderate intensity. More importantly, when phenylalanine (Phe) was added to the 1:1 hostguest inclusion complex of Q[7]@PAL, the /uniFB02 uorescence intensity of the inclusion complex was dramatically quenched. However, the addition of any other natural amino acids to the same inclusion complex did not lead to any distinct /uniFB02 uorescence changes. These observations\nFig. 1. The molecular structures of Q[7], PAL and the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe).\nindicate that this system can be used for the selective recognition and determination of Phe in aqueous solution.",

When the PAL was encapsulated into the Q[7] cavity, the isoquinoline ring and the substituted benzene ring forms an effective conjugated system, which leads to enhancement of the /uniFB02 uorescence intensity. An additional factor favorable for /uniFB02 uorescence enhancement is that the degree of freedom of motion of the PAL molecule in the Q[7] cavity is reduced, thereby reducing the probability of radiationless transition. At the same time, the cavity can shield the excited singlet state of PAL from typical quenching processes that usually occur in an aqueous solution.
