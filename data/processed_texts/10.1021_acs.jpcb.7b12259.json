To assess the a /uniFB03 nity of these interactions, NMR and ITC were used to probe the thermodynamics of eight anions binding to four di /uniFB00 erent hosts whose pockets each consist primarily of hydrocarbon. Two classes of host were examined: cavitands and cyclodextrins. For all hosts, anion a /uniFB03 nity was found to follow the Hofmeister series, with associations ranging from 1.6 -5.7 kcal mol -1 .\nDespite the fact that cavitand hosts 1 and 2 possess intrinsic negative electrostatic /uniFB01 elds, it was determined that these more enveloping hosts generally bound anions more strongly. The observation that the four hosts each possess speci /uniFB01 c anion a /uniFB03 nities that cannot be readily explained by their structures, points to the importance of counter cations and the solvation of the ' empty ' hosts, free guests, and host -guest complexes, in de /uniFB01 ning the a /uniFB03 nity.",

        "content": "Although Franz Hofmeister s ' seminal studies into how salts a /uniFB00 ect proteins dates back to 1888, there are still countless open questions pertaining to how salts a /uniFB00 ect water and aqueous solutions of solutes. 1 -3 Hofmeister s early work observed that ' certain salts were capable of causing proteins to precipitate, while others caused the protein to become more soluble. For example, salting-out salts such as ammonium sulfate are the most common additives for protein crystallization, 4 while salting-in salts such as sodium thiocyanate are most often found to (partially) denature proteins and increase their solubility. 5 By this metric of solubility, Hofmeister observed the continuum of anions now named after him (Figure 1), and since that time, this Hofmeister series has been observed in over 40 physicochemical measurements of aqueous solutions. 6\nThe /uniFB01 rst picture to emerge of the Hofmeister e /uniFB00 ect was based mostly on macroscale measurements 7 -19 and centered on the idea that salts a /uniFB00 ect solute properties indirectly by changing the structure of water. 20 More recently, however, the arrival of more powerful analytical and computational tools have led to a shifting in understanding. For example, data from a suite of spectroscopic techniques suggests that salts do not signi /uniFB01 cantly in /uniFB02 uence the structure of bulk water and therefore are unlikely to indirectly in /uniFB02 uence cosolute molecules or macromolecules. 21 -29 More importantly, data from recent 30 -40 41 -43",

        "content": "Whether an anion can associate with a (macro)molecule depends on the intrinsic anion -solute interaction, the intrinsic ion pairing of the salt, 55 -58 and how strongly all species are solvated. Regarding the latter, in general terms, the further an anion lays toward the salting-in end of the Hofmeister series, the more weakly it is solvated. 59 However, our understanding of the preferred geometries, thermodynamics, and spectroscopic signatures of hydrated anions (X -(H2O) ) is limited to indirect n measurements of dilute solutions, 60 and general observations such as the stepwise removal of solvating waters only becomes energetically demanding with the last few waters. 61 -64 Even more problematic, the greater diversity within (macro)molecule solutes means that solvation of these surfaces is exceedingly complex. General descriptors of solute surfaces, such as convex, planar, and concave, can be readily invoked to de /uniFB01 ne solvation types, 65 but it remains unclear if speci /uniFB01 c subtypes of hydration  for example, the chiral spine of hydration in DNA 66  are common to other topologies and/or individual families of functional groups.\nstudies at the air -water interface, oil -water interface, -44 -54\nand macromolecule water interface all suggest that polarizable anions  those that can more readily undergo partial desolvation  interact directly with molecules and macromolecules. Correspondingly, one important and open question arising from this is how do these anion -solute interactions induce Hofmeister e /uniFB00 ects, such as anion dependent protein denaturation, in (macro)molecules?\nThe strength of an interaction between an anion and a (macro)molecule is also dependent on the intrinsic ion -solute interaction, and in this regard, it is undoubtedly concave solute surfaces that o /uniFB00 er the strongest a /uniFB03 nity; independent of the net electrostatic potential at the surface and regardless of their constituent atoms, concave surfaces allow the maximum number of noncovalent interactions between solute and anion.

Furthermore, in assessing potential binding sites, there are also those near to the surface of a protein. In the solid state, the average globular protein displays approximately 4.4 cavities per 100 amino acids large enough to bind a water molecule. 78 These are found most frequently at a depth of 2.50 -3.60 Å from the surface, and it is not di /uniFB03 cult to envisage that in the solution state these sites  hydrated or not  are available to bind polarizable species such as thiocyanate (SCN -).\nCoulombic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and van Der Waals interactions, contribute to anion binding, the denaturation of proteins, and Hofmeister e /uniFB00 ects in general.

As salting-out anions such as chloride (Cl -) were not observed to bind to host 1 , 81 we focused here on salting-in salts that are thought to associate with nonpolar surfaces (vide supra). To ensure good data collection, we augmented this list (Figure 1) with common, large, and charge di /uniFB00 use anions that might be expected to associate even more strongly than typical salting-in anions such as perchlorate (ClO 4 -). Of the 11 salts examined, /uniFB02 uoride (F -) and Cl -were not observed to bind to any of the hosts by either technique, and bromide (Br -) bound too weakly to all hosts to provide reliable data. The remaining anions, SCN , -ClO4 -, tri /uniFB02 ate (TfO -), dicyanamide ((CN)2N -), hexa /uniFB02 uorophosphate (PF6 -), perrhenate (ReO4 -), cyanoborohydride (CNBH3 -), and methanethiosulfonate (MeSO2S -), were observed to bind to at least one of the hosts using at least one technique. Typical NMR spectroscopy data, from the titration of host 2 with MeSO2S -and host 3 with ReO4 -, are shown in Figure 3. For hosts 1 and 2 , the signal from the four inward pointing acetal protons (Hb, see Figure 2) was monitored during titration, whereas for hosts 3 and 4 , the signal from the inward pointing H3 atoms was used. The maximal Δ δ values for the H 3 signal were generally somewhat smaller than the corresponding shift of Hb, but in both cases, anion complexation induced the expected down /uniFB01 eld signal shifts. These changes were attributed purely to anion association; changes in the magnetic susceptibility of the solvent due to increasing ionic strength 86 have previously been noted to be small at the ionic strengths attained at the end point of the titrations reported here.

We believe that there are several factors contributing to this heterogeneity. First, the electrostatic potential within the pocket increases from -8 V at the portal to -12 V at the lower sections of the pocket because the conical structure of the host means that the carboxylates at the rim are further from the C 4 -axis than the four carboxylates in the pendent groups.

Where direct comparisons between the two hosts can be made, it is found that 4 binds guests such as benzoic acid or phenol derivatives more strongly, typically 0.5 to 1 kcal mol -1 more strongly. 111 This has been attributed to the fact that methylation lengthens the cavity and correspondingly makes it less polar; any countering e /uniFB00 ects of the less preorganized nature of 4 due to the loss of inter-ring hydrogen bonding are not evident. 112,113\nTable 2 reveals that 4 also binds the studied anions more strongly than host 3 ; although the a /uniFB03 nities of 3 and 4 sometimes do not di /uniFB00 er signi /uniFB01 cantly, in no instance does 3 bind an anionic guest signi /uniFB01 cantly more strongly.

For example, the di /uniFB00 erence in binding pro /uniFB01 le for hosts 1 and 2 , arises in part because the methyl groups of the latter change the nature of the solvation shell of the bound anion.

As a result, binding in water is frequently stronger than comparable systems in nonaqueous media (the hydrophobic e /uniFB00 ect).\nConsidering the di /uniFB00 erent possible solvation types of molecular surfaces, it is interesting to consider the possibility of a host templating cavity formation in water. Revised scaled particle theory calculations 122 as well as an analytical equation of state for cavity formation derived from combined experimental and simulation results, 123 reveal that the energy requirement to form a cavity in water equivalent to the volume of host 1 is approximately 25 kcal mol -1 .

        "content": "These problems can be largely avoided (at least until we have a better understanding) if a thermodynamic de /uniFB01 nition of pocket solvation is avoided. Thus, an alternative perspective is to view the solvation of nonpolar concavity in terms of drying transitions or dewetting. As a function of time, the solvation of a concavity /uniFB02 uctuates between a maximum and minimum (and other intermediate solvation states), and it is the probability of the cavity being in a certain solvation state that readily de /uniFB01 nes these systems. Drying transitions have been repeatedly observed in silico: in the study of water between hydrophobic plates as well as in carbon nanotubes and protein cavities. 117,118,131,132 However, there is only a small amount of (indirect) empirical evidence of their existence. 120,133 Nevertheless, the general concept is intriguing from a supramolecular perspective. To paraphrase Cram, the structure of host such as 1 prepays the free energy costs to promote formation of a cavity within water; in essence, hosts may function as an antitemplate to promote the formation of nothingness in what is an exceedingly small solvent capable of solvating the tightest of surfaces.",

        "content": "NMR spectroscopy and ITC studies have con /uniFB01 rmed that polarizable anions have a general a /uniFB03 nity for nonpolar concavities. For the two classes of host examined, a /uniFB03 nity follows the Hofmeister series, with the more enveloping hosts 1 and 2 possessing the less polar pockets and demonstrating stronger associations. This is despite the fact that the cavitand hosts possess intrinsic negative electrostatic /uniFB01 elds that would be expected to repel anions. The fact that these hosts do bind anions, and the observation that the four hosts each possess speci /uniFB01 c anion a /uniFB03 nities that cannot be readily explained by their structures, point to the importance of counter cations and the solvation of the ' empty ' pockets, the free guests, and the host -guest complexes. Thus, future progress in understanding the Hofmeister e /uniFB00 ect must therefore include appreciating the relationship between concavity shape and size and drying transitions as well as building a detailed picture of the solvation di /uniFB00 erences of the free and bound anionic guests.",
