Scherman*\nAbstract: Supramolecular interactions between the host cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and amino acids have been widely interrogated, but recognition of specific motifs within a protein domain have never been reported. A phage display approach was herein used to select motifs with the highest binding affinity for the heteroternary complex with methyl viologen and CB[8] (MV·CB[8]) within a vast pool of cyclic peptide sequences. From the selected motifs, an epitope consisting of three amino acid was extrapolated and incorporated into a solvent-exposed loop of a protein domain; the protein exhibited micromolar binding affinity for the MV·CB[8] complex, matching that of the cyclic peptide. By achieving selective CB[8]-mediated conjugation of a small molecule to a recombinant protein scaffold we pave the way to biomedical applications of this simple ternary system.\nO ver the past few decades efforts to obtain libraries of compounds capable of binding therapeutically relevant targets have been made, in order to improve drug delivery efficiency. This research has been especially focused on antibody derivatives and synthetic receptor drug conjugates. [1-3] Monoclonal antibodies are characterized by tight and specific binding, low toxicity, and immunogenicity, however, it is often difficult to develop suitable conjugation chemistry to drugs of interest, without losing any potency, and still retaining a high production yield.

CB[ n ]s are a family of macrocyles prepared by condensation of glycouril at high temperature under acidic conditions. [20,21] They feature both hydrophobic (within the cavity) and polar interactions (at the carbonyl rims) with guests; [21] moreover, these macrocycles exhibit strong complexation in an aqueous environment with low cytotoxicity. [22,23] Within the CB[ ] n family, the eightmembered ring, CB[8], has assumed a prominent place on account of its ability to bind two aromatic guests simultaneously in its large cavity. [7-9,12,13,24,25]\nHerein, short amino acid (AA) motifs displayed within a peptide sequence are identified as specific binders with the preformed 1:1 methyl viologen-CB[8] (MV·CB[8]) complex (Figure 1). The most promising three AA epitope was translated into a protein domain, which subsequently showed retention of specific binding for MV·CB[8] with the same affinity. We thus report the first example of specific CB[8]-mediated conjugation of a small molecule to a short AA motif expressed within a protein domain, enabling the application of host-guest chemistry strategies in proteinsmall molecule conjugation.\nFigure 1.

Cys is generally underrepresented within the phage libraries; in our analyses it was found only once before selection and never after selection, thus it was excluded from this chart.\nacidic conditions (pH 5.0), the selection of Glu (side chain p K a 4.1) was unexpected as interactions between the carboxylate side chain and the carbonyl portals of CB[8] are typically unfavorable. However, this result emphasizes the capacity for phage display to select epitopes that may not be rationally predicted. Therefore, the overall residue representation analysis highlighted the selection of polar (Arg and Glu), bulky and\nPhage display is widely applied to isolate monoclonal antibodies as well as in the identification of epitopes, but also to characterize peptide/protein interactions towards a wide variety of molecules; [26-28] hence, it was selected as a promising technique to screen an extremely large number of sequences against binding with MV·CB[8]. In order to avoid any bias deriving from aromatic N-terminal residues, a cyclic phage library, PhD TM -C7C, was analyzed. Although N-terminal residues are known to be good guests, [17] the analysis of those sequences would then restrict the incorporation of a recognition motif only at a protein N-terminus.",

An extra N-terminal alanine is also present leading to the following schematic sequence: NH2-ACX7CGGGS-p3-COOH. The phage library was cast on covalently bound MV surfaces, which were fully complexed with CB[8]. Three rounds of selection were carried out: one round with a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PB, pH 7.4), followed by two rounds with acidic PB (pH 5.0). The phages eluted at the end of the third round of selection were sequenced and analyzed to obtain any information on selected motifs and amino acid composition.\nThe relative percentage increase (or decrease) of each AA residue following the selection was analyzed (Figures 2 and S6 in the Supporting Information). We expected an overrepresentation of all aromatic residues, especially Trp, which has been reported to be the strongest binder to MV·CB[8]; [17] nevertheless, the bar charts shown in both Figures 2 and S6, clearly indicate a significant increase in Phe, but a decrease in both Trp and Tyr. Residue representation analysis was further applied to understand whether specific epitopes were selected. Figure S6 shows that Ser and Thr were the most represented residues, followed by polar and positively charged residues such as Asn, Lys, Arg, and the rigid Pro. Nevertheless, the negative residue Glu was as over-represented in the selected sequences as the positively charged Arg, while other highly represented residues, such as Lys, only retained their abundance from the original pool (see Figure 2).

[17] Corroborating with previous reports, [17] formation of the heteroternary complex is mainly enthalpically driven, in only one sequence (Seq 1c ) is an additional favorable entropic contribution evident. The positive entropic contribution is likely related to the release of additional water molecules, both from the solvating sphere of the peptide and possibly the CB[8] cavity. [29]",

The main difference in thermodynamic contributions between Seq 2c and l is in the entropic term (more unfavorable for the linear sequence), suggesting an introduction of rigidity in the linear peptide upon binding.

The protein of choice for these further studies was Tn3, which is derived from the third fibronectin type-III domain of tenascin C. [31,32] Tn3 are immunoglobulin-like domains and adopt a b -fold with non-contiguous loops at both poles, which allow for a large binding surface (Figure 4a,b). Even if binding can occur at both poles of the Tn3 domain, [32] three out of the six loops exposed at the surface, namely BC, DE and FG (Figure 4b), are structurally similar to an antibody complementarity determining region (CDR) and, thus, are the best candidates for modification and introduction of specific binding motifs. [4,32]\nFrom the epitope analysis, a short three AA motif (QKF) was extrapolated, which is part of Seq 2 (Table 1), but even more frequently repeated within the peptides sequenced. In order to avoid the modification of a large number of residues, this epitope was inserted instead of the full Seq 2 in the BC, DE and FG loops of the Tn3 domain.

Residue representation analysis combined with the evaluation of analogies and differences between the three loop sequences and Seq 2, highlighted the presence of a Pro in the sequence. To clarify the importance of this residue towards heteroternary complex formation, an Ala substitution in BCSeq 2 (BC-Seq 2-P) and in Tn3-BC (Tn3-BC-P) was carried out. As shown in Figure S11a and b, the peptide and the protein were tested for binding towards MV·CB[8] and they both showed a slight decrease in affinity, suggesting the Pro might be an important, but still not fundamental, residue towards complex formation.\nSupramolecular interactions between CB[8] and amino acid residues have been widely interrogated in the literature, [12-18] but they have typically been limited to N-terminal aromatic moieties for conjugation. Here, phage display was successfully applied for the first time to identify motifs with high affinity for the MV·CB[8] complex without appending an N-terminal aromatic residue. The data obtained underline the importance of having at least one aromatic residue in the guest sequence, in accordance with previous findings. Sequencing analyses, however, point to Phe being a higher affinity second guest than Trp for the MV·CB[8] complex when the aromatic residue is not located at the N-terminus. The results also suggested that structural constraints play a role in binding as the cyclic sequences performed better than their corresponding linear analogs.\nPhage display screening resulted in selection of a three AA epitope (QKF), which was engineered into a protein domain and maintained the same high binding affinity for the MV·CB[8] complex as observed for the free peptide. The specificity of binding towards only one of the modified Tn3 domains implies that the local 3-dimensional structure of the epitope on the protein surface is fundamental towards the recognition properties of the CB[8] complex.
