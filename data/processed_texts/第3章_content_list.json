We do this by using a line-angle formula (also referred to as a line structure), in which lines represent chemical bonds.

As a result of this electron transfer, the metal atom becomes a positive ion, or cation, and the nonmetal atom becomes a negative ion, or anion.

When we know the name of a com- pound, we can look up its properties in a handbook, locate a chemical on a storeroom shelf, or discuss an experiment with a colleague. Later in the text, we will see cases in which different compounds have the same formula. In these instances, we will find it essential to distinguish among compounds by name.  We cannot give two substances the same name, yet we do want some similarities in the names of similar substances (Fig. 3-7). If all compounds were referred to by a common or trivial name, such as water $\\mathrm{(H}_{2}\\mathrm{O)}$ ,ammonia $\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\right)$ ,orglucose $(C_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6})$ , we would have to learn millions of unrelated names-an impossi- bility. What we need is a systematic method of assigning names-a system of nomenclature. Several systems are used, and we will introduce each at an appropriate point in the text. Compounds formed by carbon and hydrogen or carbon and hydrogen together with oxygen, nitrogen, and a few other ele- ments are organic compounds. They are generally considered in a special branch of chemistry—organic chemistry—that has its own set of nomenclature rules. Compounds that do not fit this description are inorganic compounds. The branch of chemistry that concerns itself with the study of these com- pounds is called inorganic chemistry. In the next section, We will consider the naming of inorganic compounds, and in Section 3-7, we will introduce the naming of organic compounds. "

Because some metals may form several ions, it is important to distin- guish between them in naming their compounds. The metal iron, for example, forms two common ions, $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ . The first is called the iron $(I I)$ ion, and the second is the iron(Ill) ion.

The fundamental unit of a molecular compound is a mole- cule and that of an ionic compound is a formula unit. A formula unit is the smallest collection of positively charged ions—called cations—and negatively charged ions- called anions--that is electrically neutral overall. A chemi- cal formula is a symbolic representation of a compound that can be written in several ways (Fig. 3-1). If the formula has the smallest integral subscripts possible, it is an empir- ical formula; if the formula represents an actual molecule, it is a molecular formula; and if the formula is written to show how individual atoms are joined together into mole- cules, it is a structural formula. Abbreviated structural for- mulas, called condensed structural formulas, are often used for organic molecules. Also used for organic mole- cules is the line-angle formula, in which all bond lines are shown except those between C and H atoms and in which the symbols C and H are mostly omitted. The relative sizes  and positions of the atoms in molecules can be depicted by ball-and-stick and space-filling molecular models. "

Likewise, the concept of the Avogadro constant and the mole is now applied to compounds, with emphasis on quantitative applications involving the mass of a mole of compound-the molar mass $M$ . For several elements, we can distinguish between a mole of molecules  (for example, $\\mathrm{{P_{4}}}$ ) and a mole of atoms (that is, P). "

Also listed are some common ions comprising two or more atoms, polyatomic ions, and typical ionic compounds containing them (Table 3.5). The naming of binary acids is related to the names of the corre- sponding binary hydrogen compounds. The majority of acids, however, are ternary compounds; they consist of  three elements—hydrogen and two other nonmetals.  Typically, one of the elements in ternary acids is oxygen, giving rise to the name oxoacids. The polyatomic anions derived from oxoacids are oxoanions. A scheme for relat- ing the names and formulas of oxoanions is given (expres- sion 3.3), and the nomenclature of oxoacids and their salts  is summarized (Table 3.6). Also described in this section are hydrates, ionic compounds having fixed numbers of water molecules associated with their formula units. "

A common phenomenon found in organic compounds is isomerism—the existence of different compounds, called isomers, having identical molecular formulas but different  structural formulas. Functional groups confer distinctive properties on organic molecules when they are substituted for H atoms on carbon chains or rings. The hydroxyl group\n\n -OH is present in alcohols (Fig. 3-10) and the carboxyl\n\n  group —-COOH, in carboxylic acids (Fig. 3-11)."

Some substances that are only very slightly soluble in water will spread over the surface of water to produce a film that is called a monolayer because it is only one molecule thick. A practical use of this phenomenon is  to cover ponds to reduce the loss of water by evapora-  tion. Stearic acid forms a monolayer on water. The mol- ecules are arranged upright and in contact with one   another, rather like pencils tightly packed and standing upright in a coffee mug. The model below represents an individual stearic acid molecule in the monolayer. (a) How many square meters of water surface would be covered by a monolayer made from $10.0\\mathrm{~g~}$ of stearic acid?
