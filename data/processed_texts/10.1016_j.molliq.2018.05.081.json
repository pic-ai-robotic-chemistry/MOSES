CBn are highly symmetric and rigid macrocyclic host having two identical carbonyl portal ends on both side of the cavity [2,3]. CBn consists ' n ' number of glycoluril units af /uniFB01 xed by a pair of methylene groups to form a cyclic structure. CBn have different cavity size and the cavity size is dependent on the number of glycoluril units (n = 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14) [3]. This rigid macrocyclic hosts do not possess monopole, dipole or octapole moment but possess quadrupole moment due to the presence of high symmetry [4]. It has highly polarisable carbonyl edges with hydrophobic cavity. The incorporation of small biologically active organic molecules inside the macrocyclic hosts are /uniFB02 ourishing area of research as it has wide ranges of applications such as drug delivery, /uniFB02 uorescence switching, catalysis, supramolecular dye lasers and many other applications over the past decennium [3,5 -17].

        "content": "7-DCCAE shows characteristic absorption maximum at 444 nm in aqueous medium as per the earlier reports [34,35,39]. Bathochromic shift was observed with gradual addition of CB7 to the aqueous solution of 7-DCCAE, but the change in absorbance value is very small on gradual addition of CB7. The changes in the absorption spectra of 7-DCCAE on addition of CB7 are shown in Fig. 1(a). On /uniFB01 nal addition of 2.1 × 10 -5 (M) CB7 to the aqueous solution of 7-DCCAE, we observed 8 nm bathochromic shift with respect to the absorbance maximum of the aqueous solution of 7-DCCAE. The changes in spectral feature indicate that there must be some changes in the environment around 7-DCCAE in the presence of CB7. The observed changes in absorbance spectra may be due to the interaction taken place between 7-DCCAE and CB7. Now the interesting question is about why bathochromic shift was observed in case of CB7 but not hypsochromic shift like in case of β -CD and γ -CD [39]. To explain it, we have to take under consideration about two factors, one is usual hydrophobic interaction along with charge-dipole type of interaction. So, cyclodextrins can provide hydrophobic type of interaction towards the guest molecule as well as hydrogen bonding but not able to provide the charge-dipole or dipole-dipole type of interaction towards the guest molecule, hence it is expected that the complex is formed between 7-DCCAE with CB7 is more stronger as compared to the complex formed between 7-DCCAE with β -CD and γ -CD, respectively. Here, the bathochromic shift of absorbance maximum of 7-DCCAE in the presence CB7 may be observed due to hydrophobic interaction in the association with the charge-dipole type interaction. Suchphenomenonwasexplainedbyconsideringthedecreaseof thepolarity around the coumarin molecule and it will destabilized the ground state leading to the observed bathochromic effect [27,40].

CB8 can provide hydrophobic environment towards the guest molecule due to the presence of hydrophobic cavity and can also provide charge-dipole or dipole-dipole type interaction due to the presence of carbonyl portal ends on both side of its cavity. From the changes in absorbance spectral features of 7-DCCAE in presence of both the macrocyclic hosts, we can say that the interaction may be taken place between 7-DCCAE with CB7 and CB8 in aqueous medium, respectively. When 7-DCCAE presents in aqueous medium its ground state stabilization energy is more but when CBn were added the polarity around 7-DCCAE was reduced as a result of which ground state stabilization energy of 7-DCCAE is reduced. Since cavity size of CB8 is higher than CB7 and number of high energy water molecule is more in CB8 compare to CB7 [3]. In the case of CB8 more number of water molecules remains inside the cavity as compared to CB7 due to formation of hostguest complex, as result of which the polarity sensed by 7-DCCAE inside the cavity of CB8 is more as compared to CB7. It may be the possible reason for greater bathochromic shift of 7-DCCAE in presence of CB7 compared to CB8.",

Such changes in the microenvironment are only possible when interaction taking place between 7-DCCAE and CB7, where the guest molecule facing more restricted environment as compared to the aqueous medium. The increase in ϕ f may be due to the reduction of different non-radiative processes. The increase in ϕ f value may be due to retardation of twisting rotation around the single bond ( a ) (Scheme 2). Here, we have considered that the complexation of 7-DCCAE with macrocyclic host takes place through \\ \\ N (Et)2 group. Again when the complex is formed between 7-DCCAE and CB7, the nitrogen atom of \\ \\ N(Et)2 preferred to have more positive charge density due to the close approximation of carbonyl portal of CB7 having negative charge density and for which the stronger interaction is taken place between them. Hence, the guest molecule was strongly associated with macrocyclic host, for this reason twisting rotation around the bond ( a ) is highly restricted in the presence of CB7.",

From Table 2, we observed that the magnitude of Δ S was smaller for 7-DCCAE-CB7 as compared to 7-DCCAE-CB8. It was reported that high energy water molecules are present inside the hydrophobic cavity of CBn [3]. CB8 have 10 or 12 numbers of water molecules inside its inner cavity [3].

Again the motion of the guest molecule is less restricted inside the hydrophobic cavity of CB8 as comparedtoCB7,asthecavity sizeas well as terminal diameter of CB8 is higher as compared to CB7. Now, consider the Δ H value, we observed that magnitude of Δ H value is higher for 7-DCCAE-CB7 as compared to 7-DCCAE-CB8 as the cavity size as well as the terminal diameter of CB7 is smaller as compared to CB8. Again the negative value of Δ H is due to columbic force of attraction. Hence, the force of attraction is more in case of 7-DCCAE-CB7 as compared to 7-DCCAE-CB8 (Table 2).

By using the SED equation we have estimated the diameter of the complex and observed that 1:1 complex is formed. From /uniFB02 uorescence measurement and isothermal calorimetric titration, we observed that 1:1 stoichiometric complex was formed between 7-DCCAE with CB7 and CB8, respectively. From 1 H NMR, it was con /uniFB01 rmed that 1:1 complex was formed between 7-DCCAE with CBn and the binding site of 7DCCAE with CBn is through \\ \\ N(Et)2 moiety not through ester moiety. From Job's plot we have con /uniFB01 rmed that 1:1 complexes are form between 7-DCCAE with CB7 and CB8. We observed that the binding strength of 7-DCCAE with both the CBn is much higher as compared to the binding strength of 7-DCCAE with CD's in ground state as well as in excited state. Therefore, CBn can be used as macrocyclic host more preferably than CD's for encapsulation of 7-DCCAE. From ITC measurement we observed that both the complexation processes are exothermic in nature. Both the complexation processes are enthalpically as well as entropically favourable process. By using density functional theory geometry and frequency of the 7-DCCAE-CBn complex was optimized. Both the complexation processes are enthalpically as well as entropically favourable process. From computational study, we found that the complexation process is exothermic in nature",
