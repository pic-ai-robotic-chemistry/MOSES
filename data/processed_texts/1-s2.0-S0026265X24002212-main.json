However, overconsumption would result in quinine poisoning. Herein, a simple, reusable, and cost-effective electrochemical sensor was presented for quinine detection, utilizing indicator displacement assay  (IDA)  with β -cyclodextrin/poly( N -acetylaniline)/graphene-modified  glassy  carbon  (GC)  electrode.  Graphene was deposited onto the electrode surface through cyclic voltammetry (CV) electroreduction to enhance the electron transfer properties. The poly( N -acetylaniline) film was introduced to inhibit non-special absorption of methylene blue (MB). The β -cyclodextrin ( β -CD) molecules were modified on the electrode surface using chronoamperometry  to  provide  a  binding  site  for  MB(probe)/quinine(target).  Through  competitive  host -guest interaction, quinine displaced the indicator MB molecule from the β -CD cavity. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( H NMR), scanning electron microscopy 1 (SEM), electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) were employed to verify the successful construction of sensor. The sensor also displayed superior selectivity over the common interfering molecules, satisfactory reusability upon reincubation in MB solution, good reproducibility using the consistent fabrication method, and high stability with an acceptable peak current decrease within 21 days. It is worth pointing  out  that  this  is  the  first  time  to  integrate  host -guest recognition with an electrochemical assay for quinine determination. In light of the IDA design strategy, the proposed sensing strategy may inspire innovative engineering methods for molecule detection in the fields of clinical analysis, food safety, and environmental monitoring.",

        "content": "Quinine, a natural alkaloid extracted from the cinchona tree bark, was first isolated by Pelletier and Caventou in 1820 [1]. It is predominantly  used  as  an  anti-malaria  drug,  and  occasionally  prescribed  for lupus, arthritis, and muscle cramps [2]. However, excessive consumption of quinine would induce adverse health effects, such as thrombocytopenia,  thrombotic  microangiopathy,  blindness,  and  acute  kidney injury [3]. The risk of these side effects would be further increased by the use of quinine as a bittering agent in beverages, a practice that necessitates strict regulation [4]. For instance, the United States, Germany, and Greece limit quinine concentrations in drinks to 83 mg/L, 85 mg/L, and 100 mg/L, respectively [5]. Due to its potential toxicity, numerous analytical methods have been developed for the quantitative determination  of  quinine,  including  electrochemical  techniques  [6,7],  highperformance  liquid  chromatography  [8,9],  colorimetric  assay  [10],\n* Corresponding author. E-mail address: yangww@hit.edu.cn (W. Yang).\nfluorescence assay [11], and high-resolution mass spectrometry [12]. However, many of these methods suffer from complex functional material preparation, time-consuming operation, extensive consumption of nucleic acid aptamers, or insufficient sensitivity.\nIn recent years, the quantitative electrochemical methods for quinine analysis have gained increasing attention due to rapid response, operational convenience, affordable instrumentation, and easy miniaturization [2,5,13 -15]. For example, Poltorak et al. [13] utilized ion transfer voltammetry (ITV) at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions  for  quinine  detection,  proposing  a  low-cost  miniaturization protocol that could be directly translated into a fabricated platform. In another  notable  study,  Du  et  al.  [15]  developed  a  signal-amplifying electrochemiluminescence biosensor, leveraging a nucleic acid signal amplification technique (hybridization chain reaction, HCR) and silver nanoclusters to effectively quantify quinine with a detection limit of 3.7 pM.

        "content": "electrochemical analytical methods, their preparation often necessitates either the specialized device design or the acquisition of costly nucleic acid  probes.  Therefore,  an  alternative  design  method  that  is  simple, reusable, cost-effective, and capable of selective quinine detection is still highly desirable.\nThe  indicator  displacement  assay  (IDA),  a  significant  strategy  in supramolecular chemistry for molecular sensing, has been widely utilized  for  analyte  determination  by  pairing  recognition  motifs  with  a signaling  unit  [16].  The  sensing  mechanism  of  IDA  is  based  on  the competition between a target analyte and an indicator molecule for the shared binding site on the host. Upon introducing an analyte into a solution containing an ' indicator@host ' inclusion complex, the analyte takes the place of the indicator from the binding site, resulting in a signal change  that  facilitates  the  detection  of  the  analyte  [17].  Thus,  it  is evident that the recognition motifs play an essential role in the sensor fabrication using the IDA design strategy. Indeed, a variety of advanced electrode materials [18 -20] and receptor motifs, including cyclodextrin [21,22], cucurbituril [23 -25], calixarene [26 -28], pillararene [29], and calixpyrrole [30], have been employed in sensor design. As the secondgeneration  macrocyclic  molecule,  cyclodextrins  (CDs)  are  one  of  the most  commonly  utilized  recognition  motifs  due  to  their  commercial availability, relative affordability, and excellent capability. In terms of the number of glucose units, native CDs are classified as α -CD,  -CD, and β γ -CD, which can be now obtained via large-scale industrial production [31]. Owing to the feature of hydrophobic inner cavities and hydrophilic exterior cavities [32], CDs can selectively bind special guest molecules by non-covalent interaction, such as Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions, to form stable host -guest inclusion complexes [33]. Although these unique characteristics position CDs as one of the most promising molecules to fabricate sensors, they typically  use  fluorescence  as  a  signal  output  [22,34,35],  requiring expensive equipment and limiting practical application.",

        "content": "In this study, a simple, reusable, and cost-effective electrochemical sensor  was  proposed  for  quinine  detection,  based  on  the  IDA  design strategy. Methylene blue (MB) and  -cyclodextrin ( β β -CD) were chosen as the indicator and  recognition motif, respectively. Graphene  was deposited on the glassy carbon (GC) electrode surface via cyclic voltammetry (CV) electroreduction to enhance the electrode conductivity. The poly( N -acetylaniline) film was modified through electropolymerization to facilitate the immobilization of β -CD and to prevent the non-specific adsorption of MB. Subsequently, the receptor β -CD was installed  onto  the  electrode  surface  with  a  facile  and  controllable electro-oxidation method. Through the host -guest recognition, the MB molecule enters into the hydrophobic inner cavity of β -CD, resulting in the successful construction of a sensor for quinine detection. The physicochemical properties of the β -CD modified GC electrode were examined using electrochemical and surface analytical techniques, confirming the successful preparation of the proposed quinine sensing platform. Various parameters influencing the sensor discrimination of quinine were further investigated to optimize conditions. In the presence of quinine, the decrease in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) peak current ( Δ I ) showed a linear relationship with the concentration of quinine. It is worth pointing out that this is the first time to integrate host -guest  recognition  with  an  electrochemical  assay  for  quinine determination.  The  proposed  molecular  sensing  platform  offered  an alternative,  cost-effective  method  for  analyzing  small  molecules  and could potentially be adapted for detecting other molecules by altering the indicator molecules and recognition motifs.",

Next, a volume of 5 μ L GO solution  (0.1  g/L)  was  drop-cast  onto  the  GC  electrode  surface  and allowed to dry at ambient temperature.

The impedance plot for the bare GC electrode exhibited a small semicircle, with a R et of about 150 Ω , indicating a low electron-transfer resistance.

Fig. 4A showed the impact of the cycle number of the N -acetylaniline electropolymerization on the DPV peak current of the pNAANI/ rGO/GC in 0.1 M PBS after incubation in a 10 µ M MB solution. As the number of cycles increased, the reduction peak current of MB gradually decreased and reached an approximate value of 0 at 30 cycles. This observation  indicated  that  the  rGO/GC  electrode  surface  was  fully covered by the poly( N -acetylaniline) film and that the pNAANI/rGO/GC electrode  effectively  can  avoid  the  non-specific  adsorption  of  MB. Therefore, 30 cycles were chosen for the subsequent experiment. According to the electro-oxidation mechanism of β -CD on the electrode surface (Fig. S1), the electro-oxidation time of β -CD is crucial to enhance the  sensitivity  and  recognition  capability  of  the  sensor  because  the deposition time directly influences the quantity of β -CD molecules on the electrode surface. Therefore, the electro-oxidation time of β -CD was also optimized. Fig. 4B showed that the current response increased with the deposition time, reaching an optimal value at 15 min. This suggested that the maximum amount of  -CD was installed on the electrode at this β point. Consequently, 15 min was chosen as the optimal deposition time for further experiments. In addition, the incubation time of the β -CD/ pNAANI/rGO/GC  electrode  in  MB  solution  is  also  an",

Due to the host -guest recognition between the MB and β -CD molecule, the DPV peak current increased with the incubation time in the MB solution, reaching a stable value at 35 min (Fig. 4C). This indicated that the enrichment of MB on β -CD/pNAANI/rGO/GC electrode surface reached saturation. The number of probe MB on the saturated sensor surface was calculated with Formula (1) and the result of 1.18 × 10 15 molecules/cm 2 was  obtained  (the  corresponding  CV  tests  in Fig. S6). Because the process of replacing MB from the cavity of β -CD is time-dependent, necessitating the  optimization  of  incubation  time  in quinine solution to achieve accurate sensor responses. Thus, the incubation time of the MB@ β -CD/pNAANI/rGO/GC electrode in a 50 µ M quinine solution was also examined (Fig. 4D). It was observed that the DPV signal stabilized after an incubation period of 40 min.

It  is  seen  that  the  MB  probe  in β -CD  cavities  was replaced  gradually  with  the  increase  of  quinine,  causing  a  gradual decrease  in  the  reduction  peak  current  of  MB  (Fig.  5A).  This  was observed across a range of quinine concentrations from 0 nM to 125 μ M. As shown in Fig. 5B, There was a linear increase in Δ I MB with the rise in quinine  concentration.  The  corresponding  linear  function  was Δ I MB ( μ A) = 1.585 + 0.382 C ( μ M) ( R 2 = 0.998) and the limit of detection (LOD)  was  1.32 μ M,  according  to  the  calculation  of  Formula  (2).

        "content": "As is widely acknowledged, real samples contain a variety of molecules  that  may  interfere  with  quinine  detection,  potentially  compromising the selectivity of the electrochemical sensor. Consequently, the selectivity of the proposed sensing platform was investigated, using over ten-fold the concentration of other common molecules. Fig. 6A revealed that KCl (1.0 mM), MgCl2 (1.0 mM), sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS, 1.0 mM), ascorbic acid (AA, 1.0 mM), glucose (1.0 mM), sucrose (1.0 mM), glucine (1.0 mM), and bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1.0 mg/mL) had negligible interference when compared to the detection of quinine at a mere  75 µ M  concentration.  Due  to  the  reversibility  of  competitive host -guest interaction, the reusability of the proposed sensing platform was studied by reincubation in the MB solution. The prepared sensor was initially immersed in 30 μ M quinine solution for 45 min and then reincubated in 10 μ M MB solution for 35 min. As shown in Fig. 6B, the developed  sensing  platform  displayed  good  regeneration  capabilities and the sensor could be reused several times. Additionally, the stability of the proposed sensor was scrutinized through storage at 4  C, with the ◦ results illustrated in Fig. 6C. A negligible change in the DPV signal was observed during the initial seven days. Despite a decrease in the signal commencing on the eighth day, it retained 86.47 % of its original value up until the 21st day. In addition, the reproducibility of the proposed sensor was assessed by measuring the DPV peak current following incubation in a 10 μ M MB solution. Seven identical MB@ β -CD/pNAANI/ rGO/GC electrodes displayed similar signals with a relative standard deviation of 2.06 %, indicating good reproducibility of the developed sensor (Fig. 6D). Lastly, the repeatability of the sensor also performed to ascertain the inter-electrode consistency. Five independent fabrication MB@ -CD/pNAANI/rGO/GC  electrodes  were  used  to  detect  30 β μ M quinine solution. As shown in Fig. S8, five electrodes displayed similar signals",

Relative errors were defined as δ /M, where δ represents the standard deviation of the measured quinine concentration and M denotes the corresponding mean value.
