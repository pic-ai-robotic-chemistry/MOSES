Light emitted by a hot radiating object can be dispersed by a prism  to produce a continuous color spectrum. As seen in Figure 8-8, the light intensity varies smoothly with wavelength, peaking at a wavelength fixed by the source temperature. Classical physics could not provide a complete explanation of light emission by heated solids, a process known as blackbody radiation. Classical theory predicts that the intensity of the radiation emitted would increase indefi- nitely as $\\lambda$ decreases (or as $\\nu$ increases), as indicated by the dashed lines in Figure 8-8. In 1900, to explain the fact that the intensity does not increase indefi- nitely, Max Planck (1858-1947) made a revolutionary proposal: Energy, like mat- ter, is discontinuous. Here, then, is the essential difference between the classical physics of Planck's time and the new quantum theory that he proposed:  Classical physics places no limitations on the amount of energy a system may possess, whereas quantum theory limits this energy to a set of specific values. The difference between any two allowed energies of a system also has a specific value, called a quantum of energy. This means that when the energy increases from one allowed value to another, it increases by a tiny jump, or quantum.  Here is a way of thinking about a quantum of energy: It bears a similar relation- ship to the total energy of a system as a single atom does to an entire sample of matter. "

Therefore, the electrons in an atom must be in motion.  If it is assumed that electrons move around the nucleus like the planets orbit- ing the sun, a problem arises. According to classical physics, orbiting electrons are constantly accelerating and, thus, radiating energy. By losing energy, the electrons would be drawn ever closer to the nucleus and soon spiral into it.

(It is easier to detect a very dim line on a dark back- ground than to detect a faint dark line on a bright background.) If sensitiv- ity is not a concern, then perhaps absorption spectroscopy might be the preferred technique. Absorption spectra are often less complicated than emission spectra. An excited sample will contain atoms in a variety of states, each being able to drop down to any of several lower states. An absorbing sample generally is cool and transitions are possible only from the ground state. The Balmer series is not seen, for example, in absorption from cold hydrogen atoms. "

A final noteworthy point is that the energy of the particle cannot be zero. The lowest possible energy, cor- responding to $n=1.$ , is called the zero-point energy. Because the zero-point energy is not zero, the particle cannot be at rest. This observation is consis- tent with the uncertainty principle because the position and momentum both must be uncertain, and there is nothing uncertain about a particle at rest. "

Although the mathematical forms of these functions (Table 8.2) are different, their polar graphs reveal that they are identical in shape but oriented differ- ently in space. The three $p$ orbitals are labeled $p_{x},p_{y},$ or $p_{z^{\\prime}}$ to signify that they are oriented along the $x,y,$ or $z$ axes. In contrast to what we saw for s orbitals, the angular functions for the $p$ orbitals do not have a constant value. They are functions of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$  and, therefore, $p$  orbitals do not have spherical shapes. We can explain the shapes of the $p$  orbitals by focusing on the angular func- tion for the $p_{z}$  orbital. By referring to Table 8.2, we find that the angular function for the $p_{z}$ orbital is proportional to cos $\\theta$ . Thus, the $p_{z}$ wave function has an angular maximum along the positive $z$ axis, for there $\\theta\\,=\\,0$ and $\\cos(0)\\,=\\,+\\bar{1}$ . Along the negative $z$ axis, the $p_{z}$ wave function has its most negative value, for there $\\theta\\,=\\,\\pi$ and $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ . The designation $p_{z}$ helps us remember that this angular function has its maximum magnitude along the $z$ axis. Everywhere in the xy plane $\\theta\\,=\\,\\pi/2$ and $\\cos{\\theta}\\,=\\,0,$  so the xy plane is a node. Because this node arises in the angular function, it is called an angu- lar node. A similar analysis of the $p_{x}$ and $p_{y}$ orbitals shows that they are simi lar to the $p_{z}$  orbital, but with angular nodes in the $y z$ and $x z$ planes, respec- tively. In three dimensions, the polar graph for each $p$ orbital consists of two  spheres tangent to the origin, as shown in Figure 8-24. The phase (positive or negative) is included in these graphs to indicate where $Y$ has positive or neg-  ative values. We will see in Chapter 11 that the phase of the orbital is an important consideration when developing modeis for describing chemical bonding. "

Figure 8-31 shows a contour plot of the value of the $3p_{z}$ wave function in the $x z$ plane in the manner of Figure 8-27(b). We notice that the $3p_{z}$  orbital has the same general shape as a $2p_{z}$  orbital because of the angular node, but the radial node has appeared as a circle (dashed in Figure 8-31). The appearance of the $3p_{z}$  orbital is that of a smaller $p$ orbital inside a larger one. Similarly the $4d_{x y}$ orbital appears as a smaller $d_{x y}$ inside a larger one. However, it must be emphasized that each plot represents a single orbital, not one orbital nested inside another. In Figure 8-31 the radial node is indicated by the dashed circle and the presence of the node is indi- cated by the alternation in color.

This rule means that we must place electrons singly in each orbital with parallel spins before pairing them to ensure that Hund's rule is followed. A simpli- fied statement of Hund's rule is that, for a given configuration, the arrange- ment having the maximum number of parallel spins is lower in energy than any other arrangement arising from the same configuration. This behavior can be rationalized as follows. Because electrons all carry the same electric charge, if the available orbitals all have the same energy, then by placing  them in different orbitals the electrons are spatially as far apart as possible. Why is the atom's energy lower when the electrons' spins are parallel? The answer to this question may seem odd: Electrons with parallel spins repel each other more, and thus shield each other less, than if their spins were  Opposite. Thus, with the spins parallel, the attraction of each electron to the nucleus is greater than if the electrons had opposite spins. The overall effect is that, for a set of degenerate orbitals, having electrons in different orbitals with their spins parallel lowers the total energy of the atom.\\* "

Not all excitations are possible; they are governed by selection rules\n\n (see Are You Wondering 8-6). Use the selection rules to identify the possible intermediate levels (more than one are possible) involved, and calculate the frequencies of the two photons involved in each process. Identify the transitions allowed when a sample of hydrogen atoms excited to the 5d level exhibits an emission spectrum. When a sample of gaseous sodium atoms is similarly excited to the $5d$ level, what would be the difference in the emission spectrum observed? "

In 1913, Danish physicist Neils Bohr proposed a theory for the hydrogen atom in which the electron is imagined to be moving around a stationary nucleus in one of many possible circular orbits, each of which  has a fixed energy and radius. By using classical  physics and imposing a quantization condition, Bohr derived equations for the energies and radii of these  orbits. Derive Bohr's equations by using the follow- ing steps. Note: Steps (a), (b), and (d) are based on fundamental ideas from classical physics. Step (c) introduces a new idea, a quantization condition, that  causes the energies and radii of the orbits to take on certain well-defined values.
