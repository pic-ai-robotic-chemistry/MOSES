Hunter* and Liming Huang *\nWater-soluble and /uniFB02 uorescent perylene dyes PMI1 and PMI2 with red to near-infrared (red-NIR) emission and a large Stokes shift were designed and synthesized. These dyes were designed to have two binding units (an aromatic perylene-core and a cationic side group) that allow PMI1 and PMI2 to form strong host -guest complexes with cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. As a result, the binding constant of the resulting complexes was determined to be in the range of 10 6 M 1 -which increased about 2 orders of magnitude compared to the previously reported perylene dye with only one binding unit. The results also revealed that the /uniFB02 uorescence emission of PMI1 or PMI2 only in aqueous solution is very low due to the aggregation e /uniFB00 ect. Upon complexation with CB8, the /uniFB02 uorescence intensity increased about 10-fold while the red-NIR emission and the large Stokes shift were preserved. These host -guest complexes can serve as red-NIR /uniFB02 uorescent displacement probes for the detection of CB8 binding guests. The successful detection of addictive drugs in urine was further demonstrated using the host -guest CB8 ·PMI1 complex and the interference of auto /uniFB02 uorescence from the urine sample was successfully eliminated.",

Perylene dyes have found widespread applications in organic materials due to their unique optoelectronic properties, excellent thermo- and photo-stability, and low toxicity. 4 However, the application of water-soluble perylene dyes as fluorescent probes has only been minimally explored due to\nDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557, USA.
