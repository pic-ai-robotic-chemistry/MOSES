The most frequently used hosts are cyclodextrins, which are valuable constituents of nanoparticle-based drug carrier systems [2].

A recent paper provides excellent overview on the advances in the recognition and assembly properties of this type of cavitands [21]. The structural motifs of SCXn complexes have been intensively examined in the solid state [22,23], but the relationship between the molecular structure of SCXn-containing supramolecular amphiphiles and the properties of their nanoparticles produced in solution is still not fully understood.

We focused on the SCXn-induced aggregation of a new family of amphiphiles possessing a functionalized quinolinium head group. Two series of quinolinium derivatives were synthesized in which the long alkyl chain was attached either to the heterocyclic nitrogen (CmC1OQ + m = 10, 12, or 14) or to the oxygen located in position 6 of the aromatic system (C1CmOQ + m = 8, 10, or 12).

Additionally, NMR results showed different incorporations of the aliphatic group into SCX4: four carbons of the N-alkyl chain were located inside the macrocycle, while the alkoxy chain entirely protruded from the SCX4 cavity. Now, we intend to unravel how such kinds of differences alter the internal structure of self-assembled nanoparticles. The variation of the molecular structure of the constituents is an appealing way to tune the shape and internal geometric arrangements of nanosized aggregates. The control of not only the size but also the morphology of nano-objects would be highly bene /uniFB01 cial in many potential applications. Hence, information on the relationship between chemical structure and the ordering of the building blocks in the course of self-organization is of crucial importance for the rational design of tailor-made nanoproducts.",

The solubility of 1methyl-6-alkoxy-quinolium iodides (C1CmOQ + I -) was low at 298 K. For example, it was lower than 4 mM for C1C8OQ + I -. The addition of close to saturated C1CmOQ + I -solutions to water brought about negligible enthalpy variation indicating the insigni /uniFB01 cant ion association of these amphiphiles even at the highest concentration reached in water at 298 K. No micelles were formed at this temperature.\nIn contrast, larger solubility could be attained for 1-alkyl-6methoxy-quinolium bromides (CmC1OQ + Br -). Fig. S1 presents the results of ITC experiments for the injection of 13.8, 14.8, and 88.6 mM solutions of tetradecyl, dodecyl-, and decyl homologues into water, respectively. Endothermic dilutions were always found and the enthalpograms demonstrated the association into micelles in the titrant solutions. In the initial stage of titration, the micelles fully dissociated because the concentration in the /uniFB01 nal solution remained below the critical micelle concentration (cmc). The small incipient increase of Δ H with concentration for C12C1OQ + Br -and C10C1OQ + Br -originated from the contribution of the electrostatic interactions among ions to the dilution heat [26]. The sharp diminution of Δ H implied that cmc was reached in the titrand solution and as a consequence, the heat evolution in this second concentration domain was due to the dilution of micellar solutions. The location of the in /uniFB02 exion point, which was determined from the minimum of the /uniFB01 rst derivative of the enthalpograms, corresponded to the cmc [27].

        "content": "WhenSCX4wastitrated with C1C8OQ + , the enthalpogram showed a peculiar shape (Fig. 1A). After the substantial incipient enthalpy ( Δ H) release, | Δ H| reached a minimum at [C1C8OQ + ]/[SCX4] = 1.4 mixing ratio, and then, increased attaining a plateau. Upon further increase of C1C8OQ + concentration, | Δ H| gradually vanished in the 5.5 b [C1C8OQ + ]/[SCX4] b 8.0 range. These trends indicate two major association processes. The initial enthalpy gain is attributed to complex formation because the /uniFB01 rst part of the experimental data can be /uniFB01 tted assuming 1:1 host-guest binding (Fig. 1B). The nonlinear least-squares analysis provided an association constant of K around 1.2 × 10 5 M 1 , -which agreed with the trend reported for the corresponding values of the 1:1 association between SCX4 and C1CmOQ + possessing a shorter aliphatic chain [24]. K varied from 4.5 × 10 5 M 1 to 3 × 10 -5 M 1 whenthe -number of carbon atoms in the alkyl substituent was changed from 1 to 6. Dynamic light scattering measurements demonstrated that nanoparticles (NP) were produced at [C1C8OQ + ]/[SCX4] ≥ 2 mixing ratios (vide infra). Therefore, the almost constant enthalpy change in the 2.5 ≤ [C1C8OQ + ]/[SCX4] ≤ 5.5 range is due to the association to NPs. These ITC results suggest that the 1:1 quinolinium-SCX4 complex formation is a prerequisite of the self-organization into NPs. The hydrophobic interaction among the aliphatic chains and the electrostatic attraction of the quinolinium head group to SCX4 promote NP production.",

The variation of NP stoichiometry with the mixing ratio may indicate that NPs are assembled by less cooperative interactions than in the case of C14C1OQ + . This is corroborated by the fact that NP formation of C10C1OQ + has the smallest | Δ H| value (Table 1). As mentioned above, our previous study suggested that only part of the N-alkyl moiety is located outside the host for the 1:1 complexes of SCXn and CmC1OQ + with m N 4. The Nalkyl fraction outside the host was too short to induce NP formation for m = 8. The protruding part the alkyl chain outside the SCXn cavity grows with m allowing cooperative binding via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions within NPs. When m = 10, the interactions are not strong enough to induce cooperative binding.",

The insensitivity of the particle composition to the mixing ratio arises from the high binding af /uniFB01 nity of C1CmOQ + to SCXn, which is demonstrated by the substantial Δ H gain upon association (Table 1). The nearly axial orientation of the alkyl chain in C1CmOQ + -SCXn complexes minimizes the unfavorable contact with the host and promotes the assembly with several quinolinium cations. Thus, the stoichiometry corresponding to charge compensation is easily reached in the associates.",

Fig. 6 shows representative results for negatively and positively charged NPs taken after adding C14C1OQ + to SCX4 solution in molar ratio of 5 and 9, respectively. Both types of NPs appeared as well-separated uniformly dense spheres, as previously reported [15 -17] for negative C14C1OQ + -SCX6 NPs. The positive C14C1OQ + -SCX6 NPs were also spherical, but some of them appeared as stacked circle planes (Fig. S13C, such structures have been reported for the NPs composed of C14mim + and SCX6 [11]). Cryo-TEM images showed comparable particle size to the mean diameter determined by DLS measurements (Table S1). Dense spherical nanoparticles were also observed for other CmC1OQ + -SCXn NPs and C1C8OQ + -SCXn NPs at different molar mixing ratios (Fig. S14).\nInterestingly, the positively charged C1C10OQ + -SCXn and C1C12OQ + -SCXn NPs provided entirely different images (Figs. 7 -8, and Figs. S15 -S17). They had non-spherical shape and internal structures showingequidistant lines about 3 nm apart in various areas of the nanoscale objects indicating periodic spacing of molecular layers. This regular spacing could correspond to the size of one self-assembled unit that is a SCXn decorated with as much C1C10OQ + or C1C12OQ + as necessary to ensure charge compensation.",

Among the different nano-assemblies formed with SCXn [11,16 -18], the ones obtained with C1CmOQ + (m N 8) were the /uniFB01 rst that led to non-spherical but structured aggregates. These structured morphologies remind the ones formed by nanoparticulate ordered mesophases of lipids, cubosomes or hexosomes [29,30]. In the present study, the nanoparticulate assemblies correspond to C1CmOQ + -SCXn associates with precise stoichiometries (vide supra) and not to C1CmOQ + aqueous mesophases.

Indeed, SCX6isknowntohaveahighmolecular /uniFB02 exibility and can adopt several different conformations among which the double partial cone structure is the most probable [31,32]. SCX4 is more rigid and exist predominantly in cone conformation which undergoes ring inversion [33]. Despite the differences in the conformational mobility of SCX4 and SCX6, the NPs of both cavitands undergo a change from disordered nanoassemblies to structured aggregates when the nature of their amphiphile constituents is altered. This suggests that the structural features of NPs are probably controlled by the modi /uniFB01 cation of the orientation of the amphiphilic guest in the host cavity and the conformational changes of the SCXn macrocycles play a less important role. The morphology of NPs composed of 1-alkyl-6-methoxy-quinolium-SCXn supramolecular amphiphile units also alters with the molecular structure of the constituents. Although each SCXn is surrounded by as much cationic amphiphiles as their total anionic charge (5 for SXC4 or 8 for SXC6), the organization of within these building blocks strongly depends on the location of the alkyl chain on the quinolinium moieties.\nFig. 7.

        "content": "When CmC1OQ + cations bind to SCXn, a few of the methylene groups close to the heterocyclic nitrogen are situated within the macrocycle whereas the alkyl substituents of other quinoliniums protrude from the cavity (Scheme 2A). Such ordering leads to looser interaction among the aliphatic chains which impedes the alignment of the CmC1OQ + -SCXn units into layers. Therefore, the formation of spherical NPs without any regular inner structure becomes preferable.\nIn contrast, the alkoxy chains are oriented outward from the host macrocycle within C1CmOQ + -SCXn segments which allows tighter interactions (Scheme 2B). Hence, these building elements can be arranged into lamellar structures. The C1CmOQ + -SCXn associates are the supramolecular analogues of β -cyclodextrin grafted with alkyl groups ( β -CD-Cn). In the former case, 5 or 8 alkoxy-substituted quinolinium cations are linked by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to SCX4 and SCX6, respectively, while 7 aliphatic chains are covalently attached to each macrocycle in β -CD-Cn. Due to the closely related structures of their building blocks, C1C10OQ + -SCX4 and C1C12OQ + -SCX4 NPs exhibited similar but less well de /uniFB01 ned morphology to those composed of β -CD-Cn molecules [10]. When SCX4 was replaced with SCX6, ultrastructuring and barrel-like arrangements were more clearly observed for C1C10OQ + -SCX6 NPs. In some cases, crystal structures are organized in the three-dimensional space with planes intersecting at about 120° for NPs comprising SCX4 (Fig. 7A) or SCX6 (Fig. S18). This may indicate local hexagonal structure. We can infer from our cryoTEM results that the self-assembly of C1CmOQ + with SCXn brings about nanoparticulate ordered mesophases. These kinds of structures have attracted considerable attention because of their large surface\nScheme 2. Structure of substituted quinolium-SCX6 supramolecular amphiphiles",

        "content": "The association features of C1CmOQ + and CmC1OQ + considerably differ both in the presence and absence of SCXn cavitands. Only the latter type of amphiphiles is able to produce micelles. The micellization of CmC1OQ + Br -homologues is exothermic if the 1-alkyl substituent is composed of at least 10 carbon atoms. The cmc diminishes about 17fold when the 1-decyl substituent is changed to 1-tetradecyl. C1CmOQ + cations do not associate because their iodide salt has low solubility. However, even the octyl homologue of C1CmOQ + is capable of assembly with SCXn into nanoparticles because of the substantial enthalpy diminution of this process. The nearly axial outward orientation of the alkoxy group fromthehostinterior facilitates the binding of as many C1CmOQ + cations as needed for the compensation of the SCXn charge. The building blocks produced thereby self-organize into mesophase domains, which are incorporated into NPs of irregular shape. In contrast, a part of the aliphatic moiety of SCXn-linked CmC1OQ + amphiphiles is included in the host. This impedes the ordering of the methylene chains into layers and the formation of spherical NPs without any regular inner structure becomes preferable. Because of the unfavorable direction of the alkyl group in CmC1OQ + -SCXn, longer carbon chain is required for the aggregation into NPs than in the case of C1CmOQ + -SCXn and the enthalpy change uponassociation alters to a larger extent with the increase of the number of methylene groups. The exothermicity and the mode of aggregation into NPs depends, to a great extent, on the orientation of the hydrophobic tail within the supramolecular amphiphile, but alteration of the macrocycle from SCX4 to SCX6 causes a minor effect. The morphologies obtained with C1CmOQ + constituents correspond to nanoparticulate ordered mesophases. Such structures attract widespread interest owing to their versatile potential applications.",
