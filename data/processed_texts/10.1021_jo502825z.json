R. China\n- * S Supporting Information\nABSTRACT: An amphiphilic calix[4]resorcinarene bearing four hydrophilic sulfonate sites at the upper rim and four hydrophobic n -pentyl chains at the lower rim (SR4A5) was synthesized by sulfonation of tetramethoxyresorcinarene. The molecular binding behaviors of SR4A5 with di /uniFB00 erent types of organic cations, i.e., singly and doubly charged aliphatic ammonium salts and singly and doubly charged π -aromatic ammonium salts, were comprehensively investigated by means of 1 H NMR, /uniFB02 uorescence, and UV/vis spectroscopic titration experiments. The competitive binding titrations demonstrate that, superior to the reported p -sulfonatocalix[4]arene systems, the stability constants upon association with SR4A5 can reach up to 10 6 M 1 -order of magnitude in water, ultimately leading to better binding a /uniFB03 nity and molecular selectivity toward dicationic guests. Signi /uniFB01 cantly, UV/vis spectroscopic experiments further revealed that the speci /uniFB01 c binding behaviors of SR4A5 with bispyridinium guests can be attributed to the charge\ntransfer interaction between electron-rich and electron-de /uniFB01 cient aromatics upon host -guest complexation.

As a good supplement to the existing well-known SC4A-based systems, it has been revealed that apart from the regular electrostatic attraction with sulfonates, the charge transfer interaction is one of the important driving forces in controlling the unique binding behaviors with SR4A5. The structural features of the host SR4A5 in this work can gather some inherent advantages together. First, the cavity of SR4A5, which resembles the one of SC4A, is intrinsically a three-dimensional and π -electron-rich sca /uniFB00 old to selectively encapsulate guest molecules. Second, the /uniFB02 exible alkyl chains on either side of the cyclic tetramers can not only access the role of amphiphilicity to enhance aggregation stability 10 but also elongate the vertical depth of the cavity, by which the resorcinarene backbone could be endowed with adaptive capacity to some speci /uniFB01 c substrates. 11 Third, the multiple supramolecular cooperativity can be stimulated to facilitate the formation of more advanced nanoassemblies in water.\nReceived: December 14, 2014\nsulfonate groups, which are the source of power for water solubility, can also o /uniFB00 er primary electrostatic binding sites especially for organic cations, while in association with these sulfonate groups, the -OCH3 moieties as electron-donating groups at the upper rim can further enhance the electronegativity throughout the whole cavity of the resorcinarene.

These phenomena are mainly attributed to the cone shape of SR4A5 upon association, which can force the resorcinarene backbone to make closer contacts with guests. Moreover, the protons of the included guests underwent complex-induced up eld /uniFB01 shifts to di /uniFB00 erent degrees, mainly due to the strong shielding e /uniFB00 ect of the aromatic nuclei of the resorcinarene.

        "content": "As discerned from Table 1, SR4A5 can form stable supramolecular complexes with all of the examined organic cations, with a maximum K S of 3.18 × 10 6 M 1 -for the G7 · SR4A5 complex. It was also found that the K S value is strongly a /uniFB00 ected by the charge number and π -conjugation. That is, the stability constants for the complexes with the doubly charged guests G5 -G8 are obviously larger than those for the complexes with the singly charged guests G1 -G4 and G9. Moreover, for the nonaromatic guests, the binding constant of SR4A5 with doubly charged G6 is 33 times higher than that with singly charged G3, whereas the binding constant is slightly (ca. 5 times) increased in complex G5 SR4A5 once the phenyl · ring in G1 is replaced by the NNN , , -trimethylammonium group in G5. These results demonstrate that π -conjugation alone is not su /uniFB03 cient to form stable host -guest complexes with SR4A5 and that electrostatic attraction should be considered as the primary driving force governing the binding strength in the molecular recognition process. Therefore, upon coalescence of the superiority of both π -aromatic planes and multiple positive charges, it is not surprising that the complexation of SR4A5 with the electron-de /uniFB01 cient guests G7 and G8 can be up to 10 7 M 1 -order of magnitude in water, which overwhelms all of the thermodynamic stability in this work. Moreover, it is noted that although G9 possesses a structure similar to those of G7 and G8, the binding constants of SR4A5 with G7 and G8 seem not to be the simple sum of two individual compounds of G9, suggesting that there must be a strong interrelation between the preorganized electron-rich cavity of SR4A5 and the electronde /uniFB01 cient bispyridinium salts arising from their strict and favorable size/uniFB01 t relationship to achieve the supramolecular cooperativity.",

        "content": "Furthermore, despite the fact that SC4A-based complexation always gives larger K S values, the molecular selectivity is signi /uniFB01 cantly improved in the case of SR4A5. It was found that the amphiphilic resorcinarene SR4A5 can readily distinguish the doubly charged π -aromatic substrates from other types of guest molecules. For example, the guest selectivity for aromatic G7 over nonaromatic G3 is as high as 3 × 10 4 ( K S,G7 SR4A5 · / K S,G3 SR4A5 · = 3 × 10 ), whereas this value is sharply decreased to 4 only 12 in the complexation of SC4A with the same guests ( K S,G7 SC4A · / K S,G3 SC4A · = 12). This signi /uniFB01 cant di /uniFB00 erence is ascribable to the molecular binding characteristics in SR4A and SC4A; that is, the former is prone to encapsulate the multiply charged π -aromatic substrates mainly through electrostatic attraction, whereas the latter can follow the rule of spherical shape complementarity between the guest and SC4A s ' conical cavity, which sometimes can override other known noncovalent forces, such as π -stacking and hydrophobic interactions. 16\nUV/Vis Spectroscopy. Apart from the regular electrostatic attraction to /uniFB01 x the relative orientations in SR4A5-involved binary complexes, we questioned whether the binding constants with guests G7 and G8 were noticeably increased by employing π -aromatic planes in the molecular recognition process. Inspired by the /uniFB02 uorescence quenching phenomena with G8 in the excited state, we continued to investigate the photophysical behaviors of G7 SR4A5 · and G8 SR4A5 · complexes in the ground state by means of UV/vis spectroscopy. It has been well-documented that face-centered stacking between electron-rich donors and electron-de /uniFB01 cient acceptors can induce charge transfer (CT) absorbance in the long-wavelength region, which originates from π -orbital mixing through intermolecular nonbonded steric contacts. 17 As can be seen\nfrom Figure 5, a new absorption band was clearly observed in the range from 400 to 550 nm, corresponding to the CT",

As shown by the spectroscopic observations, the bispyridinium guests G7 and G8 possessing multiple charge numbers and greater π -conjugation emerged into the limelight, bene /uniFB01 ting from both the electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged ionic components and the favorable CT interaction between the electron-rich resorcinarene cavity and the electron-de /uniFB01 cient pyridinium centers.

Moreover, the structuredependent molecular binding behaviors further demonstrate that when supplemented by the appropriate charge distribution and molecular sizes, the e /uniFB00 ective utilization of CT interactions can o /uniFB00 er a more powerful strategy to greatly facilitate the facile synergetic formation of stable supramolecular complexes.
