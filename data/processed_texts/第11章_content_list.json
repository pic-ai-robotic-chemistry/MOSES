It is tempting, and perhaps too convenient, to describe the stability of a chemical bond in terms of simple electrostatics in which a  negatively charged electron pair between a pair of positively charged nuclei serves as the \"glue\" that holds the nuclei together. Such a description, how- ever, is incomplete. We learned in Chapter 8 that the structure and stability of an atom cannot be explained without, at some point, invoking quantum mechanical principles. Similarly, the stability of a molecule, and the descrip-  tion of its bonds, requires principles from quantum theory. A covalent bond is, simply put, a quantum mechanical concept. "

Initially, each electron is close to one nucleus, and the two electrons are rather far apart. In other words, each electron is rather strongly attracted to its own nucleus, and because the electrons are rather far apart from each other, the elec- tron-electron repulsion is relatively low. The movement of the electrons to a point between the two nuclei reduces the electron-nucleus attractions and increases the electron-electron repulsions. As a result, the movement of electrons from near their respective nuclei to the internuclear region involves an increase in (potential) energy. Thus, by focusing only on the electrostatic interactions, it is  difficult to rationalize how the sharing of electrons has a stabilizing effect. "

Overall, each electron spends a significant fraction of its time in regions where the net force exerted by the electron on the nuclei tends to draw the nuclei together (Fig. 11-3b) and much less time in regions where the net force tends to draw the nuclei apart (Fig 11-3c).

Somewhat surprisingly, the answer is no. It turns out that the contraction of the electron density peak toward the individual atomic nuclei (Fig. 11-3a) contributes more to the energy lowering of the system than does the transfer of electron density into the internuclear region. The contraction leads to a significant decrease in potential energy because each electron is closer, on average, to one of the nuclei than the electron in an isolated H atom. "

We can unravel these effects by first developing the idea that the kinetic energy of an electron decreases as the volume of space available to it increases. Using the de Broglie relation, $\\lambda=h/p,$ where $\\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength and $p\\,=\\,m v,$  we can write the kinetic energy of an electron as $E_{\\mathrm{k}}={\\frac{1}{2}}m v^{2}=h^{2}/(2m\\lambda^{2})$ (near one nucleus) to a larger region (between two nuclei) corresponds to an increase in the de Broglie wavelength, $\\lambda$ , and thus to a decrease in kinetic energy. Therefore, the kinetic energy of an electron will be lowered when it moves within a larger region encompassing both nuclei than when it moves only in the vicinity of one nucleus. However, we know that the net transfer of electron density into the internuclear region is generally quite small and is off- set by a net contraction of the electron density toward the individual nuclei. The net contraction of electron density toward the nuclei causes an increase in  kinetic energy. The overall effect is that the formation of a chemical bond involves a small increase in the kinetic energy of the electrons. "

Although electron-electron repulsion is destabilizing, its contribution is typi- cally smaller in magnitude than the electron-nuclear attractions. The contri- bution from nuclear-nuclear repulsion is typically much smaller than that of electron-nuclear attractions for two reasons: (1) the distance between the nuclei is typically much larger than that between the electrons and the nuclei, and (2) the transfer of electron density into the internuclear region causes the nuclear-nuclear repulsion to be reduced even further.

The situation for combining $2p$ atomic orbitals, however, is different. Two possible ways for $2p$ atomic orbitals to combine into molecular orbitals are shown in Figure 11-24: end-to-end and side-to-side. The best overlap for $p$  orbitals is along a straight line (that is, end-to-end). This combination produces $\\sigma$ -type molecular orbitals: $\\sigma_{2p}$ and $\\sigma_{2p}^{*}$ . In forming the bonding and antibonding combinations along the internuclear axis, we must take into account the phase of the $2p$ Orbitals. We set up the atomic orbitals as shown in Figure 11-24(a), with the positive (blue) lobe of each function pointing to the internuclear region. Then, since the wave func- tions are in phase, the addition of the two wave functions leads to an increase of electron density in the internuclear region and produces a $\\sigma_{2p}$ orbital. When the two atomic orbitals are set up as shown in Figure 11-24(b), with lobes of oppo- site phase pointing into the internuclear region, a nodal plane midway between  the nuclei is formed, leading to an antibonding $\\sigma_{2p}^{*}$ Orbital.

The two possible ways for the side-to-side com- bination of a pair of $2p$  orbitals are shown in Figure 11-24(c-f). The $\\pi_{2p}$ bond-  ing orbital (Fig. 11-24c) is formed by adding the $p$ orbital on one nucleus to a $p$ orbital on the other nucleus, in such a way that the positive and negative lobes of one orbital are in phase with the positive and negative lobes of the other $p$ orbital on the other nucleus. This produces additional electron density between the nuclei, but in a much less direct way than in the $\\sigma$  orbital because the additional electron density is not found along the internuclear axis. The $\\pi_{2p}^{*}$ antibonding orbital is formed by subtracting the two $p$ orbitals perpendicu- lar to the internuclear axes, as shown in Figure 11-24(d). Now, in addition to the nodal plane that contains the nuclei, a node is formed between the nuclei, and this is a characteristic of antibonding character. There are actually four $\\pi$ -type molecular orbitals (two bonding and two antibonding) because there are two  pairs of $2p$ atomic orbitals arranged in a parallel fashion. "

Another expectation is that $\\sigma^{-}$ -type  bonding orbitals shouid have lower energies than $\\pi$ -type because end-to-end overlap of $2p$  orbitals should be more extensive than side-to-side overlap, resulting in a lower energy. This ordering is shown in Figure 11-25(a).

The transfer of   electron density from regions outside the nuclei to regions nearer and between the nuclei produces a significant decrease in the potential energy of the electrons and con- tributes substantially to the stability of a chemical bond.

The hybridization scheme chosen is the one that produces an orientation of hybrid orbitals to match the electron-group  geometry predicted by the VSEPR theory (Fig. 1i-14). $s p$ hybrid orbitals (Fig. 11-11) are associated with linear  electron-group geometries; $s p^{2}$ hybrid orbitals (Fig. 11-10) with trigonal planar geometries; $s p^{3}$  hybrid orbitals (Fig. 11-7) with tetrahedral geometries; $s p^{3}d$ hybrid orbitals with trigonal bipyramidal geometries; and $\\cdot{s p^{3}}d^{2}$ hybrid orbitals (Fig. 11-13) with octahedral geometries.

The numbers and kinds of molecular orbitals are related to the atomic orbitals used to generate them. Electron density between atoms is high in bonding molecular orbitals and very low in antibonding orbitals (Fig. 11-22). Bond order is one-half the difference between the numbers of electrons in bonding molecular orbitals and in antibonding molecular  orbitals (equation 11.1).
