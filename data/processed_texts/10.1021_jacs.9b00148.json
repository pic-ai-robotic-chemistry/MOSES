Exploiting the intrinsic hydrophobicity of halogen and chalcogen bond donor atoms integrated into a foldamer structural molecular framework containing hydrophilic functionalities, a series of water-soluble receptors was constructed for an anion recognition investigation. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) binding studies with a range of anions revealed the receptors to display very strong and selective binding of large, weakly hydrated anions such as I -and ReO4 -. This is achieved through the formation of 2:1 host -guest stoichiometric complex\nassemblies, resulting in an encapsulated anion stabilized by cooperative, multidentate, convergent σ -hole donors, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations carried out in water. Importantly, the combination of multiple σ -hole -anion interactions and hydrophobic collapse results in I -a /uniFB03 nities in water that exceed all known σ -hole receptors, including cationic systems ( β 2 up to 1.68 × 10 11 M 2 ). Furthermore, the anion binding a -/uniFB03 nities and selectivity trends of the /uniFB01 rst example of an all-chalcogen bonding anion receptor in pure water are compared with halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding receptor analogues. These results further advance and establish halogen and chalcogen bond donor functions as new tools for overcoming the challenging goal of anion recognition in pure water.",

        "content": "One of the key challenges in modern anion supramolecular chemistry is the recognition of anions in water, which needs to be achieved for applications in biology, healthcare, and environmental monitoring under aqueous conditions to be realized. To date, an overwhelming majority of reported abiotic anion receptors operate in organic solvents, whose lower polarity compared to that of water facilitates anion coordination via noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding (HB) and anion -π interactions. 1 In water, the recognition of anions is thwarted by their strong hydration, resulting in an additional energetic barrier due to desolvation during host -guest binding. Early examples of anion binding in water were dominated by highly charged polycationic receptors to enhance the electrostatic attraction with anions. 2 -8 More recent years have o /uniFB00 ered alternative strategies, such as the formation of strong coordinate bonds with Lewis acidic main group elements (e.g., Sb), 9,10 transition metals, 11 -14 and lanthanides. 15 -17 Counterintuitively, low charge or neutral receptors have also recently been demonstrated to be capable of functioning in aqueous media. 18 Notable rare examples that operate in 100% water include cyclopeptide macrocycles, 19,20 bambus[6]urils, 21,22 biotin[6]urils, 23,24 and indolocarbazoles, 25 where hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic e /uniFB00 ects contribute to the preferential recognition\nof weakly hydrated chaotropic anions (e.g., PF 6 -, SCN , and -ClO4 -).",

The con /uniFB01 nement of these hydrophobic functions within a shielded core of a folded receptor can create a stabilized anion binding cavity with multiple σ -holes directed in a convergent manner. This process, which drives the folding of peptides into complex tertiary and quaternary structures, has successfully been exploited by Flood and co-workers, who used a preorganized aryl-triazole HB foldamer receptor to bind Cl -and H2PO4 -in 1:1 MeCN/H2O solution via C -H hydrogen bond donors in a dehydrated microenvironment. 50,51 By combining the strict geometric control of σ -hole interactions with receptor folding via hydrophobic collapse, we present the /uniFB01 rst-ever series of charge-neutral XB and ChB receptors (Figure 1) capable of\nFigure 1.

        "content": "Receptor Design and Synthesis. Building upon our previous work on tetradentate iodotriazole XB receptors, 53 we designed a foldamer structure consisting of alternating 5-iodoor 5-methyltellanyl triazoles and 1,3-phenylene units while carrying several amideor ester-bound tri(ethylene glycol) groups to impart water solubility (Figure 1). The positioning of solubilizing groups ortho to the I/MeTe-triazoles sterically restricts the relative rotation of triazole and phenylene units. As the bulky I or Te atoms cannot move past the ortho substituent, the arms of the receptor are preorganized toward a folded state, which is favorable to anion binding. The host molecules are also clearly di /uniFB00 erentiated into a hydrophilic outer rim and a hydrophobic interior to stabilize folded conformations that contain a central cavity lined with σ -hole donors. Groups at the termini of the receptor can be varied (Scheme 1) to customize the binding and sensing properties.

In the case of azide 5b , the steric bulk of its naphthaleneimide unit prevented it from reacting with 7 under the usual CuAAC conditions. Target iodotriazole 3b was instead synthesized from 5b and 6 in a one-pot desilylation -cycloaddition -iodination procedure. (See the SI for details.) In this method, cycloaddition occurs between the azide and Cu alkynide, thus circumventing the steric restrictions. Arm fragments 3a -d were then joined with bis(azide) core synthon 8 . Finally, resulting precursors 4a -d were treated with primary amine 9 . This provided /uniFB01 nal products 1a -d via amidation of the labile ethylparaben esters in 4a -d . Following TMS deprotection of 6 , a similar sequence of CuAAC and amidation steps provided HB analog 1aH . The introduction of tri(ethylene glycol) amide groups in the last step avoids the terminal iodination of alkynes in the vicinity of amides, which tends to provide cyclized products instead of the desired iodoalkynes. 55,56 Additionally, this alleviates the puri /uniFB01 cation di /uniFB03 culties common to heavily PEG-substituted compounds.",

K 2 was 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than K 1 in 1a -c , indicating a strong preference for 2:1 binding.

Although all-ester XB receptor 2I displayed a β 2 value similar to that for 1a , its binding was much more dominated by K 2 . This may be attributed to the all-ester outer rim of 2I being relatively less hydrophilic than the mixed ester -amide functionalities of 1a . This can be expected to disfavor the folding of 2I into a 1:1 binding conformation but to enhance the hydrophobic collapse into a 2:1 complex.

In the /uniFB01 rst binding event, the highly exothermic signature is likely due to four strong halogen bonds being formed while the capped complex geometry allows I -to remain signi /uniFB01 cantly hydrated. In the second equilibrium formation of new XB is probably less e /uniFB03 cient. (As shown by molecular modeling, at least six out of the eight iodotriazoles in the 2:1 complex forms XB contacts.) This binding event must therefore be driven by the favorable entropy change associated with the nearly complete dehydration of I -and the partial dehydration of the receptor molecules. Similar thermodynamic signatures were observed for 2I and 2Te (Table S3-1).\nAmong 1a -d , the unusually low enthalpic contribution seen for 1b is an indication that XB contacts from its outer iodotriazoles are disrupted by the steric bulk of its naphthaleneimide termini. At the same time, the restricted rotation of these termini relative to the iodotriazoles is a likely explanation of the higher T Δ S . In contrast, in 1d the I -binding is unusually entropically disfavored, which may be attributed to the loss of additional degrees of freedom in its exceptionally large termini.\nChB receptor 2Te displayed a similar binding pattern to 2I , albeit with a much lower K 2 . This indicates that the formation of a 2:1 complex by 2Te is disfavored by the additional steric bulk of Te-bound CH3 groups. Because the K 1 and Δ H values are similar in 2Te and 2I , it follows that the XB and ChB interactions with I -must be of comparable strength and enthalpically driven character. The involvement of ChB in I -coordination was con /uniFB01 rmed by the large down /uniFB01 eld changes in 125 Te chemical shifts ( Δ δ ) upon titration with TBAI in CD CN 3 (Figure 3).

The multiple XB and ChB interactions were described by resorting to extra points of charge following the modeling approach reported in our previous works. 46,47,49,73 -77 The modeling details are thoroughly described in section S7 of the SI.\nThe starting binding arrangements of 2:1 host -guest complexes of 1a and 2Te were generated as follows: two receptor molecules were superimposed with the formation of a\nbinding pocket, in which one iodide was inserted almost equidistant from the eight convergent binding units. In addition, initial binding arrangements A, B, and C, di /uniFB00 ering in the relative spatial disposition of the central phenylene rings of the two individual receptors ( α phenyl rings), were considered, as depicted in Figure 4.

In A and B, the α phenyl rings of the two monomers are face to face and opposite to each other, leading to ω torsion angles of 0 and 180 , respectively, while intermediate arrangement C has an ° ω angle of 90 ° . Afterward, the A, B, and C binding arrangements of 1a and 2Te structures were subject to preliminary conformational analyses at high temperature by MD simulations in the gas phase, as detailed in the SI.
