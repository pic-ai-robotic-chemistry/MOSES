In this work, we design and synthesize a family of helix-like synthetic receptors that can bind perrhenate by forming hydrogen bonds with all four oxygen atoms of the anion. Among the investigated rigid helix-forming subunit derived from 1,1 -ferrocenedicarboxylic acid, 1,3-phenylenediacetic acid and 2,2 -(ethyne-1,2-diyl)dibenzoic acid, ′ ′ the latter one shows the best selectivity for perrhenate recognition. However, the receptor based on 1,1 -ferrocenedicarboxylic acid demonstrates selectivity to bind chloride in a 1:2 fashion. ′ The properties of the receptors are investigated in the acetonitrile solution by using NMR, UV-Vis, and in the solid state by single crystal X-ray analysis.\nKeywords: synthetic receptor; host-guest chemistry; anion binding; perrhenate recognition",

        "content": "Anions play a significant role in living systems. The design of artificial anion receptors is a challenge in supramolecular chemistry that has received great attention in recent years [1-6], moving from being an entirely fundamental area of supramolecular chemistry to a range of applications. Perrhenate (ReO4 -) and pertechnetate (TcO4 -) are considered to be the anions that are among the most 'difficult to bind' due to their relatively large size and low charge density [7,8]. These anions are available from 99 Mo/ 99m Tc and 188 W/ 188 Re generators and are widely used in nuclear medicine as a part of diagnostic imaging tools and therapeutic devices [9-11]. 99 Tc is mostly produced from nuclear fuel cycles, and it is considered as one of the most hazardous pollutants due to long half-life and high mobility in the environment [12-15]. These radionuclides exist in the generator as the solution containing oxoanions. Thus, it is a challenge to develop synthetic receptors that are capable of capturing these radionuclides in the form of 99m TcO4 -and 188 ReO4 -for further utilization. Several approaches have been recently explored to bind or extract the anions in question: the design of synthetic receptors [16-26], fluorescent probes [27,28], and inorganic materials [29-34]. In our recent study, we have elucidated how the nature of the binding sites influence the overall binding affinity of receptors [8]. The studied receptors coordinated only two oxygen atoms of ReO4 -or TcO4 -[17,19,22]. One possible approach to achieve greater selectivity and affinity is to design receptors that can coordinate all four oxygen atoms of the tetrahedral anion. Such an approach haas been already implemented for recognition of sulfate and phosphate anions resulting in a highly selective binding [35-42].\nHerein, we present a design of helix-like receptors that can form hydrogen bonds with all four oxygen atoms of the perrhenate anion. The design of the receptor consists of a rigid",

The distance between the amide groups of 7 Å is optimal to achieve binding complementarity between two oxygen atoms of the perrhenate anion and NH-binding sites. We have proposed that the introduction of a helix-forming subunit together with additional two binding sites would allow us to bind all four oxygen atoms of the perrhenate anion. Recent analysis of the literature on helical anion foldamers shows that this kind of synthetic receptors demonstrates high selectivity even in an aqueous medium [46]. Preliminary quantum chemical modeling of the receptor structures revealed that dicarboxamide derivatives of ferrocene, m-xylylene, and diphenylacetylene are promising helix-forming subunits. They are symmetrical and, in certain conformation, can reach the distance of 7 Å between two attached amide groups. Ferrocene and diphenylacetylene are the most rigid subunits. However, the latter already provides the required distance between amide groups (NH-NH distance), while in ferrocene, the cyclopentyl rings should be rotated in different directions to achieve this distance.\nchemical modeling of the receptor structures revealed that dicarboxamide derivatives of ferrocene, m-xylylene, and diphenylacetylene are promising helix-forming subunits.

        "content": "NMR-titration experiments were conducted to determine the binding constants and selectivity of receptors for anions. The tested anions include halides, hydrogen sulfate as a hydrophilic anion, and perchlorate as a representative of an anion with low surfacecharge density. Pertechnetate has the same geometrical parameters as those of perrhenate and thus we studied only non-radioactive perrhenate. Analysis of the NMR data reveals that all N-H binding sites participate in the interaction with the investigated anions. The anions with low charge-density ratio such as perrhenate, iodide, and perchlorate induce smaller proton shifts than those observed in titrations with chloride and sulfate. The fitting of the obtained titration curves by the HypNMR program [47] supports a major 1:1 binding stoichiometry. According to the calculated binding constants (Table 1), receptor 2 demonstrates the best affinity (8300 M -1 ) and 10-fold selectivity for perrhenate as compared to binding constants with other anions.

PresumNMR-titration experiments were conducted to determine the binding constants and selectivity of receptors for anions. The tested anions include halides, hydrogen sulfate as a hydrophilic anion, and perchlorate as a representative of an anion with low surface-charge density. Pertechnetate has the same geometrical parameters as those of perrhenate and thus we studied only non-radioactive perrhenate. Analysis of the NMR data reveals that all N-H binding sites participate in the interaction with the investigated anions. The anions with low charge-density ratio such as perrhenate, iodide, and perchlorate induce smaller proton shifts than those observed in titrations with chloride and sulfate.
