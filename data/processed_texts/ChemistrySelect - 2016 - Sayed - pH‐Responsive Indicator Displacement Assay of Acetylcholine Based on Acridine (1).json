Unlike Ac, the AcH + undergoes strong binding with SCX4 and their differential binding results in a large upward pKa shift for the bound dye. Dye binding to SCX4 causes a drastic fluorescence quenching, witnessing a strong fluorescence 'turn OFF', which is switched to strong fluorescence 'turn ON' by the presence of neurotransmitter, AcCh, acts as a stimulus cum competitive binder. This is a unique system showing controlled binding and release for both AcH + and Ac forms of the dye triggered by AcCh, convincingly established through absorption, pK a tuning, fluorescence modulation and NMR shift. Fluorescence 'OFF/ON' switching observed in this study demonstrates an efficient indicator displacement methodology, achieving a control over the selectivity in binding and release of the dye/analyte, having prospective uses in designing new optical sensors and smart functional materials for analytical and biological applications.",

Due to their biocompatibility, SCXn macrocycles have been widely investigated in diverse areas including enzyme mimics, enzyme assays, bio-catalysis, biochemical studies, stimulus responsive drug delivery, pharmaceutical applications, and so on. [38,40-42] Structurally the SCXn homologues possess p -hydroxybenzenesulfonate monomer units joined via methylenelinkages resulting the macrocyclic constitution of these host molecules. Depending upon the number of monomer units present, homologues of SCXn of varying cavity sizes exist, namely, SCX4, SCX6 and SCX8, containing 4, 6, and 8 monomer units, respectively. [13,41,43,44] These host molecules are cage like compounds possessing p -electron-rich cavities with multiple sulfonate groups present at one of their portal ends and the combination of these two features endow them with intriguing affinities and selectivities toward distinct kinds of guest molecules such as cationic quaternary ammonium cations, viologens, suitable chromophoric molecules, etc. [13,14,41,43,44] Among SCXn macrocycles, SCX4 is the most-suited host in the series because of its optimum cavity size.

Since the ion-ion interaction is absent in the Ac-SCX4 system, the corresponding inclusion complexes are stabilized solely by the weaker hydrophobic interaction and accordingly the interaction is much weaker as compared to the AcH + -SCX4 system. Important to note here that the fluorescence quenching observed for the AcH + -SCX4 and Ac-SCX4 systems is generally not a very common observation because dye inclusion into host cavity imposes a restriction to the rotational and vibrational motions of the dye and the encapsulated dye also experiences a relatively lower micro-polarity than in bulk aqueous phase, resulting in general a decrease in the nonradiative deexcitation of the excited dye and hence an enhancement in its fluorescence yield. Contrary to this usual expectation, however, there are limited examples of host-guest systems, where fluorescence quenching has also been observed due to inclusion complex formation, and the reason behind such quenching in most cases is found to be some kind of specific interaction like electron transfer, proton transfer, hydrogen bonding, etc. involving the encapsulated dye and the host molecule. [45, 46,51-53] In the present systems, we expect that the observed fluorescence quenching is possibly due to either electron transfer or charge transfer inter-\naction between the encapsulated dye and the SCX4 host, because the calixarenes are known to be good electron donors, due to the presence of their electron-rich hydrox-aryl (or alkoxy-aryl) groups [40,41,54-57] while acridine dyes are well-known electron acceptors.

Similar to fluorescence studies, in the absorption studies also the SCX4 host concentration required to saturate the effect is found to be comparatively much higher for Ac at pH 8.5 than that for AcH + at pH 3.5, reassuring that the interaction of AcH + with SCX4 is much stronger compared to Ac.",

Thus, the observed apparently lower recovery of the fluorescence intensity of AcH + in the dye displacement studies is certainly not due to incomplete release of the dye from the host cavity, but most likely due to an effect of the dynamic fluorescence quenching of the free dye by the uncomplexed SCX4 present in the solution, as evidently established in the present study from the time-resolved fluorescence studies, which will be discussed latter in section 3.3. Therefore, considering a bimolecular quenching constant (kq ) value of 2.5 x 10 10 M 1 s /C0 /C0 1 , as estimated and discussed later in section 3.3, the fluorescence recovery for the complete release of AcH + from SCX4 cavity can be corrected ( cf.

That even this corrected recovery is also somewhat lower than the expected 100% recovery is possibly due to the combined effect of the small fraction of the dye that still competitively bound to the SCX4 host even in the presence of the substantially high concentration of AcCh added and the possible small extent of fluorescence quenching for the released AcH + by the added high concentration of AcCh in the solution. In fact, on the addition of very high concentration of AcCh, it is observed that there is an obvious decrease in the fluorescence intensity in the present system than the expected increase, as shown in the inset of Figure 4, supporting a small extent of fluorescence quenching of free AcH + at the higher AcCh concentrations used to achieve the dye displacements.",

Four-state thermodynamic equilibrium model for the studied dyehost system considering all the stages of the binding interactions and the acid dissociation processes.\nK a 0 represent the acid dissociation constants for the free and the bound form of the dye and Keq and K 0 eq represent the binding constants for the Ac and AcH + forms of the dye with the SCX4 host, respectively. 17,[45,46] Following Scheme 2, it is expected that the large difference in the binding strengths for the two prototropic forms of the dye would lead to a significant modulation in the acid-base properties of the dye, resulting in an appreciable supramolecularly assisted pK a shift, which can further provide a possibility for its fine tuning by the use of AcCh as the suitable external stimulus. In the present study we have explored this aspect quite elaborately following the pH dependent changes in the absorption characteristics of the dye under different conditions of the dye-host-analyte systems.\nAbsorbance changes for the dye-SCX4 system at 356 nm (where the changes are maximum) as a function of pH of the solution are plotted in Figure 6.

[45,46] Comparing these pKa and pK a 0 values it is evident that the interaction of the dye with SCX4 causes a large upwardshift by about 2.2 units, resulting the SCX4 bound Ac to act as a much stronger base compared to the free Ac in the solution.\nObserved pKa shift for the dye in the presence of SCX4 was further explored in the presence of the added AcCh as the competitive binder to realize the control release of the dye from the SCX4 cavity. The pH dependent absorption changes for the dye-SCX4 system in the presence of AcCh in fact clearly demonstrate a reversal of the pK a value of the dye, supporting the AcCh induced disintegration of the dye-SCX4 complex. A typical pH titration curve for the dye (14 m M)-SCX4 (4.5 mM)AcCh (23 mM) ternary system is shown in Figure 6, estimating a pKa value of 5.6, which is very close to the pK a value of the free dye, indicating almost quantitative decomposition of the dyeSCX4 complex by the AcCh under the studied compositions of the concerned ternary system. From the observed results it is thus evident that we have effectively constructed a stimulus responsive reversible supramolecular host-guest assembly that responds efficiently to the presence of external competitive binder cum analyte, AcCh. In other words, present host-guest system can suitably be used as an assay for the quantitative detection of AcCh, a neurotransmitter, in the experimental solutions.",

[45,46] The fluorescence decays of acridine dye in aqueous solutions at suitable pH conditions were measured both in the absence and in presence of varying SCX4 concentration to understand the interactions of AcH + and Ac forms of the dye with the host molecule. Typical fluorescence decays measured for the AcH + (pH 3.5) and Ac (pH 8.5) forms of the dye, with the increasing host concentrations are shown in Figure 7 and Figure S5 A, (SI), respectively.\nThe fluorescence decays of both AcH + and Ac are single exponential in nature in the absence of SCX4 with their characteristic lifetime ( t f ) values as 30.3 ns and 7.8 ns, respectively. [45,48,49] The fluorescence decays of both AcH + and Ac show bi-exponential behavior in the presence of SCX4 host. The decay parameters estimated for the AcH + and Ac forms of the dye at different host concentrations are listed in Table 1. For both AcH + and Ac, the shorter lifetime component ( t 2 ) estimated in the presence of SCX4 host is about 1.94 ns and 0.79 ns, respectively. The t 2 component remains almost constant for all the SCX4 concentrations used, though its contribution distinctly increases with the increasing host concentration. As this t 2 component is drastically shorter than the lifetime of the free AcH + (30.3 ns) and Ac (7.8 ns) and because the dye-SCX4 systems show strong SS fluorescence quenching, we justifiably assign this component to the dye-host inclusion complexes, where an extremely strong quenching interaction, possibly",

Contrary to the t 2 component, the longer lifetime component ( t 1 ) for both AcH + and Ac shows a small but gradual decrease in the values with the increasing SCX4 concentration along with a concomitant decrease in its contribution. As understandable, in the experimental solutions there are some free dyes whose fluorescence yield is much higher than that of the SCX4 bound dye, for both of its prototropic forms. Further it is possible that the fluorescence of both AcH + and Ac forms of the free dye undergoes some extent of dynamic quenching by the free SCX4 host present in the solution. Thus, the longer lifetime component t 1 for both the prototropic forms of the dye that undergoes a small decrease in the lifetime values on increasing\nthe SCX4 concentration is attributed to the respective forms of the free dye present in the solution.\nIf the aforementioned dynamic fluorescence quenching is in fact operative for the free AcH + and Ac forms of the dye by the SCX4 host in the solution, the reduction in the t 1 values ( cf.

The k q value estimated for the AcH + -SCX4 system following eq. 5 is about 2.5 x 10 10 M 1 s /C0 /C0 1 , suggesting the dynamic quenching to occur under diffusion controlled condition. [64] For the Ac-SCX4 system, however, the estimated kq value is 5.7 x 10 9 M 1 s /C0 /C0 1 , suggesting the dynamic quenching in the present case is significantly slower than the diffusion controlled rate. [64] In any case, present results clearly indicate that the free AcH + and Ac in the experimental solutions undergo significant dynamic fluorescence quenching by the added SCX4 host, possibly involving either ET or CT interaction, a mechanism similar to the one that also happens for the SCX4 encapsulated dyes, albeit with much stronger propensity in the latter cases. [58, 59] As indicated from the t 2 values for the dye-host systems, the SCX4 encapsulated Ac and AcH + forms of the dye undergo a reduction in the lifetime by about 9.9 times and 15.6 times, respectively, compared to the fluorescence lifetime of the respective free forms in the absence of any host. It is thus evident that the fluorescence quenching caused by the SCX4 encapsulation of the dye is much weaker with Ac form compared to that of AcH + form. Similarly, the lower k q value for the Ac-SCX4 system compared to that of the AcH + -SCX4 system suggests that the dynamic fluorescence quenching is also\nmuch weaker in the former case than in the latter.

The fact that the lifetime of the longer t 1 component still remains much shorter than that of the free dye in the absence of any host ( cf. Table 1 and Table 2) is in accordance with the dynamic fluorescence quenching of the released dyes by the SCX4 host present in the solution.

The observation that the t r2 values are much longer than the rotational correlation times of the free dye in the solution is a direct support of the host-guest inclusion complex formation in the studied dye-SCX4 systems, where a large increase in the effective volume for the host encapsulated chromophores results in the longer rotational correlation times.",

For such ternary systems, interestingly, the anisotropy decays become extremely fast again and resemble very closely to that of the free dye in the solution. Present observation directly indicates that the dye-SCX4 inclusion complexes are almost quantitatively disintegrated by the presence of AcCh as the competitive binder cum stimulus. In brief, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy results broadly support our inferences drawn from steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements, establishing that the addition of AcCh leads to a controlled release of the dye from the macrocyclic nanocavity. Considering the large fluorescence changes for the AcH + -SCX4 system it is very convenient to state that this system in particular acts as an efficient supramolecular host-guest based fluorescence sensor displaying strong response towards acetylcholine as the analyte. Such a mechanism of controlled formation and breaking of a dyehost complex in the presence of an external chemical stimulus can be conceptually depicted by the presentation shown in Scheme 3.\nScheme 3.

Interestingly, it is observed that the NMR peaks corresponding to the protons H1 and H4 in the free AcH + undergo very distinct splitting into two well resolved doublets along with a large upfield shifts of ~ 0.77-0.9 ppm on interaction with SCX4. These observations clearly indicate that the dye experiences a largely different microenvironment in the presence of SCX4, suggesting the axial incorporation of the dye into the host cavity. Present observations also suggest that at least two of the aromatic rings of AcH + enters deep into the SCX4 cavity during the AcH + SCX4 inclusion complex formation. Observed NMR results evidently support our proposition that there is a strong inclusion complex formation for the AcH + form of the dye with the SCX4 host.\nTo verify the dye displacement methodology by AcCh, we also carried out NMR studies for the AcH + -SCX4 system in the presence of AcCh at ~ pD ~ 3.0. As indicated from Figure 11, the NMR spectra of the AcH + -SCX4-AcCh ternary system resemble very closely to that of the free AcH + in the absence of any host.

To be mentioned here that the well resolved doublets corresponding to the aryl protons H1 and H4 found for the SCX4 encapsulated AcH + also very convincingly return back to the merged signals as that of the free dye, on addition of AcCh in the solution, suggesting almost quantitative displacement of AcH + from SCX4 cavity by the action of AcCh analyte.\nNMR studies were also carried at pD 8.5 to understand the interaction of the Ac form of the dye in the presence of the SCX4 host and AcCh analyte. In the presence of SCX4 host, all the aromatic protons of Ac undergo moderate upfield shifts along with large broadening of the signals as shown in Figure S7, SI, in contrast to huge upfield shifts and finer splitting observed at the acidic condition. In the present case, the protons H1, H 4 and H2 undergoes ~ 0.15 upfield shifts and H 3 and H5 display ~ 0.012 and ~ 0.052 upfield shifts, respectively, supporting the Ac-SCX4 inclusion complex formation. In the presence of AcCh all the aromatic protons of the encapsulated Ac undergo slight downfield shifts indicating the displacement of the dye from the SCX4 cavity by the action of AcCh, though the effect is less prominent compared to that observed at pD ~ 3.0 ( cf . Figure 11). Thus, in the present case the dye displacement is apparently somewhat less efficient as compared to the AcH + -SCX4 system. In any case, the observations made in the NMR studies clearly supports our proposition of the AcCh stimulated release of AcH + and Ac forms of acridine dye from the SCX4 host cavity, as also inferred earlier from the groundstate absorption, steady-state fluorescence and time resolved fluorescence studies.",

        "content": "The results obtained from ground-state absorption, SS fluorescence, TR-fluorescence and NMR studies clearly indicate that the protonated form (AcH + ) of acridine dye undergoes very strong inclusion complex formation with SCX4 host, much stronger compared to the neutral form (Ac) of the dye. This observation is rationalized on the basis of strong ion-ion interaction between the positively charged AcH + and the negative charges of the sulfonato groups at one of the portals of the SCX4 host. Contrasting binding interaction of SCX4 towards AcH + and Ac forms of the dye leads to a large upward pK a shift of ~ 2.2 units, suggesting the SCX4 bound Ac to act as a much stronger base than the free Ac form. Job's plot studies unambiguously indicate the formation of 1:1 stoichiometric complexes in the present systems. The studied host-guest systems have also been testified for the controlled dye displacement from the host cavity in the presence of a competitive binder cum external stimulus, acetylcholine (AcCh), which is a wellknown neurotransmitter, resulting the construction of an efficient 'OFF-ON' supramolecular host-guest sensor for the sensing of AcCh as an analyte in the solution. Absorption and fluorescence studies and reversible pK a shifts corroborated by NMR results nicely indicate the controlled release of the dye due to the rupture of the dye-SCX4 inclusion complexes in the presence of the external stimulus, AcCh.

The kind of host induced pKa shift, modulation in the photophysical properties and the stimulus responsive formation and dissociation of the host-guest assembly observed in the present study can provide many useful applications in the areas like host assisted dye/drug complexation, controlled uptake and release of dye/drug, OFF/ON fluorescence sensors, construction of smart functional materials and so on and thus would invite many follow-up works in the supramolecular hostguest chemistry.",
